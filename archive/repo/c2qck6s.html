Dear /r/fitness, can we please stop falling victim to the Nirvana fallacy?

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Why do people feel the need for such astonishing precision or to try to hyper-optimize everything?</p>

<ul>
<li>I heard that if I chew my food thirty times per bite I can burn an extra six Calories a day? Is that true?</li>
<li>If I wear baggy shorts when I run, will this increase my wind resistance and burn more calories?</li>
<li>If I chew on beef jerky while squatting, will it maximize my muscle growth?</li>
<li>If I eat the food on my plate in alphabetical order, will that improve my body composition?</li>
<li>I understand I need precisely 1.272731 grams of protein per pound of body weigh per sidereal day.  How many grams are in the milk I mix my whey with?</li>
<li>If I push the bar up at 82 degrees during my bench press, will this maximize my pec development?</li>
<li>If I alternate riding my bike in a higher gear and a lower gear, will I maximize my quad development and my calorie burning?</li>
<li>Is IF better with a 20 hour fast?  Is it worth doing if I can only fast of 15 hours?</li>
</ul>

<p>Motherfuck... just lift, and run, and ride your bike, and stretch, and eat well and near your macros on a consistent basis.  Don&#39;t freak the fuck out over a missed day, don&#39;t freak the fuck out if you ate an extra egg, or even an extra pizza.  Don&#39;t worry about the ideal foot position for deadlifting, don&#39;t worry about the ideal hand position for benching, don&#39;t worry about the ideal height for box jumps.  Don&#39;t worry if HIIT cardio is better than LISS cardio if you don&#39;t even have an idea of what &quot;better&quot; means. Don&#39;t worry about doing Kroc rows if you aren&#39;t even doing bent barbell rows at a decent weight. Don&#39;t worry about burning an extra hundred calories a day if you&#39;re still forty pounds from your goal.  In fact don&#39;t even think exercise first when trying to lose weight.  Just do well and shit will take care of itself.</p>

<p>tl;dr: The perfect is the enemy of the good. Be good.</p>

<div class="md"><p>Hierarchy of training considerations:<br/>
1. Train consistently<br/>
2. Train optimally  </p>

<p>Training optimally is important. But it&#39;s not as important as training consistently.  </p>

<p>Edit: And moreover, you don&#39;t have to choose one to the exclusion of the other.</p>
