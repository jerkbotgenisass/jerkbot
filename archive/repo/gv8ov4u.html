As you age (30+), what health aspects do you need to keep an eye on?

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I&#39;ve recently celebrated 32 years of age, and realized I&#39;m approaching 40 really quick. I was looking into doing a routine health checkup, and this one clinic was offering tests on blood count, lipid, vitamins, thyroid, etc. But I couldn&#39;t help but think that there might other stuff that I&#39;d need to ask my doctor that I might not be aware of. I sometimes feel slugish and tired during the day, and read somewhere that my testosterone level might be low, so I should be looking into that.</p>

<p>What other tests should I look into?</p>

<div class="md"><p>People say that, but it&#39;s such a minuscule part of the equation. People just move less, and eat and drink more/&quot;better&quot; as they get older.</p>

<div class="md"><p>Yeah and that&#39;s due to their age. People get tired, need more sleep, aren&#39;t as strong / fat as they used to be, etc</p>

<div class="md"><p>Mine came to a halt at about age 6. I&#39;m only 20 and gain 1-3 pounds in a week if I don&#39;t exercise in a week. I don&#39;t even eat a lot which is the worst part and I eat healthy.</p>

<div class="md"><p>My weight has gone up and down my whole life but I always knew I could lose when I would go on my 1,400 calorie per day diet. I had a 3-day set menu where each day was 1,400 or less. Once I hit 40, I realized I had to cut down to 1200-1250 calories per day to lose weight.</p>
