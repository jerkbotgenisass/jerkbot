<div class="md"><p>I could use some suggestions for a workout. My intentions are to exercise 6x a week, 3x lift, 3x cardio. I&#39;ve been doing the <a href="/r/bodyweightfitness">/r/bodyweightfitness</a> recommended routine for about a year now, but I think I&#39;m ready to make the switch to compound lifts. I&#39;d like to see some more growth. For reference I am 6&#39;1&quot;, 185 lbs, I don&#39;t have a lot of definition, and my BF% is probably in the 18% range. I&#39;m fairly big, but again, not much definition. I struggle to do more than 6 pull ups. I had an ongoing issue with low testosterone that I was recently put on injections for, so I&#39;m hoping that it won&#39;t be such a struggle to get through workouts and all that moving forward. I&#39;ve been eyeballing GZCLP, it seems like a pretty solid 3 day routine. Does anybody have any suggestions for me?</p>

<div class="md"><p>Bruh, you&#39;re 185 doing bodyweight fitness. These two things are intrinsically incompatible with being big.</p>

<p>Do heavy compounds (I advise against following any advice regarding programming here, no one knows anything. Read Practical Programming by Mark Rippetoe.) and eat way more. You&#39;re literally on steroids now; take advantage of it.</p>

<p>(Although, it&#39;s possible that lifting heavy would have solved your low T issues by itself. It might be worth exploring before you end up with a premature lifelong dependence on TRT.)</p>

<div class="md"><p>That&#39;s kinda the plan, the bodyweight stuff has really been doing a number on my joints recently. That being said, I feel like if my T was gonna rise from exercise it would have by now, I sleep 8 hours a night, eat pretty clean, exercise 6x a week. I&#39;m really not doing anything that would bring it down either. I&#39;m not inherently opposed to a lifelong dependence on TRT, so long as I can figure out a way to do it that isn&#39;t gonna leave my legs sore constantly.</p>

<div class="md"><p>Bodyweight exercises are not intense enough to disrupt homeostasis to the degree that heavy compounds will. They are not comparable. The fact that you can get to a 600 lb squat with compounds and you&#39;ll be lucky if you pass 200 lbs doing just bodyweight exercises should make this clear.</p>

<p>To put it bluntly: bodyweight exercises are completely ineffective at developing lower body musculature because the loading is so light and the musculature so large. Bodyweight fitness <em>does not work</em> if your interest is becoming strong and big and so we can infer that the hormonal responses to this sort of activity are very different from the response to heavy compounds.</p>

<p>If I were you I&#39;d go to a gym, squat and deadlift heavy for two months, (actually heavy--its not unreasonable for you to hit a 400 lb deadlift in that timeframe) and get my T retested to see how it responds.</p>

<div class="md"><p>While I see the point that you&#39;re making, and I do agree to some extent, I do think that my issues are probably a little bit deeper than that. I don&#39;t think early humans were pulling 500 lb DLs, and probably still had T in the normal range. Like, I&#39;m not gonna be able to pull huge compounds when I&#39;m 60, I live a very active lifestyle, I think that my issues as far as my endocrine system are probably just an unfortunate hand dealt to me in the genetic lottery.</p>

<p>My dad&#39;s a year from 60 and pulls 500. At any rate, TRT when you&#39;re 60 is a different matter entirely.</p>

<p>It doesn&#39;t matter what early humans did. My only point was that maybe try exploring something simpler before you start fucking with your endocrine system.</p>
