<p>Read the first line of the wiki entry on testosterone.</p>

<p>It&#39;s certainly worth a shot. You and I both know that an active lifter will almost certainly present with higher testosterone than a sedentary person, all other factors being equal.</p>

<p>No, but he (and Andy Baker) are right about lifting more often than anyone else in the industry. And who cares who Mark Rippetoe <em>is</em>, all I did was read the arguments in his books. I don&#39;t care about anything else. The ad hominem invalidation of what he&#39;s written is so retarded.</p>

<p>So therapeutic use of TRT bringing test into normal physiological levels is comparable to performance enhancing doses of AAS? By this logic every single male with normal test levels are also effectively on steroids.</p>

<p>The guy you were talking to is already exercising. Any changes in test moving to barbells would not be clinically significant even if they were statistically significant. </p>

<p>Mark Rippetoe is wrong drastically more often than he is right. He might actually be one of the dumbest people in the fitness industry.</p>

<p>I mean you&#39;re pulling an argument to authority, questioning the authority of the figure is a valid criticism.</p>

<p>This is a stupid argument about semantics. Since TRT involves injecting yourself (or pumping your armpits or whatever delivery mechanism) with steroids, I say it qualifies as &quot;doing steroids&quot;. TRT is performance-enhancing. People on TRT have increased performance vs. if they were not on TRT.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>You&#39;re assuming the stress caused by barbells is the same as the stress caused by bodyweight exercise. Why?</p>

<p>No, that&#39;s me. Can&#39;t you tell?</p>

<p>No I&#39;m not. I don&#39;t think I wrote MARK RIPPETOE SAYS TO (if I did, it was a mistake). People should read Practical Programming and make their own conclusions. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Well let&#39;s see, first you said sumo doesn&#39;t count, so it&#39;s clear you were talking about strongman. But strongman allows straps, so if straps don&#39;t count then I&#39;m not sure what your criteria is.</p>

<p>Gibberishletters, are you just looking at things in the deadlift and saying that they don&#39;t count?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I was not talking about strongman. Don&#39;t you know that strengthlifting also fobids the sumo deadlift? Besides, I&#39;m going to start my own federation one day (called &quot;Mark Rippetoe Powershitting&quot;, no relation to Mark Rippetoe ofc) where it will also be banned.
I wasn&#39;t talking about any particular sport. I simply think that calling a conventional deadlift and a sumo deadlift both a deadlift is an abuse of vocabulary. They are distinctly different movements and they shouldn&#39;t be treated as equal when comparing the performance of a lifter, that&#39;s all.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>I only believe in ATG squats and hands-free deadlifts (if you touch the bar with your hands, it&#39;s disqualified). Anything less is cope.</p>

<p>Oh, why didn&#39;t you say so. My best <em>&#39;hands-free&#39;</em> deadlift is <a href="https://youtu.be/aSaIK9Lzlw0">1125</a></p>

<p>What is really cope (and who the fuck uses that term unironically) are deadlifts with a belt. Don&#39;t count at all I say.</p>
