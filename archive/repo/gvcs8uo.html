<div class="md"><p>its the main thing holding me back from living in my car. i dont like technology and industrialization or material possessions, so im really only paying rent for the fridge and to shit. i can shit in old protein powder jugs and shower at planet fitness, good to save money. but bulking is my only problem because eating often has been hard when ive lived in my car before</p>

<div class="md"><p>Don&#39;t shit in jugs, buy a bunch of biodegradable dog poop bags and crap in those. Just chuck them them into any public garbage can and you&#39;ll be ok.</p>

<p>It would be easy to fabricate a little bucket or something that you could line the bag with. </p>

<p>You can get the bags for free from some dog parks.</p>

<div class="md"><p>well im in school and i need to be able to access my school emails and my college website. right now the computer labs dont work at my school until august so i just limit my screen time here. mostly my issue with technology isnt the use of a computer in general, but the use of things like social media or youtube and tiktok. those are things i have strayed away from entirely and dont use, and im not very active here anymore for that reason.</p>

<p>also, i have a flip phone now. i had a mental breakdown and ran over my last phone and replaced it with a flip phone so i could avoid being sucked into the devil pit that is easily accessible technology. social media, advertising, and youtube make your brain weak and overstimulated. focus on getting big and strong.</p>

<p>AS FOR THE SHIT JUGS; its just an idea i have that i thought about a day ago, ive been keeping all my old protein powder jugs (around 15 of them right now) for storage in the future but decided they could also be used as emergency shitters. and to be clear, EMERGENCY shitters. i dont want shit jugs lying  around in my car, just once every month or so and i throw it away after the first shit.</p>

<div class="md"><p>The full text was also emblematic of gainit. &quot;I don&#39;t like eating, it&#39;s a hassle.&quot; and not being receptive to anything. Also, chia seeds have been a bird food in my neck of the woods before it became a superfood recently</p>

<div class="md"><p>it was just for anxiety and depression when i was 16. believe me, it wasnt good being on it. getting off medication, which i was only on for two months, i found solace in the woods and in the iron. my depression is there but i can fight it now and its been my bitch for years. medical professionals want to keep me weak</p>

<div class="md"><p>Sorry to burst your bubble, but if you are about to turn 19, as per your other response, then something that happened when you were 16 was not &quot;years&quot; ago. Its been 2 years. Human brains aren&#39;t done cooking until around 25 anyway, don&#39;t worry if you&#39;ve had a tough go of things so far.
It really sounds like you&#39;re on a good path right now though, and obviously Rx is not for everyone, but also, it usually takes a while of experimentation to figure out the right balance for yourself.</p>

<p>Maybe this was a half ass joke, but medical professionals are NOT trying to keep you weak! They&#39;re humans, too. Just gotta find someone you can vibe with. I know theres a ton of barriers to these things though, so like, if commiting to regular therapy right now doesn&#39;t happen thats ok for now. Literally everybody can benefit from having some sessions with a therapist/counselor that&#39;s a good fit. You don&#39;t have to have &quot;problems&quot; to glean a positive experience from therapy.</p>

<div class="md"><p>i dont feel like i need it. i definitely dont need medication, ive been insanely productive and my mindsets gotten better and much stronger since i went off of them. i dont want to pay for therapy, because ive never gained anything from it and ive been many times. i have problems but i dont feel like they weigh me down and its more just a part of life that i have no need to get rid of.</p>

<div class="md"><p>throw them away after the first shit. i wouldnt be able to handle the smell. im thinking about putting a plastic bag in a small jug and shitting in the bag though like a toilet and then just leaving the shitbag somewhere and i can reuse the jug as long as i get no shit in it. i already have an emergency piss jug, my dad recommended a specific bottle shape and it works great</p>
