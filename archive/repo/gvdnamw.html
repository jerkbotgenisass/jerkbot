<div class="md"><p>Genetics is heavily overplayed.  They are typically a very small factor compared to exercise choices and diet.  There are very few things entirely decided by genetics.  But growing up with a high intake diet vs low intake will set a pattern of weigh that may stick for the rest of your life and be very hard to get out of, but not impossible by any means.  That&#39;s all I got from my genomics and society class, otherwise the class was dumb and made me realize how evil insurance companies are.</p>

<div class="md"><p>Genetics is arguably the biggest factor in bodybuilding. Your average person has no chance of becoming Mr Olympia or even anything close to it, even if they work harder than those lifters. It’s 100% true that anyone can get respectably big with the right diet, sleep, and training but how big they can get and how aesthetic they will look is determined by genetics. That being said, this girl’s physique (while very impressive) is certainly achievable by most people.</p>

<div class="md"><p>Genetics are still an excuse for the most part. You could have the best genetics of all time but it doesn&#39;t matter if you&#39;re not willing to work as hard as they do. Sure, your average Joe couldn&#39;t win the Mr. Olympia, but he could definitely compete.</p>

<div class="md"><p>Yeah you’re right that a lot of people do use “muh genetics” as a cope, I’m not trying to knock the power of hard work. Genetics determine how far you can go, but everyone can still to far (especially since the grand majority of people have 0 interest in weight training).</p>

<div class="md"><p>Good point. It&#39;s definitely not a limiting factor for most people unless you want to look like the top 0.1% of bodybuilders, in which case you&#39;re out of luck. People just tend to use it to excuse not looking literally any better than the average person.</p>

<div class="md"><p>Frank zane may not be as big as someone like Jay Cutler.  Is it from genetics?  Maybe, but they are still top performers at the highest level of bodybuilding.  Jay cutler may have a harder time with abs, but he can still get them.  Frank zane may not bulk as easily, but he&#39;s still huge.  They can go against natural tendencies pretty well.

<div class="md"><p>not that women can&#39;t have abs, not saying that at all, but there is definitely a genetic disposition away from the type of cut you see here. women naturally carry more &quot;healthy fat&quot; by percentage.  That&#39;s why women who get visible abs are standouts (see jade cargill for some high-level &quot;female ab action&quot; and note the difference in granularity) , whereas in males it&#39;s a baseline to be expected of any person who trains seriously.</p>

<p>source: worked as a personal trainer for years and years, our gym hosted natural bodybuilding competitions regularly.  Girls DO get abs.  Those were not what they tend to look like though, even at a very high level.   I don&#39;t care about a person being trans, I support her fully.</p>

<p>but I think it does come into play when you&#39;re showing the results of your program as a sign of its veracity, and could make some girls who see it feel bad.  It&#39;s like if a transitioned weightlifter showed her one-rep max on a bench press and then said the reason it was so high above the average for females was because she did certain pushups.</p>

<div class="md"><p>Women naturally hold a higher body fat percentage then men. Men can safely go a lot lower in body fat. Shredded men will be 3-5% body fat. A woman really shouldn’t drop under 10% ever. Holding a 10% body fat is near impossible. I kept my 13-14% for about 6 weeks. I went to work, the gym, and home. Everything I ate was weighed and accounted for to the gram. I lifted 6 days a week. I was cranky and tired and burned out and was trying to figure out if I wanted to dive into bikini competing. At that body fat I had a 4 pack. My weight distributes towards my hips making a 6 pack really difficult. </p>

<p>In order to get the core strength and definition she has body weight work wasn’t enough for me. I would plank with a 45lb plate on my back (I was 115 lbs) for minutes at a time. I would strap weights to my ankles to do those leg lifts. I could cable crunch my body weight for more reps then I cared to count. </p>

<p>So a woman with a well defined 6 pack like that can’t maintain it year round and will need to work angles and flexing and water consumption better then a man would.</p>

<div class="md"><p>Fair enough, i dont even care if she is a cis or trans, she can crush me between her thighs anyday🥵</p>

<div class="md"><p>Depending on the woman 8-10% body fat is required to live. If you don’t have that your body is actively starving and freaking out at you. That percent of fat if what pads your organs and keeps you alive. An athletic female - including many in the olympics - is closer to 18% body fat.  In order to maintain a sub 10% body fat it is almost required to be on a steroid stack including testosterone.  Most healthy weight female you see will be in the low-mid 20s for body fat percentage.</p>

<div class="md"><p>Women have to carry more fat than men because we have to reproduce and we have things like breasts which are by nature, fatty. Plus estrogen apparently plays a role in fat burn. That&#39;s not to say women cannot be trim or super fit, just that in order to be healthy, more body fat is required than for men.</p>

<p>Your body fat is probably healthy if you&#39;re not having any serious issues, but you can get it tested at a number of gyms, with special scales, or approximate it at home (I googled how to and kept track that way before I got my scale)! It&#39;s also hard to tell fat percentages without an accurate tool because even a skinny person can have an unhealthy fat percentage and not display it. Bodies are weird like that.</p>

<div class="md"><p>For a lot of women, having abs isn&#39;t necessarily the healthiest or most fit look.  Considering women have to carry a baby, they will need more fat to successfully grow a child in them.  Once some women hit below a fat percentage they may stop having a cycle and become temporarily infertile.  Obviously being fit is relative, so if you are a pro athlete, having a lower body fat may be more important to your daily ability to fit into your life role.</p>

<div class="md"><p>The hands, shoulders, and the abdominal shaping all stood out to me.  I could be wrong and would love to be informed of that if so. I also fully support her and think her results are still from hard work and should be respected.</p>

<p>I&#39;m aware that everything is a spectrum and some people born as a certain sex will have strong traits that seem counter to societal norms for &quot;femininity&quot; or &quot;masculinity&quot;, even something like hand or hip structure.</p>

<p>But if I&#39;m <em>not</em> wrong, then I think it&#39;s important for other girls not to be judging their results against hers... because there is a built-in difference about that.  women bodybuilders&#39; abs are literally judged differently than men&#39;s in actual pro competition, even.</p>
