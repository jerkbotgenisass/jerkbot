<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Objective: Gain muscle, stay lean, be healthy</p>

<p>Requirements: No processed sugar, cheap, quick to make/prepare. </p>

<p>I need a meal that I can repeat over and over again without having to think too much about it.</p>

<p>My workout of choice is cycling, so probably a good amount of carbs is good. But also some protein, no?</p>

<p>Ideas?</p>
