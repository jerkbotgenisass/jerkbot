<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Ground beef just isn&#39;t satisfying me right now. I been getting 88/12 from Costco as they didn&#39;t have much options for me. When I cook my patties they just don&#39;t keep me full. Haven&#39;t had much steak lately either because I just crave bacon. 2lb daily. Had 3lb once and it made me bloated.</p>

<p>I am guessing because I am a heavier guy, 300-350 range my body wants the fat intake.</p>

<p>This is my 3rd week in, had chicken one day and man body said nope fast in first week. Mostly chuck roast the first week then 2 weeks on bacon with every 2nd or 3rd day chuck roast/ground beef.</p>

<p>Maybe i can find some 78//22 ground beef somewhere</p>

<div class="md"><p>There&#39;s someone who has been running a 30 day bacon only group, over on FB. It&#39;s been going for years. a report from 2016 -- <a href="https://www.dietdoctor.com/what-happens-when-you-eat-nothing-but-bacon-for-30-days-straight">https://www.dietdoctor.com/what-happens-when-you-eat-nothing-but-bacon-for-30-days-straight</a></p>

<p>The caveat we give here is that it&#39;s important to have fresh (as in unprocessed, uncured) meat for the vitamin C.   from our FAQ, <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/zerocarb/wiki/faq#wiki_what_about_vitamin_c.3F">https://www.reddit.com/r/zerocarb/wiki/faq#wiki_what_about_vitamin_c.3F</a></p>

<p>When meat is brined, it destroys the vitamin C -- that&#39;s why sailors had scurvy.</p>

<p>Bacon isn&#39;t brined meat -- it&#39;s cured meat. But we don&#39;t know what happens to the vitamin C in pork belly which has a conventional  cure (sodium nitrate, sodium erythrobate). So it makes sense to assume that there is 0 vitamin C in bacon and make sure to include fresh meat.</p>

<p>[Interestingly, in &quot;naturally cured bacon&quot; -- where the pork belly is cured with a a celery/cherry juice powder process  --- there is vitamin C from the cherry powder.]</p>

<p>eta: Kelly Williams-Hogan will frost her burgers with bacon dripping when she wants fattier meat. Worth a try, see if it suits your appetite.</p>
