<div class="md"><p>I would def evaluate your form if the triceps are getting overworked. Could be a sign you aren’t activating your chest enough. </p>

<p>I personally DO stretch my triceps, which is totally normal (unlike what the ‘MVP’ above me said). I do an over head stretch like this video demonstrates: <a href="https://youtu.be/xxWuioswXn0">https://youtu.be/xxWuioswXn0</a></p>

<div class="md"><p>The MVP asked why he felt the need to stretch, not that he shouldn’t.  Stretching is largely pointless and an outdated methodology for controlling soreness.  It’s only “normal” because people don’t know better and continue to waist their time doing it.</p>

<div class="md"><p>Stretching is to prevent tightness, which could lead to straining muscles. Dynamic stretching before a lift and static stretching after is essential IMO. Calling it “pointless and outdated” is a bit ignorant. No one has to stretch but there are definitely benefits. If you can’t bend, eventually you will break.</p>
