Should your shoulders completely fatigue after 20-50 wall angels?

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>My physical therapist told me that a good way to tell if have shoulder dysfunction is by seeing if wall angels give me any trouble. I find that after 5 reps, my shoulders feel fatigued, however they don&#39;t completely give out until i&#39;ve done about 35 reps. I am average weight and muscle mass for a male.  would to ask everyone reading this to repeat this test and tell me if my results are abnormal. I know that my shoulders instantly fatigue, however apparently it may be normal for certain muscles such as the quads and deltoids to fatigue easily long before they give out because they tend to feel less comfortable even if they are strong. I don&#39;t mean to jump to conclusions, as 35 wall angels may be perfectly normal before shoulders giving out, but since I will soon be a licensed physical therapist, I&#39;m being extra cautious, thanks!</p>

<div class="md"><p>What the fuck did you just fucking say about me, you little bitch? I’ll have you know I graduated top of my class in the Navy Seals, and I’ve been involved in numerous secret raids on Al-Quaeda, and I have over 300 confirmed wall angels.</p>

<p>I am trained in wall angels and I’m the top jack jumper in the entire US armed forces. You are nothing to me but just another target. I will wipe you the fuck out with precision the likes of which has never been seen before on this Earth, mark my fucking words.</p>

<p>You think you can get away with saying that shit to me over the Internet? Think again, fucker. As we speak I am contacting my secret network of Christians across the USA and your IP is being traced right now so you better prepare for the storm, maggot. The storm that wipes out the pathetic little thing you call your life. You’re fucking dead, kid. I can be anywhere, anytime, and I can kill you in over seven hundred ways, and that’s just with my bare cheeks.</p>

<p>Not only am I extensively trained in haloed combat, but I have access to the entire arsenal of the United States Marine Corps and I will use it to its full extent to wipe your miserable ass off the face of the continent, you little shit. If only you could have known what holy retribution your little “clever” comment was about to bring down upon you, maybe you would have held your fucking harp.</p>

<p>But you couldn’t, you didn’t, and now you’re paying the price, you goddamn idiot. I will shit wall angels all over you and you will drown in it.</p>

<p>You’re fuckin dead, kiddo.</p>
