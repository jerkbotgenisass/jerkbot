Herniated Disc - Suggestions?

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>U/darthluiggi  -- M/5&#39;8.5&quot;/50 yrs old. Keto since Aug 2020. KetoGains since Jan 2021. SW 202. CW 147.5. SBF per Dexa 26.5%. CBF per Dexa 16.2%. Goal BF 15%.</p>

<p>Decent weightloss doing strict Keto but AMAZING results doing KetoGains. Best shape of my life. Herniated L3 doing a dead lift 2 weeks ago (stupidly effed up my form and paid the price. Be careful folks).</p>

<p>Question: Since I can&#39;t go near weights for a while and don&#39;t want to lose my momentum..do you suggest a macro mod or any alternate back-safe body weight exercises? Currently doing 1532cal/130-150g protein off days and 1650cal/150-180 prot on training days. So close to my goal and don&#39;t want to lose this new muscle I&#39;ve gained.</p>

<p>Thanks!</p>

<div class="md"><p>Since there are so many know-it-alls in this sub, best course of action is physical therapy with possible antiinflamation injections near the site of injury. Worst case scenario, back surgery. A damaged disk is a damaged disk. Like a jelly doughnut that has been squished. The &quot;healing&quot; is the body breaking down the ruptured tissue to try and smooth it down to the point that it will not irritate any surrounding tissues or nerves. Dont only take this subs advice abviously. All disk herniations are not the same. As far as maintaining strength and flex ability, only an insane person would tell you to continue lifting weights right now. Yoga saved me physically and mentally before I moved into pilates and back to eventual lighter weight lifting. 5 year herniated disk survivor who became a yoga, pilates and personal trainer.</p>

<div class="md"><p>Ever heard of load management? When all you have is a hammer, everything looks like a nail. Throwing around your $50 certs in every comment doesn&#39;t make you more qualified or put you above other &quot;know-it-alls&quot; in this thread. Yes, yoga saved your life, yoga is everything. But just because it took you years to fix your issues doesn&#39;t mean there&#39;s a reason to scare the OP with surgeries or laying off the weights for years. As a herniated disc survivor who fixed back pain with deadlift and squat, I say your experience is irrelevant in this matter of getting back to lifting. I bet OP can find a variation of a pull with LIGHT weight that doesn&#39;t aggravate the pain. Same goes with benching and squatting, be it high bar or front squat, flat bench, floor press or feet up to unload the lower back. Whatever doesn&#39;t cause pain OP should do.</p>

<div class="md"><p>Sounds like you dont know what the word &quot;could&quot; means. I said it could take years. There is no lie. Thousands of dollars of certs, years of training and being good enough to work in a PT clinic rehabing patients superceeds your fear and ego. Are you going to be there for OP if it gets worse? I believe not.</p>

<p>Talking about yourself there? Are you having a hard time when someone questions you?</p>

<p>Doing fuck all and drinking water isn&#39;t going to make his situation any better.</p>

<div class="md"><p>I understand that you feel embarrassed about your level of reading comprehension. It&#39;s ok. People misread all the time. I feel your passion for OP and his situation. Next time take a deep breath and think a little bit more before you decide to type without thinking. I believe in you.</p>
