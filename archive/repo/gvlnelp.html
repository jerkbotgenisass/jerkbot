<p>Some Women on Reddit say that most women don‚Äôt even like the super muscular body type on men, and prefer guys that are just thin, or slim/athletic. Yet in real life I have never seen women swooning over a guy with this kind of body type.</p>

<p>On the other hand, I‚Äôve hung out with some muscular men, and the way women throw themselves at these guys is ridiculous. Just the open flirtations, the touching the arms and chest, the compliments, the hints to ‚Äúhang out later‚Äù.</p>

<p>So either some women on Reddit are lying to make us regular guys feel better, in which case, thank you, that‚Äôs so nice üòå</p>

<p>Or the women on Reddit who say they‚Äôre into regular guys are a very small minority that are actually the opposite of how women in real life feel towards men‚Äôs body types.</p>

<p>Anyhow, let‚Äôs discuss, I‚Äôm open to learning and understanding your perspective.</p>

<div class="md"><p>Exactly, if I look around I see tons of women talking abiut boybands for example- none of the guys in 1D or BTS are even a little muscular</p>

<div class="md"><p>Skinny yeah, but some of them are definitely muscular. I mean Jimin‚Äôs whole thing in the beginning was his abs, and fans go wild whenever Jungkook shows even the slightest hint of skin.</p>

<div class="md"><p>In what world is that considered muscular? A tiny highschooler body eith abs isn&#39;t muscular, just really skinny.</p>

<div class="md"><p>I mean if you google it you‚Äôll see Jimin clearly has muscles, not just skinny abs. They‚Äôre slim as hell because they don‚Äôt eat much and dance constantly meaning they have about 0 body fat, but they definitely have muscles.</p>

<div class="md"><p>Dunno, I googled him quickly and only found pictures of a skinny kid. Looking defined is different from being muscular, he&#39;s just insanely skinny, kind of like a marathon runner. In real life he&#39;d look absolutely tiny.</p>

<div class="md"><p>Bro you‚Äôre fucking delusional I‚Äôm sorry. You have to be one of those fluffy dudes who think anyone smaller than you is tiny. </p>

<p>I googled the guy too, he definitely has some chest, shoulders, delt cuts, and strong healthy abs, not skinny middle school abs. I was totally prepared to shit on him, but the dude is actually pretty fucking ripped. That dude looks normal, wouldn‚Äôt be considered ‚Äúskinny‚Äù in any gym ever. </p>

<p>You must clearly not workout, because there is a common phrase. You can be ripped or you can be big...but you can‚Äôt be both. That dude is cut to the absolute fucking gills while keeping a decent amount of muscle mass. Fuck off fatty.</p>

<div class="md"><p>Yeah, you think that a 130lbs twink (googled the weight) is muscular and I&#39;M the one who doesn&#39;t workout? Thanks for the laugh.</p>

<p>Also, I&#39;ve heard that phrase before... but only from weak and small people on Reddit. Eat up skeleton.</p>
