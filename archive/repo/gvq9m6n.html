<p>What type should I get? Are figure 8 the best?</p>

<div class="md"><p>What is the weight? At a certain weight it makes sense but you could just get stronger hands. Use chalk, but if the weight is risking injury use straps.</p>

<p>I&#39;m 16, lat pulldown is around 75kg, deadlifting just over 100kg.</p>

<div class="md"><p>You shouldn&#39;t need straps to deadlift 100kg.</p>

<p>And you shouldn&#39;t be able to lat pull down 75% of your deadlift. Either there&#39;s a significant form issue or the pulley system makes it actually half that weight.</p>

<p>Using straps now will hide poor form and poor grip strength, it will cause trouble in the future.</p>

<div class="md"><p>How would straps hide poor form?</p>

<p>I started using straps at 275, deadlifted exclusively with straps until about 450, and even now I only get about another 10kg out of straps.</p>

<div class="md"><p>Using straps now will handicap your grip strength.
Edit: They do make a goo that works like chalk, idk what its called but its a thing.</p>

<div class="md"><p>I would argue that if grip is the limiting factor, then get the straps and start doing some more direct grip training. It would be silly to handicap your potential growth of muscle and strength because the weight is &quot;too light&quot; for straps or whatever.</p>

<p>FWIW, I&#39;ve trained deadlifts exclusively with straps for over a year with no direct grip training and didn&#39;t feel like my grip was handicapped because of it.</p>

<div class="md"><p>How would you know? You used straps exclusively. It would be different if you used straps on one hand and not the other and then grip strength was the same in both hands, then wed have evidence that they do not interfere with grip.</p>

<div class="md"><p>Because I&#39;ve only ever gotten about 10kg out of my straps on deadlifts? Sure, it&#39;s a difference, but it&#39;s really not that significant for me. Some people get more out of them, others don&#39;t. </p>

<p>After that year of lifting with straps, I had a max around 440x5. Took two weeks off completely, came back and hit 450 with mixed grip at RPE 8. Since then I&#39;ve started doing more raw training because, while I don&#39;t compete, I&#39;d like to at some point.</p>

<p>I do believe my point still stands, though; there&#39;s no reason to let your grip be the limiting factor.</p>

<div class="md"><p>So you lifted more without straps. <a href="/u/ostaapp">u/ostaapp</a> This is proof straps hold you back.</p>

<div class="md"><p>If having a very comparable raw max to my strapped max after a year of exclusive strap training is what you consider &quot;holding me back,&quot; then sure.</p>

<p>You know what I think holds you back? Your grip if you refuse to use straps even though you could get more quality reps by using them.</p>
