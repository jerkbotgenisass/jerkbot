<div class="md"><p>Um ... can you name <em>one</em> for us?</p>

<p>Powerlifting has weight classes, but it&#39;s the highest total for a class that wins. I mean you can get an additional trophy for a high Wilks/IPF Points/whatever pet coefficient the fed has -- but that it. Well, and ties go to the person with the lower weigh-in weight. But &quot;Based off weight and percentages&quot;? That&#39;s an absolute lie.</p>

<p>Weightlifting is the same. Weight classes, medals for each lift, and medals for totals. Highest Sinclair gets another trophy or pat on the back -- but literally no one ever has won an Olympic Gold Medal for Sinclair score.</p>

<p>Strongman is finally something different -- because the top Pro men can be any bodyweight, and they all have to lift the same weights. It&#39;s literally the one sport that is least likely to care about weight as a percentage of bodyweight. And yes, there are weight classes in the sport too.</p>

<p>You have no fucking idea what you&#39;re talking about. You&#39;re not even doing a good job of pretending to know what you&#39;re talking about. Shut. Up.</p>

<div class="md"><p>I understand you have to somehow cope for being so weak while talking down to others but this is completely wrong. Lift/weight ratio is only really good for comparing people of roughly the same height and weight. That&#39;s why they don&#39;t compare lifts like this in any kind of competition.</p>

<p>No they aren&#39;t lol. The squat WR for example starts at 5.65x bodyweight in the 114 class. Drops to the low 4&#39;s above 131, drops below 4 past the 242s and hits 2.98 in the SHW class.  The BW to weight lifted ratio is 1.9x larger in the smallest weight class than the largest class.</p>

<p>In fact weight lifted to bodyweight ratio is so terribly inconsistent that powerlifting invented the Wilks formula, and Oly lifting the Sinclair formula to better compare between classes.</p>

<div class="md"><p>This is demonstrably false. It goes against the results and basic biology. </p>

<p>Feel free to look up the totals of, say, the top 50 competitors for each class on openpowerlifting, average them, then look at % of bodyweight that that average is. It&#39;ll keep going down every weight class. </p>

<p>Then read up on the square cube law and it&#39;s relevance to muscular strength potential.</p>
