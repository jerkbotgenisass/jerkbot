<div class="md"><p>Can someone recommend a page that has a variety of 3 and 4 day gym plans, and has a variety of plan types ? (PPL, 5/3/1, 5x5, etc)?. Just like to swap plans every couple of months for muscle memory as it helps promote growth but struggling to find a good variety</p>

<div class="md"><p>Muscle memory and promoting growth is not a thing.  What promotes muscle growth is progressive overload and enough challenging sets per week.</p>

<div class="md"><p>I have seen plenty of written studies and posts about the importance of changing up your plan every 6-10wks. I may not have used the correct terminology (muscle memory and promoting growth), and I&#39;m aware of progressive overload but you can&#39;t just do the same plan forever</p>

<div class="md"><p>No, you can’t run the exact same plan forever, but you could easily run a template that works forever.  There isn’t anything magical about how muscles grow and they don’t get “used” to doing bench, squats, deads, etc.  They get better at it and require more weight or reps, but you don’t magically get more gains by changing exercises or programs.</p>

<p>Muscle confusion was simply a marketing term generated by beach body to sell P90 and P90x.</p>

<div class="md"><blockquote>
<p>If you continue to follow a workout without any change</p>
</blockquote>

<p>No one is suggesting this under any circumstance.  Progressive overload is change.  In fact, all three authors highlighted in that article (none of which are authorities on the subject I should add) listed sets/reps/weight as the number one thing to change, which is what progressive overload is.</p>

<p>Edit:  I just saw your comment from yesterday that you think the wiki plans are overrated and honestly, I have to question your understanding of exercise science and how strength/muscle is built.  What would lead you to believe those programs are overrated and what programs would you advise?  What success have you had with other programs or coaching others with other programs that you can point to?</p>
