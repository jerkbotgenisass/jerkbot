<div class="md"><p>so you train the same muscle about once every 600 days? Would really love to hear what tongue day looks like. Also still looking for a good Buccinator routine, if you mind sharing.</p>

<p>Considering this, your progress seems to be right on track for that type of split. If you want something faster you might wanna check out some of the recommended routines in the wiki. If you really want to work out nearly everyday the PPL split described there would be most fitting to that schedule.</p>
