<div class="md"><p>Is this true? I&#39;ve heard time and time again that a maintenance recomp is god awful slow for most people aside from complete newbies or people who are quite quite overweight.</p>

<div class="md"><p>So you&#39;ll put on more muscle but also more fat with a real bulk but then you gotta spend (usually) a similar amount of time losing that gained fat with your cut, where unfortunately you may lose some muscle as well. </p>

<p>With a recomp obviously you won&#39;t be putting on the same muscle as if you were bulking but in the long run its comparable and has some benefits for people who either eat too much or not enough normally. </p>

<p>Ultimately I feel like it just comes down to which one you&#39;d rather do and which one your body responds to better. Bulking sounds nice and all but a lot of people struggle with self control in regards to not overeating and then actually being dedicated on the cut. While in a recomp some may respond better to consistent slightly above maintenance calories.</p>

<p>Just for reference, I&#39;m bulking/cutting right now (in the cut ðŸ˜­)</p>

</blockquote>

<p>If you have a more conservative bulk, this shouldn&#39;t be the case. You can reasonably lose a pound of fat every week without losing any muscle. If you aim to gain a pound every 2 weeks during a bulk (which is a conservative 250kcal surplus), 80~ percent of it will be muscle if you&#39;re training.</p>

<p>My understanding is that at least within scientific literature that recomp is a snail&#39;s pace for anyone who isn&#39;t either very overweight or is brand new to lifting/coming off of a long lay off. Recomp isn&#39;t viable in the long term for those who want to make serious muscle gains, it just goes too slow.</p>

<div class="md"><p>I updated the first point to say you may lose muscle cause you&#39;re right.</p>

<p>For the second point plenty of IFBB pro bodybuilders don&#39;t even do a real &quot;bulk&quot;, just slightly above maintenance and retain lower levels of bf%, its just preference and different bodies respond differently and more effectively. Also the mental aspect is a big part of it. Recomp is a viable longterm strategy for gaining muscle.</p>

<p>I mean, bulking is eating above maintenance. If they&#39;re eating 200cal a day above maintenance, that&#39;s a bulk, not a recomp.</p>

<p>Believe me when I say I would love for this to be true, but you just haven&#39;t really provided anything to suggest this, and it goes against what I&#39;ve seen said by most people here and in books I&#39;ve read about fitness.</p>

<div class="md"><p>I mean yea a recomp is a bulk.. that&#39;s what it is, from my perspective I&#39;ve seen similar results from both, books aren&#39;t applicable to every single case unfortunately.</p>

<p>From your perspective you can&#39;t gain muscle while losing fat, from mine, you can.</p>
