<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>To that I would add that the weight loss dogma is always build more muscle because if not, a billion dollar+ industry goes down the drain. Trainers would lose their jobs. Which isn’t to say that people shouldnt train and fast. But that dogma always shits on fasting for that reason.</p>

<div class="md"><p>Workouts do matter but emotional regulation and diet matter more.</p>

<p>It&#39;s all CICO. Say an hour of fitness a day is 300 calories. Now look at a bottle of coke, that&#39;s 240 calories. Which is easier to change?</p>

<p>Here&#39;s a reference for what you can burn.</p>

<div class="md"><blockquote>
<p>It’s all CICO</p>

<p>It isn’t that simple and boiling it down to that is the main reason so many dieters fail.  Hormones, gut bacteria, metabolic rates, genetics, types of foods consumed, etc, all have varying degrees of impact on weight gain or loss.  There is overwhelming evidence now that microbes play a significant role in weight regulation and contribute to weight homeostasis, regardless of CI.</p>

<div class="md"><p>Those all do have an impact. You also forgot to add inflammation. That&#39;s a huge one. I feel like all that you mention modifies your cico and your hunger levels, they don&#39;t supersede them.</p>

<p>Doing cico results in me basically becoming vegetation which positively impacts the factors you suggest.</p>

<p>Do you have any quotes studies beyond saying &quot;it&#39;s complicated because of things&quot;? Show me a study where cico isn&#39;t 90% of the weight loss.</p>

<div class="md"><p>Scoring more points than your opponent does is 99% of winning any competitive game, regardless PWPL (points won, points lost) is still not worth talking about except to laugh at people who talk about PWPL like it&#39;s some meaningful revelation.</p>

<p>Player aptitude, health, plays, tool selection, past games, rules changes -- THOSE are worth talking about. PWPL -- no. Waste of time.</p>

<div class="md"><p>Not sure if you’re being serious, but every single research study from the past 10 years that has been submitted to Nature, Science, NPHR, Biomed, etc, all completely contradict CICO as a philosophy. It isn’t science, that has never been true and you have to live in an echo chamber like Reddit to believe any of it. </p>

<p>Children of obese mothers are almost universally also obese, regardless of “CICO” which for an infant is a ludicrous concept.  Rationalize that however you’d like.</p>
