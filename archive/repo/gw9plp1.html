<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Do you guys incorporate eggs to your diet and if so how many a day? Eggs to me are cheap and satiating. Could probably eat a dozen a day in between fried, scrambled, and boiled throughout the day. However, this would cut down on my meat consumption as the eggs would replace some meat as I can only eat so much until I am full. </p>

<p>Good idea or no?</p>

<div class="md"><p>Eggs are basically liquid meat.  If your body doesn&#39;t react to them, eat as many as you want.</p>
