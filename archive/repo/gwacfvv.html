<div class="md"><p>Yeah thats bs tho training ,6 hours a day is not the solution you can only train so much per day and actors always say that they trained so hard and it was so tough eating only chicken broccoli and rice. In reality most of them take hgh(human growth hormone) or an anabolic steroid to grow the mass fast. They still need to train but its just untruthful to say they reached the form through hardwork only. All the roid use in the fitness industry creates such a fake image of what people can reach &quot;natural&quot;</p>

<div class="md"><p>I do strength training 5-6 times a week trust me for a full body workout you need at most 2 hours + maybe a hour of cardio + you cant train everyday rest just as important as training. Dont get me wrong im not one of those guys who says steroids are cheating you still need tons of hard work to get to the top forms these actors are in but it is  easier steroids help you with recovery aswell as muscle growth + they make you feel like your the king of the world - the sides effects. I just dislike that its still taboo to talk about using it it would be so much safer and better overall if everyone would just be open about it.</p>

<div class="md"><p>Yeah but 6 hours of training and eating chicken and broccoli doesn&#39;t do that. I could give a shit who you are. When bodybuilders that go 2-3 hours a day for years and they don&#39;t look like an actor that is doing this for the first time getting to his godly physique in 6 months, you can&#39;t genuinely believe the actors aren&#39;t on gear, can you?</p>

<p>There&#39;s a logarithmic increase to muscle building, and it typically falls within a 20-40 set per week regimen. Hypertrophy doesn&#39;t just increase for actors because they&#39;re working super hard. They&#39;re using gear to speed it up, and while I have no issues with people using gear, it&#39;s people that believe actors&#39; stories of &quot;I worked out 6 hours a day and ate this same meal for lunch everyday even though that&#39;d fuck my micros up.&quot;</p>

<div class="md"><p>6 hours a day isn&#39;t gonna help you get jacked. 2 hours a day of propper training is extreme &amp; even then you&#39;re gonna need at least 1 rest day a week. Muscles don&#39;t grow when you work out, they grow during the recovery from a workout. There&#39;s a certain amount of stress you need to put muscles under for them to respond with growth. If you put them through way more stress than necessary it&#39;s not going to make them grow any faster. Even Dorian Yates, a really successful bodybuilder from the 90s has said 45 minutes is all you need to make good gains.</p>

<p>The real tell tale sign is how long it took to get to where he’s at now with what diet and program.</p>

<p>Shitty diet and inconsistent training? Yeah, he’s using. However, if he’s been consistent with diet and workout for 1-2 years while using I’d expect him to be much bigger.</p>

<p>If anything this is some photoshop with the proportions.</p>

<div class="md"><p>Did you just say steroids don&#39;t make it easy to grow muscle? That&#39;s literally what they do. Sure you still need to work out, but it&#39;s EASY compared to getting the same results naturally. That&#39;s why it&#39;s cheating</p>

<div class="md"><p>Most people don&#39;t understand what steroids do, so it&#39;s normal I guess.</p>

<p>It doesn&#39;t take the same &quot;effort&quot;, because you&#39;re literally getting less exhausted, you can keep going for way longer, and you also gain more muscle mass.</p>

<p>Average guy does a 1 hour workout and gains 1 hour worth of muscles.</p>

<p>Roided guy does a 5 hour workout, gains 10 hours worth of muscles in a single day, and the next day he&#39;s not even sore.</p>

<p>There&#39;s no comparison, roids are cheating yea</p>

<div class="md"><p>It doesn’t make it easier it makes it grow faster. You still have to do the same amount of work to grow or else you won’t. Most people who take gear look like shit tbh. You have to still need time under tension and muscle damage or else you will look the same and maybe be more vascular. He was extremely extremely skinny, he had muscle mass as a younger kid so gaining it back is easy once you have it. And it’s going to look dramatic because his frame was so small.

<div class="md"><p>Okay I can see that to your second point. I can tell you’re smart. Steroids also enable you to do more and recover faster. A person on steroids can withstand a greater load and demand and still recover the next day. It’s not the same amount of work, it also enables you to have a higher output. I’ve never taken anything but I have my fair knowledge of the compounds. One of the biggest attributes is recovery. But your point is fair also! And well he might not want the other adverse effects from compound use, it’s not just a free ride. But hey 🤷🏾‍♂️</p>

<p>Actually it does? The whole point of steroids is to make the muscles go full on anabolic. What might take someone a month to achieve without, would take a week with. To me thats easy. </p>

<p>Steroids help the muscles remain in an anabolic state (constantly growing/repairing), instead of periods of catabolic state (breaking down, small tears etc).</p>

<div class="md"><p>Exactly. Not to bash the dude I replied to, but most people who say things like that are probably going off of their own experience of not gaining muscle that fast due to improper nutrition and exercise. So instead if it being their fault, it must mean the other guy cheated.</p>

<p>In reality proper diet and exercise will get you very noticeable results in a matter of months. Especially if you start off really skinny (hard gainers represent!).</p>
