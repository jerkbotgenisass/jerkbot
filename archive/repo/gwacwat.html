<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I get admiring someone’s physique for a few seconds but we can sense when you’re deliberately staring and it’s really uncomfortable. Some 40 year old man comes up to me(19) today and tells me that he came up with a new squat routine for me because he just loves to watch me squat. And proceeds to complement my butt. Like who the fuck asked. No girl comes to the gym to put on a show for you guys. Thank you</p>
