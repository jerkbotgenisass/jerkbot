<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I&#39;ve been on the diet now for a 5 days and I&#39;ve been very hungry all the time. The appeal of this diet to me was that it would curve my hungry but im still always hungry. I dont know if you can over eat while on this diet or if my body will regulate itself. I try to eat three main meals and two snack meals. All meat no seasoning and full of fats. My problem is that I&#39;ve actually gained 3 pound idk water weight and im still hungry.</p>

<div class="md"><p>Don’t want to scare you, but I’ve been eating zero carb for 18 months now, and gained weight the first year or so, and it’s only coming down now. Don’t know exactly why but assume I had and have a lot of healing to do...I always simply follow my hunger but I’d be lying if I said it wasn’t discouraging and confusing at times.</p>
