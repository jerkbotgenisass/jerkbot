<p>then I tried to keep on playing sports while never having done a leg-day before the age of 21...</p>

<p>Now all I do is leg days so I can still play sports at an average level and run/sprint/change direction without getting injured.</p>

<div class="md"><p>You need more practical exercise. As a trainer it&#39;s easy for me to sit here and say jUsT wOrK iT oUt wItH gOoGlE aNd yOuToObS but honestly after a certain point people <em>really</em> hammer in movement patterns and it takes a second set of eyes. </p>

<p>I suggest seeing a PT a few times if you haven&#39;t already, and getting an idea of what limitations you have. You can then easily Google what <em>you</em> need, or they might even tell you what to focus on. </p>

<p>After you un-fuck yourself, you can get more into &#39;typical&#39; stuff. By typical, I mean fun shit you actually wanna do. Whatever your jam is, golfing, basketball, hiking, lifting, whatever. Just get and stay active the best <em>you</em> can. </p>

<p>You&#39;ll thank yourself later.</p>

<div class="md"><p>I dislike running (high impact and repetitive) for 9/10 of my clients, so unless you&#39;re limited to it for accessibility or personal reasons I just wouldn&#39;t. That being said, there&#39;s many ways you can correct your form.</p>

<p>Starting from professionals, I&#39;d consider local community colleges or high schools athletic programs, ask if maybe you can compensate someone for a small amount of time to watch your gait and give you some direction starting out.</p>

<p>A lot of the more &#39;professional&#39; or &#39;enthusiast&#39; running/shoe stores will also have sales reps very aptly suited to review your gait to get you into shoes because they themselves are usually athletes. </p>

<p>Going down a more DIY route, I&#39;d find a straight path you could video yourself running on and get some footage of you running to and from the camera. This will be able to give you a better idea of your entire kinetic chain and where exactly issues may be, as well as potentially how to address them.</p>

<p>Simply Google searching &#39;knee drift while running&#39; could net you hours of helpful resources (this may or may not be your issue). A good way to start &#39;rebalancing&#39; your joints though is going to be single-joint movements, working from bodyweight up, starting with higher reps. Think single-leg lunges or step-ups. This eliminates compensations (help from other muscle groups that shouldn&#39;t be helping) and forces you to use more muscles to balance yourself (ALL the muscles in your leg AND your core).</p>

<p>Strengthening your core, improving balance, working on breathing technique, etc. can all go into form degrading over time, so it also depends on <em>what kind</em> of running you&#39;d like to be doing. </p>

<p>There are various people that do online/remote training as well if you can&#39;t find someone locally. It&#39;s all about finding out exactly what you need and what actually works for you though. Hopefully this helped some.</p>

<div class="md"><p>I once went to a PT with wrist pain from falling a few months prior and I was wanting guidance on how to get back into using that hand.  I was 25 years old and had a bench press of 225 at the time.  I got a little pain when I did push ups and it was lingering so I had stopped working out for the past month.  I asked them, what do I do?  Wait if out?  Stretches?  Exercises?</p>

<p>Their response was that they “actually don’t like push ups or bench press for most of their patients.  Just don’t do push ups.”</p>

<p>Like, why is that even an acceptable answer?  </p>

<p>“This is your life now.” is not what I want to hear from PT.  </p>

<p>The wrist healed and I’m back to normal now, but is this normal stance from PT?  I’m happy to see you follow up your similar statement with actual advice, but telling some people to just not run is like telling some people to just not walk.  It’s an ADL!  LIFE is high impact and repetitive.</p>

<div class="md"><p>You kind of hit the nail on the head, and that&#39;s the issue I&#39;ve run into with myself. Once I hit over 275lbs on bench I started having insane wrist issues in my right wrist. I tried everything, I stopped pressing movements entirely for months while upping my forearm and grip strength routine. I tried only certain grips like bulldog, I tried variations in bench and elbow angles, straight bar vs DB, all to no effect. </p>

<p>What I do now is do as many of my sets as I can until my form starts to fail with that wrist and it starts to get sore, then I wrap. I&#39;m doing damage to myself, sure, but like you said it&#39;s my passion so it&#39;s what I accept as &#39;part of the game&#39;. </p>

<p>Ask any top tier athlete how much they care about their health, ask a hobby musician what they&#39;d do to keep their hand. It&#39;s probably the same sentiment. </p>

<p><em>All that being said</em>, you can be smart about it. I don&#39;t have many heavy pressing sets each week, sometimes I get flares up and just completely trash the workout and do some cardio, and weeks like this week I&#39;ve built up such an aggravation with my wrist that I&#39;ve had to take the entire week off because I didn&#39;t listen to my body early. </p>

<p>This is definitely my life now, I&#39;ll never have 0 wrist pain or issue of it flaring up, but that doesn&#39;t mean I have to stop what I love entirely. I just have to be smarter about it. </p>

<p>PTs are very much like other health professionals in that your mileage may vary, and that it&#39;s as much a science as it is an art for fine tuning it to each individual person. I&#39;d not stop until you find one that works, because they&#39;re out there. </p>

<p>If you&#39;re healed you may even be in a position to do sessions with a <em>trainer</em>, either remotely or in a gym. Having someone to show you the above but in a functional environment of how you workout.</p>

<div class="md"><p>Thanks for the thoughtful reply!  </p>

<p>Yeah I was just kind of taken aback when the PT basically implied that no one should be doing push-ups and that was just a fact of life.  Even if running or push ups are not good for your joints, those motions are part of the human experience.  Sure, the knees of a mall walker are probably going to hold up for longer than a marathon runner, but that doesn’t mean running should be discouraged, you know?</p>

<p>My experience with that PT made me pretty callous towards PT’s that don’t work in sports medicine as this PT just didn’t seem to understand the goals that I had in mind (get back to baseline and be able to bear weight on that wrist again) or even do a proper assessment for determining that I had a permanent injury / disability (no imaging or consulting with an ortho service, just ROM and history in the office).   I brought up that I benched quite a bit but couldn’t bear weight for push ups currently to hopefully make it clear that I was WAY below baseline health and this was an INJURY that I was looking for advice in returning to Activity with, not even aspiring to get back to big bench numbers.  She basically implied that I would never be able to do a push up again and didn’t seem to understand why I wasn’t understanding her logic.  I mean, at the time, I could do one-handed pushups so the idea of not even being able to favor the injured wrist or change form in some way to be less strenuous on the specific injury to the wrist after a period of waiting for healing didn’t make sense to me. Even if she was right about the extent of injury, which she wasn’t (wrist is back to normal now and I eventually got it properly evaluated by an orthopedic surgery office), I just don’t see how lowering a patient’s expectations is the go-to move instead of improving the injury or providing real advice for rehab.  The odd thing was this was a PT in a Big 12 University Student health center... it wasn’t like I took a geriatric PT/OT off guard and they didn’t normally see young patients or athletes.  </p>

<p>It sounds like you are completely different than that PT that I had a run in with, which is a good thing.</p>

<div class="md"><p>oh my gosh thank you so much for the in-depth comment! i’ll look into all of these things</p>

<p>i played volleyball up until college and developed some pretty uneven muscle grouping as a result. i could crouch and dive and get up repeatedly so much, but my natural motions in walking and running are kinda funky </p>

<p>i want to get into dancing (like melbourne shuffle style) as cardio, but i’ve hurt my knees so many times doing lateral stuff and my kneecaps slipping around, that i’m really afraid to</p>

<div class="md"><p>Yeah, I&#39;d highly suggest you set some money aside to see a PT because you&#39;d benefit from it immensely in my opinion. IME, former athletes tend to have more complex reasons for the issues they have, because movement patterns have really been beat in on top of whatever you may be doing in your daily routine for all these years. </p>

<p>Without being able to physically assess you, I&#39;d say I&#39;d hold off on sharp and aggressive movements like that. From the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZPaMdxC6CQI">quick search I did</a>, I&#39;d just say be precise in your movements though as your work up. You being mentally unprepared signals to me that you need a better mind muscle connection with your body again, which honestly might not even take much time. </p>

<p>We tend to fall out of practice but don&#39;t want to be honest about it, so you may just be &#39;throwing your weight around&#39; a little more than you think. Simply getting back into a regular exercise routine would boost that confidence again, but having the helping hand of a professional will usually be the extra &#39;umph&#39; that gets most people over the hurdle to actually getting back into that life pattern. </p>

<p>This isn&#39;t saying don&#39;t dance, you know your body, just be conscious of yourself and know your limits. Doing anything is better than nothing, I like to tell people to just focus on doing one more thing to work towards your goal today than you did yesterday.</p>

<div class="md"><p>A lot of PT&#39;s are obsessed with &quot;correct&quot; running style when they really shouldn&#39;t be. Even the most elite distance runners run with very lopsided strides, but manage to stay injury free. Knee injuries are a common symptom of heel landing and pronation/supination. Go find your local specialty running shop and have them fit you shoes using a gait analysis, this should stop the knee injuries. You&#39;ll also need to start working on core and hip strength to further lessen the strain on your knees.</p>

<div class="md"><p>are there any particular exercises that help keep my kneecaps contained? sometimes on lateral motions (and this is maybe once a year or less often) my kneecap will momentarily drift outward and then back, but it traumatizes the area enough to give me the heebie jeebies thinking about it</p>

<div class="md"><p>I&#39;m not a PT, but I&#39;ve found that most of the time knee injuries stem from weak hip flexors causing the knees to have to overcompensate. You can use a hip abduction machine to strengthen them, but be cautious, they&#39;ll likely be really weak. You can also do the same motion laying on your side with an exercise band if you don&#39;t have access to the machine.</p>

<p>The right shoes are often enough of a fix to stop knee injuries, definitely get a gait analysis and shoe fitting at a running store before you start again. Usually the gait analysis is free.</p>

<p>If none of that works, find a PT that is a runner, they&#39;ll have way more solutions.</p>

<div class="md"><p>Haha I appreciate the advice but I&#39;ve been seeing an athletic trainer for basically the last 2-3 years for my shoulder surgeries and knee injuries. I&#39;m at the point where I think I could borderline be one myself (/s obviously...), I have the tools and know how to prevent injuries and roll out spots that are tight and strengthen the muscles around it.</p>

<p>I&#39;m just a lazy fuck. If I had the time and energy to be doing all of the stretching, rolling out, and working out that I&#39;m supposed to be doing, it would be 2-3 hours of that every day haha.</p>

<div class="md"><p>Yes, this one random guy in the comments, who we know basically nothing about, confirms, that contrary to basically every peer reviewed scientific paper, strength training doesn&#39;t actually help prevent injury</p>

<div class="md"><p>Yeah working out your upper body really doesn&#39;t do anything but give you, for show muscles. Honestly when I used to work out nothing but upper body my arms actually felt weaker and stiffer and it was harder to do everyday activities and chores. My upper body actually feels stronger since I stopped working it out. Now I only workout lower body and core and some back and it&#39;s so much more rewarding and I don&#39;t feel top heavy. Walk or run or bike faster for longer distances, better balance, better posture, and better stamina.</p>

<div class="md"><p>Honestly, aside from correcting any issues with technique, I&#39;ve found that the rate of injury is strongly correlative to not stretching before(and after).</p>

<p>Doing a quick 10 minute set of both dynamic and static stretching is very good for your tendons and joints all around, and you&#39;re much less likely to mess up your shit. Around 2020, I neglected stretching in comparison to the 30 minutes of stretching I used to do before every session, and i seem to have managed to hurt myself in every way possible, whereas the year prior I could count the amount of times I got injured on one hand.</p>
