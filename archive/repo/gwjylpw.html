What is a totally wrong thing that has become so widespread it's not considered wrong anymore?

<div class="md"><p>Agreed. Took me a while to realise that fads don&#39;t work long term.</p>

<div class="md"><p>If I eat intuitively I binge on cheetohs because it gives me dopamine.</p>

<p>I totally agree fad diets are harmful and idiotic, and they&#39;re what contributes those statistics (although that particular 95% statistic seems like a bit of a thought-terminating clich√©. Which diets? Is that statistic for one person&#39;s total success/failiure after trying many diets, or many people trying the same diet? Does losing 50 lbs and regaining 5 constitute a &#39;failure&#39;?)  </p>

<p>I&#39;m a scientist, so tracking energy intake and expenditure (Calories in/calories out) was very helpful (have lost 40 lbs and kept it off...for going on 6 years now). For some people, calorie counting is harmful to mental health/inacessible/etc., so going about reducing energy intake another way (veggies with every meal to increase volume and lower calorie density, higher protein for satiety, etc.) works much better. The biggest thing is to pick something sustainable, and <em>change</em> your overall diet, forever, not just <em>go on</em> a diet.</p>

<p>I am very glad IE works for you, but I think the biggest thing I&#39;ve learned about diet is that there is no one-size-fits-all approach that works best for everyone. (And that juice &#39;cleanses&#39; are a load of horseshit. That too.)</p>

<div class="md"><p>I mean, your first sentence tells me that there‚Äôs still a lot about intuitive eating that you don‚Äôt understand. Because that‚Äôs a very common response from people who haven‚Äôt done much research or talked to professionals about IE. Being an eating disorder survivor who suffered from bulimia(where binging is a way of life due to the inevitable attempts at restriction and purging - exercise was my form of purging) as well as a licensed therapist that sometimes works with EDs in my practice, intuitive eating is the only way.</p>

<p>If you‚Äôre binging on Cheetos, it‚Äôs likely because you restrict them from your diet, putting your brain into ‚Äúomg, you say I can‚Äôt have this, so I want moar!!!!‚Äù mode. Additionally, the process of actually starting IE may look like binges as you give yourself full permission go eat what you like. It levels off once deprivation mindset fucks off - and that isn‚Äôt always a quick process. And it‚Äôs generally in this transition period that people freak out and reject it. Which is why working with an RD or therapist who is trained in it can be helpful in the early stages.</p>

<p>Also important to know that IE is not a method of weight control and outright rejects the idea that weight is some deeply controllable aspect of who we are. A radical concept in todays world, and a deeply contentious topic it seems, since I often get downvoted to hell for talking about it ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è</p>

<div class="md"><p>I ate whatever I wanted without any restriction and I was 40 lbs overweight. I self medicated anxiety and ADHD with food. I am well acquainted with IE, and again I am glad it has helped you, but me eating too much isn&#39;t a &#39;deprivation response&#39;, it is pleasure seeking to get dopamine for a dopamine-starved system.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t think everyone needs to be thin or athletic or eat &#39;clean&#39;/vegetarian/etc. But I&#39;ve just seen some unscientific stuff out of IE (like, somehow the law of conservation of mass/energy and all biochemistry is actually wrong). I think diet culture sucks and people should be eating for health, not thinness; but I reject the notion that I have no control over my weight, or that caring about being a healthy weight is wrong or disordered.</p>

<p>But weight is one of the most controllable aspects of your body? If calories in &gt; calories out, you gain weight. If calories in &lt; calories out, you lose weight. It&#39;s a very simple equation.</p>
