<div class="md"><p>That&#39;s because isolation exercises are not mandatory if you do The Big Moves™ at a high intensity.  They are mostly for engaging lagging muscles or just for generally directing gains there</p>

<div class="md"><p>The guys hogging the rack could benefit greatly from some isolation exercises. We’re not talking about serious weight lifters. They’re usually very young and think that Nike Vapormax sneakers are fine for squatting while they put up the most wobbly reps you’ve ever seen.</p>

<p>I know what you mean about isolation exercises, but I always add them to my routine because it contributes to larger incremental progress on the big moves, I’ve found. Plus, squatting isn’t going to contribute to calf growth that much, any more than rows do for forearms. Sure, it engages those muscles, but by such a small amount.</p>

<p>Edit: Ok. Some of you are taking this personally. Wow.</p>

<div class="md"><p>Right, but who mentioned purely aesthetics?  The person I responded to said that the lifters were hogging the squat rack and only doing squats, never mentioning aesthetics.

What are you squatting that you can say with authority that isolation work for calves is helping?</p>

<div class="md"><p>Is it though?  I objectively squat a lot and haven&#39;t ever trained calves directly.  I have trained with professional athletes and none of them trained calves in isolation.  So, its great you think calf isolation helped your squat but if you are only squatting 100 or less, literally anything will help your squat at that point.</p>

<div class="md"><p>We’re actually squatting about the same, and I can personally attest to calf exercises contributing for me and even making it easier.</p>

<p>You don’t have to take advice from me if it offends you, but I just know what it does and that calves should be worked in. It’s not just me saying it. Plenty of people benefit from it and can attest to it. Calves exist for a reason as a functional muscle, and some of us feel that strengthening it is a good thing. One reason is that it contributes to improvements squatting.</p>

<p>You won’t do it though, and that’s fine.</p>
