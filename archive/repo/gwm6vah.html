<div class="md"><p>You’re right, when I run and bike, I use my calves.  So, why do I need to train them more?  Is the 8 hours of cardio and whatever my lifting volume for the week not enough?  Why do you feel the need to isolate calves and what results have that given you?</p>

<p>Edit:  also, look at what I listed as my credentials.  What are yours?  From where I’m sitting, it’s 2 sub-3pl8 squatters talking out their ass about calves arguing with a bunch of people with massive fucking squats.  DYEL?</p>

<div class="md"><p>I mean you&#39;re working your glutes and hamstrings when you run too. Would you stop doing squats because of that? No.</p>

<p>I just don&#39;t see the disadvantage in working them. They&#39;re easy to work, quick to work, and they can only give you an advantage. Calves are important for explosive movements. Sprinting, jumping, etc. They also play a critical role in circulating your blood. It&#39;s a major muscle. Why treat them differently from any other large muscle?</p>

<p>I&#39;m definitely not the only person who feels this way. If you want to hear it from someone else, there are plenty of articles to find on google.</p>

<div class="md"><p>No. You do a calf isolation because the leg workouts a lot of people focus on don&#39;t do a good job of hitting the calves. They&#39;re frequently neglected. </p>

<div class="md"><p>It depends on the compound movement. There are definitely compound movements that work your calves. My whole point is that a lot of people aren&#39;t doing them. </p>

<p>I mean, there are tons of articles about this. Calves get neglected by a lot of people. If you&#39;re not doing a compound exercises that hits the calves then why not add an isolation exercise? I mean they are seriously easy to work. </p>

<p>Front squats don&#39;t work calves. Lunges and deadlifts aren&#39;t targeting them either. If you get anything out of those it&#39;s just ancillary. Those are probably the three most common lower body exercises</p>

<p>Edit: cannot believe how fucking stubborn some people are. You are all objectively wrong about this and it&#39;s honestly one of stupidest comment chains I&#39;ve ever seen on reddit.</p>
