<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Daniel here. 65kg, current deadlift 5RM 145kg. Holding on to the weight has stated to become the limiting factor for me. I have normal straps, as well as the figure 8 ones. I like to pull the slack out of the bar between reps, and, with straps on, I can&#39;t seem to get the correct starting position. I feel like I&#39;m bent over a lot more than I should be. Any help, tips are much appreciated. 
I pull sumo by the way. For form videos, feel free to check my profile.</p>

<div class="md"><p>Don’t use lifting straps. You’re body gets strong as a unit. When you isolate a muscle you isolate a tendon, ligament, an entire joint. Nature engineers things to fail at a week point to save an essential component. For example you’re grip giving out before you destroy ur back.</p>
