How long after starting keto until weightlifting power starts to come back? (specifically with powerlifting)

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p><strong><em>Context</em></strong></p>

<p>Sex: Male</p>

<p>Weight: 185lb</p>

<p>BF%: roughly 15%</p>

<p>Height: 6&#39;1&quot;</p>

<p>Age: 25</p>

<p>Training: powerlifting + slow endurance running once a week</p>

<p>&#x200B;</p>

<p>Time spent on keto: on and off for the past 3 months. I don&#39;t get keto flu going in and out of keto and I can enter ketosis within the same day of starting. This is because of 8 months of strict consistent full keto that I did last year, which made me very fat adapted.</p>

<p>However, I was not doing powerlifting at the time, just regular weight training. I was training for hypertrophy and looks. Now I train for strength and competition (I want to start competing). I started powerlifting fairly recently, and wow, it feels so hard to do without carbs. The only time its bearable is when I&#39;m going TKD. </p>

<p>Problem with TKD is that as long as I keep carbs present (40g-90g an hour before powerlifting sessions) my junk-food cravings don&#39;t go away. Sure, I still get the general reduction in appetite from being in ketosis, but I&#39;ll still have impulse control issues if I&#39;m near my weaknesses (oreos, poptarts, sandwiches, cheesecake (especially red velvet ‚ò∫Ô∏èüíï)).</p>

<p>When I did strict consistent keto last year, my desire for junkfood left me at about the 3 month mark. After that I could literally be at a family party surrounded by my weaknesses and think &quot;meh I&#39;ll pass. I&#39;ll just have more chicken and roast hehe&quot;.</p>

<p>Anyway, because of this I want to go back to full keto instead of TKD, but I don&#39;t want my powerlifting sessions to suffer as badly as they&#39;ve been suffering.</p>

<p>&#x200B;</p>

<p>Anyone here who does powerlifting, or just lifts heavy in general? Can you tell me if the initial hit in power-output goes away after a few weeks?</p>

<p>&#x200B;</p>

<p><strong><em>Standard session stats for reference</em></strong></p>

<p>Bench: 185, 4 sets 3 reps</p>

<p>Deadlift: 325 4 sets 4 reps</p>

<p>Squat: 285 4 sets 4 reps</p>

<div class="md"><p>A lot of the power you had wasn‚Äôt real, and was from glycogen/carbs, not from actual muscle. Once you eat carbs again you‚Äôll add all that back, plus the muscle you‚Äôve been adding on with just keto.</p>
