<div class="md"><p>Upper: Bench Press 3x6 (immediately after do band flies) Incline push-ups 2x20 Lat pull downs (then underhand till failure) 3x8 Shoulder press and 21s 3x8 Hammer/reg curl switches 3x10 Tricep pushdowns 2x10</p>

<p>I do this 2 times a week. I did Jason blahas 5x5 program for 5 months before I did this. I do legs 3 days because Iâ€™m an athlete. Any changes, additions, subtractions, or feedback would be appreciated. Ask any questions you want. I&#39;m not a newbie, I have been working out for 2 years and really have the form and musle memory down for lots of exercises.</p>
