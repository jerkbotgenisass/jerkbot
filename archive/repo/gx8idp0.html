<div class="md"><p>It’s a strange thing for sure. At 30 I still felt like I could do anything I could when I was 20, a few years, a few pounds, and a kid later (35 now, age not kids) and I feel like I wouldn’t be able to do half the stuff I did back then. Used to be able to do backflips off fences, running front flips, hop a fence like this no problem at all. Think I’d break something if I tried any of that now.</p>

It&#39;s a lot easier to put on muscle as you get older, and as long as you don&#39;t drive everywhere and hate exercise you won&#39;t lose athletic ability.</p>

<div class="md"><p>What a load of shit. If you actually take care of your body you&#39;re going to look back at what you could do at 18 as if it were the prime of your life. I can lift way more and run way longer than I could a decade ago.</p>

<div class="md"><p>28, so unless I start deteriorating like absolute crazy in the next 14 months, which is highly unlikely as I&#39;m still getting stronger and fitter, I will not feel like shit at 30.</p>

<div class="md"><p>Then I don&#39;t understand why you are arguing my point that people, are physically fitter below the age of 30.</p>

<div class="md"><p>Because it&#39;s not true for actually fit people. And because you weren&#39;t saying people in general are fitter below 30, you assumed that the poster was young because they said 30 is not that old when you have no clue why he or she said that and they could very well be actually fit at 30.</p>

<div class="md"><p>This discussion is becoming pointless. We both made our points. Ofcourse most people are more atheltic in below 30, I give you that. </p>

<p>I hope you have a nice day.</p>
