<div class="md"><p>I never achieved to weight myself after pooping in the morning without eating anything, only after taking a pee. I always need to eat my morning meal (618 calories) and drink plenty of water in order to take a shit. I keep track of my weight after peeing in the morning since i can take a shit only after eating. Is it wrong to track weight like this?</p>

<p>Should i weight myself after i pee then eat and take a shit in a bucket and weight the poop in the bucket and remove that weight from the morning measurement? (the weight before eating but only peeing)</p>
