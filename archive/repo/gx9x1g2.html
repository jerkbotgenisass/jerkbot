<div class="md"><p>That person is parading around as &quot;Dr. Helene&quot; but when you search his he comes up as an &quot;ND&quot; which is a naturopath doctor... literally a fucking essential oils conman.</p>

<p>How is it legal to parade yourself as a doctor when you aren&#39;t actually a doctor?</p>

<div class="md"><p>If he put Dr. Helene M.D. it becomes the issue. But I can go around and call myseld Dr. Fresh and give lectures on whatever I want. The line gets crossed when these guys start giving medical advice like dont vaccinate, dont get chemo but instead use this crystal and rub urine in your eyes. The fact they can hide behind the fact that what they say isnt incorrect (technically there ARE harmful chemicals in vaccines, but due to lots of different factors like the overall mix, actual amounts etc. They are not actually harmful but i digress) and that they arent giving medical advice (they are but they get to say: well I didnt tell them not to, i said look at these rare side effects and suggested a natural supplement jnstead but told them decisions should be made in conjuction with a doctor..  like god damn. We set the rules up to allow the snake oil salesman to get rich.</p>

<div class="md"><p>Right they don&#39;t say the X in the vaccine will harm you. </p>

<p>They say &quot;The vaccine, look at it sometime it&#39;s right on the box, the vaccine contains X. Do you know what X is? No? It&#39;s a component of many industrial lubricants. It&#39;s ALSO capable of forming toxic compounds that can kill an adult elephant, or cause some people to go into anaphylactic shock. Do you want THAT in your body? In your kids bodies?&quot;</p>

<p>Note they never say that the way it&#39;s used in the vaccine will do that.</p>

<p>Plus the way I worded it, X could be hydrogen.</p>

<div class="md"><p>You can call yourself a doctor, just so long as you don&#39;t practice medicine without a license.  Dr. Dre has repeatedly avoided jail by refusing to perform surgery, even when people begged.</p>

<div class="md"><p>You can&#39;t fix gullible.  Just so long as the person doesn&#39;t practice medicine and doesn&#39;t make verifiably false claims that the FDA or other relevant agencies can nail them for, they&#39;re likely legal.  Just sketchy as hell and deserve to be  beaten with bamboo rods.</p>

<div class="md"><p>It depends on where they live. I know in most of the south and midwest they&#39;re not granted any kind of licensing and it&#39;s illegal for them to use the title Dr. in a medical context or lead people to believe they&#39;re physicians. Other states and some Canadian provinces regulate them to varying extents, and some (like Alaska, last I knew) allow them a certain scope of practice but prohibit them from calling themselves doctors.</p>

<div class="md"><p>Naturopathy isn&#39;t snake oil, actually. It respects that nature is an interconnected, interrelated system with billions of years of evolution. So much of alternative medicine is just slandered by the medical industrial complex, Karens, hippies, and pseudoskeptics. They misinform people and negatively brand it.</p>

<p>Functional medicine, for example, uses systems biology and root cause analysis and takes a more individualized approach to treatment than a one-size-fits-all approach, yet it&#39;s slandered as pseudoscience, because it&#39;s less profitable for corporations, it makes doctors and researchers question their subjective worldview and career, and pseudoskeptics are very biased about it.</p>

<p>Bioenergetics is a legitimate field by the way, though I think she meant bioelectromagnetics, and the person is correct to an extent about germs and viruses. Our species has co-evolved with many germs, hence the human microbiome which includes more than the gut microbiome. It&#39;s part of our immune system. Socializing can also boost immunity via oxytocin. Vaccines are worth getting, though.</p>
