<div class="md"><p>Man, every time I see this, I am reminded of how all realities are, well, relative. Your body looks fantastic in the second photo, and it breaks my heart to know that you couldn’t see that for so long. I’ve got a bit of body dysmorphia in the opposite direction. I have an incredibly fast metabolism that doesn’t allow me to keep on body mass (I am a guy). Obviously, society treats us differently based on our genders, but if I had a dime for every time a family member told me I was “too skinny” or “scrawny” or whatever I’d be a millionaire. I’m like “Bitch, I consume about 5000 calories a day and don’t retain fat! I can’t ‘eat more’ aunt Karen!”</p>
