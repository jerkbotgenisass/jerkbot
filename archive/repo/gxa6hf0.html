<div class="md"><p>You overload and apply stimulus to muscle fibers to have them grow larger, depending on the type of lift it can impact slow and fast twitch fibers. </p>

<p>Stretching a muscle beyond a normal range while under extreme resistance in addition to the stress the spine and joints can experience due to the pressure from weight can cause injury.</p>

<div class="md"><p>Something tells me this isn&#39;t anywhere close to him maxing out. </p>

<p>Injury happens with overexertion and bad form. Neither of which this dude is doing. </p>

<p>If you&#39;re gonna say he&#39;s rounding his back, then you&#39;re not up-to-date with the literature regarding lumbar support.</p>

<p>Stop diminishing other people&#39;s success based on outdated information and insecurity.</p>

<div class="md"><p>Your projecting guesses and extremely defensive there’s no having a constructive discussion, not sure if you cup this dudes balls or what.</p>

<p>Didn’t say anything about rounding his back as usually there must be some rounding or it’s unnatural for the spine unless your extremely flexible. </p>

<p>You also don’t have to be maxing out to put yourself at risk for injury, never said that.</p>

<p>Injury happens for far more than the two oversimplified reasons you listed, he easily could have pulled a muscle when the bar rolled on his leg as the “knee jerk” reaction to grab it and pull back could pull a muscle.</p>

<p>Not sure what you have to prove on Reddit but not sure what success your worried about being diminished, if he lifts to record and upload and not to challenge himself that’s not my problem, you open yourself to criticism the second you share online. </p>

<p>As far as insecurity goes I’m a 34 year old man that can probably standard deadlift only 330lbs or so, I don’t really care what anyone else can lift, and where I’m at in life, I’m focused on longevity so I can be active when I’m old. </p>

<p>I wouldn’t do those types of lifts with any weight because I don’t think doing a deadlift by grabbing the plates is an intelligent thing to do. </p>

<p>I would also say in general, that you seem very insecure as you are inventing arguments in your posts not related to what was said</p>
