<div class="md"><p>Well it depends. Muscle strength is high weight. That is where you do as many reps as you can, with a weight around 75% of what you can lift once and once only (1 rep max or 1RM). This doesn&#39;t necessarily make your muscles bigger, but stronger.
Muscle endurance is when you use smaller weights. 20 or more reps each set with something about half of your 1RM. You do this to increase your muscles oxygen uptake.
Muscle size is the midpoint, where you lift something about 60% of your 1RM, 8-12 times. If you can&#39;t reach 8, you&#39;re at too high of a weight, and if you can get above 12, you&#39;re using too light of a weight.
If you&#39;re just trying to lose weight, cardio is very important, but weightlifting also seems to be useful. In that situation, all of them seem to have the same effect, so shake it up, and then when you&#39;ve reached your ideal  body type (not weight because you might be gaining muscle, which is heavier than fat), switch the technique to do whatever it is you decide is right for you.</p>

<div class="md"><p>I used to manage a bunch of fitness clubs, and I completely agree with what <a href="/u/Frenchymemez">/u/Frenchymemez</a> said, and would also like to add that a healthy diet and rest is also necessary along with the exercise</p>

<p>Ideally you want to have 6 small meals a day, around 3 hrs apart, with a strict healthy diet for 6 days and 1 cheat day where you can eat anything you want. That helps the body understand that there is always enough food coming in, and on a set time, and the cheat day helps you maintain the lifestyle change (always think of it as a lifestyle change instead of a diet, easier to maintain it that way). More protein to gain weight, more carbs to lose weight, keep healthy fats moderate (not too low or high). </p>

<p>And you want to push to muscle failure, not muscle injury and allow enough rest in between to recover. And drink lots of water! Hope that helped</p>

<div class="md"><p>Yes, water is vital. Last week I went to the gym without my water bottle, and did way less than normal. And diet is very important, I just don&#39;t know much about the various benefits of dieting in all honesty, so I figured I&#39;d leave that out</p>

<div class="md"><p>There&#39;s no evidence smaller meals spread out is beneficial, <a href="/r/intermittentfasting">/r/intermittentfasting</a> swears by their approach. </p>

<p>The ultimate key is fewer calories, the IF approach for many works better than tiny meals that leaves you hungry at all times.</p>
