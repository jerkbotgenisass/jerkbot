<div class="md"><p>&lt;serious&gt; You should start any workout program with high reps, low weights, and work through to lower reps, higher weights. Periodization is a critical part of adaptation. Broadly speaking, each phase of a workout plan should be 6-8 weeks, and then changed. Also, the <em>way</em> you lift is every bit as important as how many and how much, and not just to avoid injury; if you&#39;re benching, you&#39;ll get the best results by going up on a two-count, pause, and down on a three count. You&#39;re doing more work on the elongation phase than the contraction phase.</p>

<div class="md"><p>I’m a body builder and I support this comment. </p>

<p>Also, touching on form and proper form.. using proper form will not only save you from injury, but it’ll build muscle faster. It also make shows you how strong a muscle group really is. I see tons of guys doing basic barbell curls, curling 70-90lbs, but they’re using their entire body to curl it. Throwing their momentum back, pushing with their legs, using their shoulders.. all to do a barbell curl. </p>

<p>Do it properly, elbow tights, no movement aside from the arms, and you’ll be humbled very quickly. Those guys throwing back 90lbs struggle after a few reps at 30-50lbs once proper form is introduced. They also will now build biceps faster by actually focusing on them.</p>

<p>No you&#39;re not. I don&#39;t mean to come off as a cunt but seriously, <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Brogress/comments/k2x5dw/m3360_301lbs_to_160lbs_10_months/?utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_source=share">this is you</a>. You are in no way eligible to be presenting yourself as an authority of any kind on training. Your advice is just plain bad as well, I&#39;m just going to link this text and leave it at that. <a href="http://mythicalstrength.blogspot.com/2014/01/form-is-overrated.html?m=1">http://mythicalstrength.blogspot.com/2014/01/form-is-overrated.html?m=1</a></p>

<div class="md"><p>I appreciate your judgement, but I’ve been professionally training for 6 months and enter my first competition in July at the 205 bronze division. </p>

<p>Absolutely nothing said in my comment is false and unless you feel personally attacked by my mention of poor form, then I’m not sure what you’re all pissy about.</p>

<p>Linking some homemade blog about form doesn’t disprove all of the science and studies that have been done.</p>

<p>This doesn&#39;t mean anything, you haven&#39;t competed yet, much less earned your pro card.</p>
