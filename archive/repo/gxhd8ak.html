<div class="md"><p>Funny how you couldn&#39;t address anything I said about his form and injury risk. And there&#39;s nothing wrong with the occasional strength feat in the gym. It gives you a goal and breaks up monotony.</p>

<div class="md"><p>Funny how you can&#39;t back a single thing you said with real substantial evidence. Things said without proof can be dismissed without proof. Hella documentation about form and injury correlation. Sooo, be dumb elsewhere?</p>

<div class="md"><p>Have you actually spent any significant time strength training or are you talking from a position of relative to complete ignorance?</p>

<p>Firstly, you&#39;re not going to find much research on the &quot;correct technique&quot; for this collection of movements, I&#39;m just applying my +20 years of lifting experience and knowledge in that case. </p>

<p>And as for  the discussion of form and injury, &quot;perfect&quot; or even &quot;good&quot; form are largely undefinable terms due to the significant range of variation in exercise form caused by individual differences. One person&#39;s &quot;acceptable form&quot; will vary significantly from another&#39;s. Furthermore, the more experienced a lifter is, the generally better conditioned they are to handle a greater variation in form under heavy loads. Hence, &quot;bad form&quot; is nearly as undefinable, and what many less knowledgeable and experienced people believe is &quot;bad form&quot; is actually within the lifter&#39;s acceptable range. There is some supporting statistical evidence for this as well but I just can&#39;t be bothered to find it tonight.</p>

<p>And that all said, what exactly are you insinuating is bad form here? Because it all seems pretty safe to me considering how experienced he must be as a lifter and how easily he manhandles the weight.</p>

<div class="md"><p>It&#39;s 500lbs and he almost lost it on his lap... What video are you watching? Sure his back is sollid, but to put that bar across your tendons in your elbow is asinine. And the reason you don&#39;t find articles on the &quot;correct way to do this&quot; is because it is not an exercise that is safe and is 100% for showing off. Jesus. I actually went to school to study human biology. I know quite a bit about this as well and you vehemently downvoting and spam commenting on people criticizing this dude for showing off is childish. Sorry your feelings are hurt because you think showing off is actually exercising. Sure, experience makes this &quot;safer&quot; than in the hands of a novice. However, safe? No. Not at all. And stupid. Literally explain to me the difference in gains between this and a normal fucking squat? I&#39;ll wait.</p>
