<div class="md"><p>How aggressively should I bulk? </p>

<p>What kind of weight gain is reasonable? I don’t want to go on some crazy stupid bulk and have like 90% of my weight gain being fat. </p>

<p>I was thinking of doing 1kg per month. Is this too slow? Too fast? Just outright dumb?</p>

<div class="md"><p>To me I think the scale is a bad way to track bulking personally while its a useful metric I would rather use my strength because to me strength = muscle.  How you go about measuring that well that kind of depends, if you&#39;re bulking you surely need to increase your strength(muscle) faster than if you are maintaining or cutting.  The issue with weight is it tracks elements that change frequently daily 3 elements that change Fat/Water/Muscle there is more that changes but these three will affect the scale more</p>

<div class="md"><p>A scale is exactly the way you should track bulking because if you are gaining 2lbs/week, you aren’t getting appreciably more muscle than 1lb/week but you are adding 1 extra pound of fat/week.</p>

<p>You get rid of daily fluctuations by tracking an average over time and making small adjustments.</p>

<div class="md"><p>whatever pace you want, really. 1-2kg per month is pretty standard. you can err closer to 2kg without much issue as a beginner.</p>

<p>If you&#39;re training with good consistency and intensity, you should pretty much never reach a point where 90% of your weight gain is fat, even on a more aggressive bulk.</p>

<div class="md"><p>Typical advice is from 0.25% bodyweight/week on the low end to 0.5% bodyweight/week on the high end. Typically beginners and people who are very small would be recommended to go on the high end.</p>
