Mild tendonitis: can it be fixed by just deloading?

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>My bench was lacking a lot so I started to bench 4 times a week. Now my bench is finally catching up and I turned my max into my working set. I did develop mild tendonitis in my wrist though. I don&#39;t think it is a form problem, probably just a overload problem. </p>

<p>Internet says I should not use the tendon for a few days. I however want to keep benching; I am making nice progress. Should I deload, stop completely, or finish my program because fuck it? It is very mild I don&#39;t mind it at all to be honest, I just want to prevent it becoming a problem. And to be honest, I kinda wanna just say fuck it and keep benching.</p>

<div class="md"><p>You most likely have a bad muscle connection and bad form. The most common way to get tendonitis is bad form. Also, it takes 3-5 days for a muscle to fully repair and you are doing this 4 times a week.</p>

<p>Along with this, the flat bar bench press is nothing more than an ego exercise as there are plenty of ways to grow your chest that are more efficient and not as bad for your body.</p>

<p>So, not really.</p>

<p>Tendinitis isn&#39;t really a term that&#39;s used anymore as it&#39;s not very prevalent. When we take samples of tendons which are experiencing tendinopathy, there&#39;s only a ~1.5x increase in inflammatory mediators (cytokines) yet we define inflammatory diseases has having a 1000-10000x increase. </p>

<p>Tendinopathy is usually a result of impropr load management i.e. tendon stress can no longer meet healing demands. Effects of certain medications such as cortico/anabolic steroids or certain antibiotics or as a result of under-loading.</p>

<p>Entirely depends on the programming is set up. I&#39;ve been training my back 4 or 5 days in a row for the past 3 years.</p>

<p>Please show evidence that the bench press is uniquely injurious compared to other movements.</p>

<p>Edit: we can hardly define what constitutes &quot;bad form&quot; versus &quot;good form&quot; when it comes to injury.. so I don&#39;t see how you can be so confident in stating that when one of the largest predictors of injury is load management, not how we move.</p>

<div class="md"><p>Sure.</p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>These things don&#39;t really matter for tendonitis.</p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>No. It&#39;s caused by overuse, because muscles adapt faster than joints. Not because of bad form.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Also, it takes 3-5 days for a muscle to fully repair and you are doing this 4 times a week.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>You don&#39;t have to wait for a muscle to be fully repaired to train it again. In fact, for increasing the bench it&#39;s often recommended that people bench more often because it lets you practice technique more often. On a personal note, I squatted 5 days a week for a few weeks with 0 issues.</p>

<p>Any exercise can be an ego exercise, absolutely pointless comment. And flat bench is pretty efficient for growing the chest. As for the &quot;bad for your body&quot; thats just a bunch of bollocks.</p>

<p>You&#39;ve literally stated wrong things with every sentence. Come on</p>
