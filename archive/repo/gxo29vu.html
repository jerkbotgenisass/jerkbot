<div class="md"><p>What&#39;s the current scientific thought on how much red meat is ok per day? I know there&#39;s not a specific answer and it varies per person, but researching this just brings up threads that are 4-9 years old, or very vague such as &quot;in moderation&quot; or &quot;increased red meat intake.&quot; Is red meat like sodium from a few years ago where it used to be thought of as very bad but now isn&#39;t so much of a concern for the normal, typical (healthy) person? Right now I&#39;m eating around 340 g of ground beef (96/4) a day.</p>

<p>Thanks!</p>

<div class="md"><p>If you want some good data from more recently, check out some of the leading carnivore diet guys, Paul Saladino for example. Most of the diet consists of red meat, Saladino for example says he has a 500+ LDL (bad) cholesterol, and yet has 0 arterial plaque buildup. It appears based on what I&#39;ve seen that the risks associated with red meat strongly correlate to metabolic health.</p>

<p>It&#39;s no wonder the data looks like red meat is bad when most people who eat it (and most people in general) are overweight, obese, or otherwise metabolically unhealthy. It&#39;s a confounding variable there that isn&#39;t addressed in the lipid hypothesis. </p>

<p><a href="https://imgur.com/MnNuLCj.jpg">https://imgur.com/MnNuLCj.jpg</a></p>

<p>Here is an example. The first graph people look at and say yeah, clearly LDL cholesterol causes cardiovascular disease. The second graph is the exact same data stratified by another variable, HDL cholesterol which is used as a proxy for metabolic health</p>

<p>It would appear that those with healthy metabolism experience almost negligible increase in disease risk from raised LDL (which is the whole idea behind red meat being bad)</p>

<p>Much like salt, I don&#39;t think it&#39;s as black and white as the industry has painted it to be. It could be &quot;bad&quot; for one person and perfectly fine for another</p>

<div class="md"><p>Sure, why not?</p>

<p>1) Scurvy. First thing off the top of my head. Meat doesn&#39;t have enough vitamin C in it which is why all the deckhands in the previous millennia got it before they started sucking on lemons. </p>

<p>2) Where is the fiber? Fiber is the best correlating factor to have a health GI system. It&#39;s what likely has the largest impact on having a &quot;healthy&quot; microbiome, whatever that means. More tangibly it&#39;s what keeps bowels regular and ameliorates GI distress/constipation.</p>

<p>3) Sodium is correlated well with hypertension, which is strongly correlated with increased all cause mortality. Meats, especially processed, have significant sodium in them so as to blunt microbial growth. A water activity level below 0.85 is usually the cutoff for attenuation of pathologic microbial growth.</p>

<p>4) <a href="https://www.health.harvard.edu/staying-healthy/whats-the-beef-with-red-meat">There&#39;s been quite</a> a lot of <a href="https://www.health.harvard.edu/staying-healthy/can-you-explain-the-red-meat-debate">consensus from the top</a> nutrition experts in the world <a href="https://www.health.harvard.edu/staying-healthy/harvard-researchers-red-meat-consumption-tied-to-early-death">to eat red meat in moderation</a>. </p>

<p>5) <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DASH_diet#Study_results">The DASH diet</a>, which is one of the healthiest diets by most health experts recommends a miserly intake of meat, instead focusing on fruits, vegetables, complex carbohydrates, and unsaturated fats. <a href="https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/nejm199704173361601">In a landmark trial the DASH diet was shown to significantly reduce blood pressure</a>. </p>

<p>6) From Wikipedia because now I&#39;m starting to care less:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Proponents of plant-free diets proclaim various health benefits  including; weight loss, reduced fatigue, betterments in cognition &amp;  mood, improved digestion, increased insulin sensitivity and even  protection from autoimmune conditions.

<p>There is no <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evidence-based_medicine">clinical evidence</a> that the carnivore diet is safe or provides any health benefits and the diet has attracted criticism from <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physician">physicians</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nutritionist">nutritionists</a> as being potentially dangerous to health.<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monotrophic_diet#cite_note-hamblin-8">[8]</a><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monotrophic_diet#cite_note-Independent-6">[6]</a><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monotrophic_diet#cite_note-sutton-14">[14]</a> Medical experts have warned that the diet can cause <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vitamin_deficiency">vitamin deficiencies</a> and followers run the risk of raising their <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Low-density_lipoprotein">LDL cholesterol</a>, which can increase the risk of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cardiovascular_disease">cardiovascular disease</a>.<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monotrophic_diet#cite_note-Independent-6">[6]</a><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monotrophic_diet#cite_note-McGill-7">[7]</a> Critics have also hypothesized long term adherence could increase one’s risk of developing certain cancers, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-alcoholic_fatty_liver_disease">non-alcoholic fatty liver disease</a>, complications from <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chronic_kidney_disease">chronic kidney disease</a>, eating disorders and other psychological issues.<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monotrophic_diet#cite_note-:0-12">[12]</a> </p>

<p>Yeah, I think that sums it up enough.</p>

<div class="md"><p><a href="https://www.hsph.harvard.edu/nutritionsource/what-should-you-eat/protein/">When you ask the nutritionists with PhD&#39;s in the field they will tell you to try to eat red meat in moderation</a>. It appears that there are correlations between red meat and significant disease. Now, is that because of the meat or the processing? It&#39;s hard to say at the moment. </p>

<p>Keep in mind, the trends for incidence of individuals eating red meat getting cancer versus someone who smokes a pack of cigarettes per day, we are talking about a ~2500% difference. Also, when one controls for vegetable intake with many of the protein studies, as well as SES status, activity level, family history, and whether the red meat is processed versus unprocessed, the correlations become significantly weaker.</p>

<p>Is red meat healthy for you? I honestly don&#39;t care. Have you eaten your fiber today is a much better question.</p>

<p>For every 10g of fiber between 0-30g per day your chances of dying from heart attack or stroke decrease by 10%. Also, GI cancer rates drop quite well.</p>

<div class="md"><p>Thank you, I&#39;ll research the link and see what it says and see if they try to define &quot;moderation&quot; at all. </p>

<p>Side note, is all fiber (or at least most) created equal? I&#39;m getting around 62g a day from a combination of oats, tortillas, black beans, potatoes, and bran.</p>

<div class="md"><p>No, not all fiber is. It appears that the most important source is from vegetables, although almost any amount of fiber is good. It&#39;s only of the few things I can think of that does not have a described upper limit.</p>

<div class="md"><p>There&#39;s soluble and insoluble fiber, as long as you don&#39;t get exclusively 60g of one or the other it&#39;s fine. The combi you mention seems fine.</p>
