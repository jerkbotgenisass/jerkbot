<div class="md"><p>Probably going to be a weak jerk. I&#39;m kind of bored and don&#39;t want to study anymore. So, here we are. The SBS guys were talking about the journal article that came out saying that red meat was not bad for you, and one of the links I provided I think they talked about being one of the major rebuttals to that article. </p>

<p>I had a patient&#39;s Dad TODAY tell me how he stopped eating a heavy red meat diet/fast food diet, and went from having GI problems all the time to now he feels great. Why is it so hard to eat vegetables with some of these people?</p>

<div class="md"><p>Gotta keep that Fakebook PhD fresh!</p>

<p>When I looked at his comment history there was a significant amount of <a href="/r/steroids">/r/steroids</a> comments and many poor attempts at giving dietary advice in the dailies; but I gotta give homie credit for having nice shoulders. I heard Purple had nice arms. You probably donâ€™t know who Purple is, a little before your time, mate ;)</p>

<div class="md"><p>Thanks actually about the shoulders, I&#39;m curious what diet advice you got. And also don&#39;t exaggerate my <a href="/r/steroids">r/steroids</a> comments lol it&#39;s less than 10 for sure come on I just started over there</p>

<p>Also I never advocated the carnivore diet just putting that out there. I mentioned red meat effects on lipids and brought up the carnivore diet because that&#39;s a pretty notable community to look at for data on red meat consumption</p>
