<div class="md"><p>This might sound ludicrous, but what if she knows what she’s doing?</p>

<p>It’s unlikely because she is a woman, but maybe considering she had enough experience to smoothly hip thrust 400+lbs she not only knows what she’s doing but what she’s trying to accomplish.</p>

<p>I’m just throwing this out there, I mean it’s probably just a coincidence that she had this impressive lift.</p>

<div class="md"><p>You make a good point but it is objectively wrong.

<div class="md"><p>How doesn’t it make sense? just because you don’t know how things work doesn’t mean that they don’t work.</p>

<p>Only people that don’t actually lift think that “form” and rom are more important than the weight lifted to feel superior without doing any work </p>

<p>Partial reps are literally done by almost everybody that trains at a high level because they work to achieve a specific goal, bodybuilders do half reps for constant tension, powerlifters do block pulls, rack pulls, block bench, spoto presses, etc..., Olympic weightlifters do partial movements, arm wrestlers do half curls, etc....</p>

<div class="md"><p>Honestly rack pulls are mostly gonna be shit for fixing your dead. If you&#39;re missing at lockout it&#39;s because your start position is bad. I had to completely change my setup to get from 6 to 700 because every lockout was shit. Just from purposely rounding my shoulders to cut rom. Worked till it didn&#39;t.</p>

<div class="md"><p>Please don&#39;t misunderstand me. I am not saying that partial range of motion exercises can&#39;t help. I love rack pulls. In that specific exercise, the primary purpose of the exercise is lost by not completing the movement. There is a difference between a movement like rack pulls which is a partial range of motion exercise and an exercise like this that isn&#39;t brought to completion.   It would be like only doing 60% of the rack pull and not coming all the way up and that is my point.</p>

<div class="md"><p>No that is ok. Any person who has been in a gym long enough will tell you to be very careful with heavy weights because injuries are easy to come by. Especially when you cross the 4 plate threshold.   </p>

<p>There are only a handful of exercises you would do partial reps for. The Rack Pull is an example of being a dedicated movement for the upper part of the dead lift. It is never appropriate to do partial reps unless you are doing a specific exercise like rack pulls since much of the purpose of the exercise is lost in doing so.   </p>

<p>If you were doing partial reps, it should be with light weight to help familiarity in the movement and build control. I, for example, will do partial reps on a squat before going all the way down to ensure I am familiar with the weight. I am not doing partial reps for exercise though.</p>
