<div class="md"><p>Assisted pull ups query. Actually back exercises in general.</p>

<p>Are you supposed to feel your back while doing them? Because I didn’t at all. Lowered weight on pull downs and seated rows but didn’t feel it at all.</p>

<div class="md"><p>Feeling an exercise is not required at all.  If you are doing an exercise that targets a muscle group, that group is being hit.  People complain about not “feeling” chest during bench as an example, but you literally can not bench without your chest.</p>

<div class="md"><p>It amazes me how many parrots on this sub still say MMC doesn&#39;t matter at all.  If you never feel a MMC on any of your exercises and you aren&#39;t a beginner with less than 6 months of training, you&#39;re doing something wrong.</p>

<div class="md"><p>Hi there.  I never feel a MMC with any muscle ever and beyond people mentioning this on this sub, I’ve never once thought about MMC ever.  I know many of the MVPs and people with absurd lifts are the same.  So, with that being the case, are you arguing we are wrong and are results do not speak for themselves?  Are we doing something wrong?</p>

<p>Or, is the more likely scenario that mmc is overblown and likely has little effect in the long term outcomes of someone’s training?</p>

<div class="md"><p>If your mind isn&#39;t connected to your muscle, then you&#39;ve got some serious issues with your nervous system.</p>

<p>Any scientific evidence that there&#39;s such a phenomenon as &#39;Mind Muscle Connection&#39;?</p>

<div class="md"><p>What are you talking about? If someone tells me when they do bicep curls they only feel it in their shoulders and forearms I&#39;m not going going to go &quot;well it&#39;s a bicep curl so it must be working your bicep&quot;, I&#39;m going to try to help them engage their bicep more.</p>

<p>Now if you are just doing an exercise to get stronger at the exercise, it doesn&#39;t really matter where you feel it. But if you want to do an exercise to target a specific muscle it&#39;s probably a good idea that you feel that specific muscle working.</p>

<div class="md"><p>But how can you get a curl up if the bicep isn&#39;t working?</p>

<p>Again, do you have any scientific evidence of this phenomenon even existing, let alone having a large effect on training?</p>

<div class="md"><p>The muscle does not care what you feel; performing a movement will engage the relevant muscles either way.</p>

<p>If someone legitimately didn&#39;t have a mind-muscle connection and lifted for years with no growth when everything else was accounted for, that&#39;s a medical condition.</p>

<div class="md"><p>If you&#39;re engaging the target muscles you will likely be feeling a MMC.  Every science based person in the lifting industry agrees that MMC has it&#39;s place and should not be ignored.</p>

<div class="md"><p>you can bench with your triceps and shoulders handling most of the weight though, and end up with underdeveloped pectorals. Form/&quot;feeling&quot; the muscle does matter.</p>

<div class="md"><p>Yes, if you use an extremely close grip. That&#39;s not &#39;feeling&#39;, that&#39;s entirely form, the <em>former</em> thing you mentioned :p</p>

<div class="md"><p>That sounds like a problem with form, not a muscle connection.</p>
