Thoughts on Creatine when Cutting?

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Hey guys, I&#39;m on a heavy cardo-based exercise routine with gym sessions about 3 times a week and running / soccer games 3 times a week. My body seems more achy these days even as I&#39;ve progressed into the 3rd week of this routine, so I was thinking about taking Creatine to help boost my energy levels and further my cut. Do you guys think this is worthwhile? I guess I was curious if creatine had any benefit on cut and/or non-lifting / gym sessions? Thanks!</p>

<div class="md"><p>I&#39;m abundantly aware of the mechanisms behind ATP synthesis in response to creatine. Please provide a source for superior efficacy of 20 grams versus 10 or even 5 grams. Because anything more than maximum saturation is just extra load on the kidneys to filter out. You made an un-substantiated claim. Please support with a citation, rather than simple anecdote. I&#39;ll wait.</p>

<div class="md"><p>And prove to me that maximum saturation occurs at 10g per day.</p>

<p>You were the first to make such a claim, yet you haven&#39;t substantiated anything.</p>

<div class="md"><p>Your comment about 20 grams appeared first in the thread.</p>

<p>The 10 grams I mentioned is the dose for under-responders.</p>

<p>I can&#39;t find anything anywhere saying there&#39;s benefit past 10.</p>

<p>The onus is on you, bud. Should be easy for you to prove this.</p>

<div class="md"><p>I am more than willing to physically prove it to you by competing in a multi stage test of athleticism against the subjects of the study.</p>

<p>Bench, deads, broad jump, high jump, 60m sprint, 1 mile run and an olympic distance triathlon.</p>

<p>We&#39;ll see who&#39;s approach works better in actuality.</p>

<div class="md"><p>FULL STOP. Isn&#39;t that what you like to say? Look, I love Creatine. It&#39;s great. It has myriad benefits beyond just muscle loading. It&#39;s also neuro-protective. It is hands-down the number one most-researched performance supplement. So when someone makes a casual claim that &quot;20 grams is a great dose&quot; lol, I want to see your reasoning.</p>

<p>WHAT makes 20 grams a &quot;great dose&quot;? Why is that a better dose than 10 grams at the highest? There should be mountains of studies proving the efficacy of this larger dose you&#39;re advocating for. Could you be talking about a loading dose, and not your daily maintenance dose thereafter? That would be an honest mistake.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t want to see your anecdotal bro jumps. I want cold hard factual evidence. Or shut the fuck up.</p>
