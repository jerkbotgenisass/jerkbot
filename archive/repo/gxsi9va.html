<p>Well this is a new level of stupidity. You know that specialty bars let you do lifts that get you big and strong that you canâ€™t do with a straight bar. Right?</p>

<div class="md"><p>Hahahahaha oh boy the retardness in you is so strong. xD</p>

<p>Yeah cause there has not been thousands of powerlifters &amp; strongman in the past who trained and got strong without using these &quot;special barbell&quot; yeah bitch please go check your brain. xD</p>

<p>Not sure about prices cause not bought alot of gym equipment but i would say those barbells would cost atleast 200 dollars each, he got 7 when he could just need 1 so not having to buy 6 of them and voila saved 1200 dollars to put on other equipment he needs or save up the cash for other stuff or invest it.</p>

<p>But i guess you are one of those beta males who can&#39;t train in the gym without wearing gloves cause you can&#39;t get big or strong unless you use gloves. xD</p>

<p>You probaly the guy who go into the locker room and are on your knees to give men &quot;handies&quot; to get your protein shake connor style...</p>
