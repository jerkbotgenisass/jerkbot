<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I&#39;m lifting for almost 9 years with none interruption, however I lift natty as ectomorph and my gym was closed like 6 months due pandemic, I just returned and it closed again and now is reopen, I&#39;m very depressed because I lost a lot of my strength and mm, and I skipped the gym the whole week, yesterday was my first day after this long skip because I&#39;m no longer motivated, I feels like I was abandoned by my own muscles, and I feels like lifting weights are futile and vain, because if I stop for 1 week is enough to lose strength and 6 months due to the covid is enough to lose a huge part of my hard gains, by the way its not worth at all once I feels like I&#39;m a hostage of my own muscles and life style, no motivation to train while feeling depressive by losing my gains, no matter what I do ill feel sad in the end, at home skipping the gym and defying or attending the gym without motivation and feeling weak.</p>

<p>I have some friends that takes a lot of drugs to be motivated, not just roids but also Horse stimulants like potenay etc, and this is out of questioning for me, not just due to the health but also I&#39;m already a hostage of my body and I don&#39;t want to be a hostage of synthetic drugs.</p>

<p>I also realized that the reasons why I have started to lift when I was teenager were very futile, I was insecure about myself, I&#39;d like to be respected and tbh this motivation I had when I started to lift I don&#39;t have now as an adult because I&#39;m confident about myself and I don&#39;t need anymore to concern about what do others think, I was already lifting for years just to keep my body, but now that I lost a bit of my muscular mass even this motivation I don&#39;t have. Now I need to reasons and words of help</p>

<div class="md"><p>Since you mentioned health ruining drugs. May I ask if you have heard about microdosing magic mushrooms or lsd and the motivation they induce with little to none health risk? I&#39;m not suggesting you to take drugs of course but you can make a little research. For me personally I take a microdose on every chest day and my workout is so productive that i get motivated to do all the other fitness related things.</p>
