Getting out of the awkward phase

<p>Growing up I felt like everyone had a good feature on them but me. Tbh I never really went past the awkward - ugly duckling phase. </p>

<p>If you managed to improve, what were some things that helped you?</p>

<div class="md"><p>Honestly, money. I am still mooching off the parents but it’s true that money is what has made the biggest difference. </p>

<p>Money paid for my Brazilian butt lift. I have a nice ass now whereas before it was a pancake. </p>

<p>Money pays for my gym membership (150 a month). </p>

<p>Money paid for my 15k breast reduction. </p>

<p>Money paid for my lip fillers and the occasional jaw filler (don’t do anymore). </p>

<p>Money pays for my daily takeout raw vegetable salad and kale juice. I eat twice a day so having this for one meal and then whatever I want for the other meal has kept my weight in check. </p>

<p>Money pays for my skin treatments (chemical peels, lasers, facials). </p>

<p>Money pays for my beauty products (use mostly high end makeup/skincare, like tom Ford and biologique recherche). </p>

<p>Money paid for my designer clothes (not necessary but I do have some very high end pieces). Still sleep in target pajamas though lol. </p>

<p>Money paid for my braces and teeth whitener. </p>

<p>Money paid for eyebrow micro blading. </p>

<p>Money pays for my latisse.</p>

<p>Money pays for my hair appointments. </p>

<p>I really think it all comes down to having access to financial resources. Sad, but true. I don’t know how I will afford all of this once I am on my own in the “real world”. Gives me anxiety about it. My father still makes a decent amount of money but considerably less than he used to (close to 800,000 a year). I have no job or savings so I don’t know how I will be able to afford my upkeep.</p>
