<div class="md"><p>Sadly no numbers to back it up, I think the sentiment was more that most trainees in this sub are in the beginner to intermediate stage of their training, and would likely know that a swing of 75KG is not a realistic thing for them to do for a while.</p>

<div class="md"><p>Beginner I will give you but definitely wouldn&#39;t agree with &quot;<em>most people</em> <em>between 24KG - 32KG gunning for Timed Simple&quot;.</em> If you meant amongst the frequent commenters then maybe, but you need to realize that the frequent commenters are in the 10s out of a membership in the 1000s.</p>

<p>My guesstimate would be that there are more people on this subreddit with tendon issues specifically from kettlebelling than there are people who are currently swinging between 24 to 32 kgs.</p>

<p>LOL, tendon issues from kettlebells are much less frequent than you think.</p>

<div class="md"><p>I was basing it off the rash of tendonosis related posts here and the loads of comments and pms I received when I posted something about golfer&#39;s elbow. Granted that is an unscientific sampling of this subreddit, but that is IMHO significantly better data than what you are basing it off which (it seems like) is a very narrow demographic of youth participating in sports not limited to kettlebelling/lifting.</p>

<p>Correct me if I am wrong, and please clarify what exactly you meant by &quot;sports participation&quot; i.e. the demographic you were referring to and the sports you were referring to.</p>

<div class="md"><p>When I think of golfer&#39;s elbow I don&#39;t think of sports off the bat [pun intended], I think of occupation. Specifically an occupation where one is doing a repeated motion for hours every day. <a href="https://academic.oup.com/aje/article/164/11/1065/61970">Looking at population level data about 90% of those with medial epicondylitis is due to occupation; while only about 0.4% of the population having this condition</a>.</p>

<p>Furthermore, when one looks more at the data it&#39;s usually a woman who plays recreational tennis in her 50s that will develop this, if it is sports related. I say this because the peak incidence for tendinopathies is being aged 45 to 64 and a women; who are over represented compared to men. Going based off the demographic that frequents this sub, and reddit at large, it&#39;s mostly young men who are otherwise healthy. Given all of this, no, I don&#39;t think that there are thousands of people on this sub who have tendon issues in their elbows.</p>

<p>I think you are confusing between the demographic of frequent posters/commenters vs the actual demographic of the group (most of them are lurkers).Â I would be willing to bet that the median age of this group is significantly higher than whatever your estimate is, and also not as healthy as you think. Sure there are lots of young men here because of gyms shutting down, but there are also lots of infrequent exercisers, sedentary people and older folks who have been jolted into taking greater care of their health due to the pandemic scare, and not to forget the women in this community.</p>

<p>No one said thousands so why misattribute a bogus data point?! Though I will stand by that that within this subreddit -</p>

<pre><code>people with tendon issues specifically from kettlebelling &gt; people who are currently swinging between 24 to 32 kgs
</code></pre>

<p>Regarding the study - how is a general population study useful when talking specifically about people who have been lifting heavy weights with their hands, and most of them are lifting weights that they never did before? That study seems like a needless red herring in this discussion. If an ultramarathon subreddit were discussing cardiomegaly would you cite a general population study to say - <em>&quot;don&#39;t worry about this, it hardly affects anyone&quot;</em>?</p>

<div class="md"><p>Nothing you&#39;ve said actually refutes anything I&#39;ve said, and instead dances around it while also exaggerating the demographic on Reddit at large. </p>

<p>General population data determines positive predictive value, which determines the order in which tests are ordered. If you&#39;re asking why I referenced it, it&#39;s because that&#39;s the most highly cited population data in the world on this and it&#39;s what UpToDate cites with it&#39;s tendinopathy article. Given that there isn&#39;t a longitudinal cohort study done on kettlebell practitioners, this is the best that we have to work with. The evidence clearly shows that individuals who get golfer&#39;s elbow from their occupation compared to any type of fitness by a factor of 9. While the absolute incidence is still quite low overall. So yes, I think that your estimation is largely exaggerated. </p>

<p>That&#39;s exactly what I&#39;d say. Cardiomegaly is vastly different from cardiomyopathy and there isn&#39;t much evidence to conclude that cardiomegaly from running increases the risk of mortality. Rather, it appears that there is a significant increased in risk of spontaneous ventricular fibrillation during endurance competitions that is independent from heart composition.</p>
