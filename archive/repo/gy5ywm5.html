<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p><strong>Welcome to the Physique Phriday thread</strong></p>

<p>What&#39;s the point of having people guess your body fat? Nevermind that it&#39;s the most inaccurate method available, (read: most likely way wrong - <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20130301185720/https://paindatabase.com/body-fat/">see here</a>) you&#39;re still just putting an arbitrary number to the body you have. Despite people&#39;s claim that they are shooting for a number, they&#39;re really shooting for look - like a six pack.</p>

<p>So let&#39;s stopping mucking around with trivialities and get to the heart of the matter. This thread shall serve two purposes:</p>

<ol>
<li><strong>Physique critiques.</strong> Post some pics and ask about muscles or body parts you need to work on. Or specifically ask about a lagging body part and what exercises worked for others.</li>
<li>An outlet for people that want to show off their efforts that would otherwise be removed due to <a href="https://old.reddit.com/r/Fitness/wiki/rules#wiki_rule_.234">Rule 4</a>, and</li>
</ol>

<p>Let&#39;s keep things civil, don&#39;t be a creep, and adhere to <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/Fitness/wiki/rules#wiki_1._hate_speech_and_discriminatory_remarks_are_not_allowed.">Rule 1</a>. This isn&#39;t a thread to announce what you find attractive in a mate. Please use the report function for any comments that are out of line.</p>

<p>So phittit, what&#39;s your physique pheel like this phriday?</p>

<div class="md"><p>Probably but it also depends on how you look at it. Would you see any real added weight loss in a week? No. But it could have a measurable impact over months.</p>

<div class="md"><p>I mean you do you. I didn&#39;t suggest it or recommend it. I was only explaining the idea behind it. But you brought out the chemist and the biologist in me. </p>

<p>Humans (probably other mammals too) have brown adipose tissue. This tissue has a role in thermoregulation. When exposed to a drop in core temperature the activity of brown adipose tissue increases. What is unique about brown adipose tissue is that the electron transport chain is decoupled from the oxidative phosphorylation process that regenerates ATP from ADP. When the energy that the electron transport chain generates isn&#39;t being converted into chemical energy, the energy created is released as heat. </p>

<p>It is important to note that the electron transport chain is being supplied the reducing species it needs for energy generation from catabolic activities. This added catabolism isn&#39;t as negligible as you make it seem. Obviously it depends on how extreme or casually you take it but it would amount to more than a peanut.</p>

<div class="md"><p><del>You did suggest it</del> got mixed up, thought you were the original commenter, either way you are defending it     </p>

<blockquote>
<p>maybe try increase your calorie expenditure through other methods such as cold showers [...] or just wearing less clothes.   </p>
</blockquote>

<p>I&#39;m not a biologist so I can&#39;t speak with authority to what you&#39;ve written here. But if cold showers and wearing fewer clothes were effective weight loss methods, then there would be evidence of that and they would be common practice.<br/>
Do you have studies showing the effectiveness of cold showers and wearing fewer clothes as fat loss methods?<br/>
You have actually degrees in chemistry and biology?</p>
