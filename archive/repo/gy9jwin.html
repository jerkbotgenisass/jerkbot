Reddit is garbage, because no socially well-adjusted human being wants to moderate reddit for free.

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Just think about it, this website and all major subreddits are run by basement dwellers that have nothing better to do in life than to enforce their &quot;power&quot; on the internet for absolutely nothing in return. (I&#39;m already sure this post will get removed, lol.)
There is nothing that a sane, mentally well adjusted person could get out of moderating a toxic cesspool like reddit, except experiencing a pathetic power trip.</p>

<p>There are definitely smaller subreddits where the mods genuinely care about their work, but 95% of the moderators just have no life and get their only crumbs of serotonin by banning people and removing posts they don&#39;t personally like. How many times have I seen mods make up some shitty rule on the spot just to ban people.</p>

<p>The amount of censorship on this website is scary, and no, I am not some racist that is salty about right wing posts or whatever getting banned. Your opinion on here can be censored by any trigger happy mod, no matter what you have to say. A pretty shitty predicament for the &quot;front page of the internet&quot;.</p>

<p>Edit: The Mods choice award makes this so fucking funny, <sup>thanks</sup> <sup>for</sup> <sup>being</sup> <sup>chill</sup> <sup>mods</sup></p>

<div class="md"><p>Just a couple of days ago, I made a post in <a href="/r/fitness">r/fitness</a> and wanted the community&#39;s opinion on whether I should pick up strength training again or pursue martial arts (MMA) as I was very indecisive for various reasons. Not only got the post removed, I received a message from a mod with a link to a magic 8ball to which I should ask my question to.. I responded that I also could flip a coin while we&#39;re at it but that I was seeking genuine advice and their only response was &quot;a coin is a great idea!&quot;</p>

<p>Asshole.</p>
