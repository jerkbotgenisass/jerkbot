<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p><strong>Welcome to the Physique Phriday thread</strong></p>

<p>What&#39;s the point of having people guess your body fat? Nevermind that it&#39;s the most inaccurate method available, (read: most likely way wrong - <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20130301185720/https://paindatabase.com/body-fat/">see here</a>) you&#39;re still just putting an arbitrary number to the body you have. Despite people&#39;s claim that they are shooting for a number, they&#39;re really shooting for look - like a six pack.</p>

<p>So let&#39;s stopping mucking around with trivialities and get to the heart of the matter. This thread shall serve two purposes:</p>

<ol>
<li><strong>Physique critiques.</strong> Post some pics and ask about muscles or body parts you need to work on. Or specifically ask about a lagging body part and what exercises worked for others.</li>
<li>An outlet for people that want to show off their efforts that would otherwise be removed due to <a href="https://old.reddit.com/r/Fitness/wiki/rules#wiki_rule_.234">Rule 4</a>, and</li>
</ol>

<p>Let&#39;s keep things civil, don&#39;t be a creep, and adhere to <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/Fitness/wiki/rules#wiki_1._hate_speech_and_discriminatory_remarks_are_not_allowed.">Rule 1</a>. This isn&#39;t a thread to announce what you find attractive in a mate. Please use the report function for any comments that are out of line.</p>

<p>So phittit, what&#39;s your physique pheel like this phriday?</p>

<div class="md"><p>Just starting my journey of working out again. Got tested at 25% bf, have a long way to go. It looks better than it actually is because I have lines on my stomach from a former six pack (had one for a decade).</p>

<p>5’6” 26 160</p>

<p><a href="https://imgur.com/a/xn5hvVW">https://imgur.com/a/xn5hvVW</a></p>

<p>Not sure if I should be bulking or cutting first. And looking for some good workout routines. Goal is a body like Kumails: <a href="https://globalnews.ca/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/kumal-nanjiana-buff.jpg?quality=85&amp;strip=all">https://globalnews.ca/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/kumal-nanjiana-buff.jpg?quality=85&amp;strip=all</a></p>

<div class="md"><p>I&#39;d recommend bulking if your <a href="https://www.barbellmedicine.com/blog/how-to-measure-your-waist-correctly/">waist measurement</a> is comfortably below ~36 inches.</p>

<p>Any of the routines in the wiki would be great. Reading the rest of the wiki would likely be helpful as well.</p>

<div class="md"><p>There’s no way to naturally achieve the muscular veiny look and low body fat percentages in a short amount of time. The year and a half from where he is is a generous estimate it’ll probably take you longer naturally. He isn’t natural. Pretty basic stuff here</p>

<div class="md"><p>Are you looking at the correct picture? That dude isn&#39;t very big at all. That&#39;s absolutely achievable naturally. And it wouldn&#39;t take a whole lot of time either, relatively speaking.</p>

<div class="md"><p>So going from 25% bodyfat to around 10% or less is relatively simple process that should not take long at all naturally? On top of packing on I’d say for the OP 10-12lbs of muscle. </p>

<p>If you go the gear route it would take less time. I never said he was huge all things considering, Kumail went from out of shape has never been in shape his whole life to 10% bf and lbs of muscle in less than a year in his 40s, if you think he did it naturally go ahead and do it and report back your findings in a month or two. Be sure to pack on the body fat before you lose it all very quickly naturally lol</p>

<div class="md"><p>I&#39;m not arguing about the time table; a couple years (what I would consider to be a <em>relatively</em> short time period for this endeavor) is a fine estimate.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t know what this Kumail guy did either, nor do I really care. What I&#39;m taking issue with is you suggesting that one would need gear to achieve that physique, which is laughable.</p>

<p>And it is relatively simple: lift and eat a lot then lift and eat less.</p>

<div class="md"><p>No I specifically said either gear or time. He could easily do it with time, but it’s not going to be a short amount of time and it’s going to require quite a bit of discipline. I don’t use gear and most of the time my body is that size give or take some % so it be absurd for me to say it’s simply unattainable naturally. In my second reply I pretty much laid that out and you still disagreed I think you just like the back the forth my dude no offense</p>

<div class="md"><p>I wouldn&#39;t worry about bulk/cut yet. Just get into the gym and get some stuff done first. I like the basics of nsuns program and there are apps that tell you the reps and sets to do (does the math for you)</p>
