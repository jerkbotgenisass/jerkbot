<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>hi, I am male/31, 5&#39;8&#39;&#39; 140 Pounds, about 18%-20% body fat, starting a lean bulk with 10% surplus,</p>

<p>&#x200B;</p>

<p>I cant go to the gym for diffrent reasons,so here is what I do at home:</p>

<p>3 times a week,</p>

<p>&#x200B;</p>

<p>weighted pull ups X3</p>

<p>weighted chin ups X2</p>

<p>weighted push ups X5</p>

<p>lateral raises X4</p>

<p>dumble bicep curls X2</p>

<p>dumble tricep press extenstion X2</p>

<p>&#x200B;</p>

<p>(I dont do deadlifts and squats because I have lower back chronic pain, so I really prefer to keep my back straight when working out)</p>

<p>I assume this workout is not the best it can be, but still is it good enough to gain size and muscle?would you recommend to change or add something in the limits of &quot;home workout&quot;?</p>

<div class="md"><p>Well, first I would rather lose some fat if I was in your place. Of course this depends on your goals and what is your ideal physique.</p>

<p>Second, I would split some of these into separate workouts and introduce more exercises, rather than doing every time the same. Few modification and you can make your workout better.</p>

<p>Also check for the lower back pain, consult your doctor &amp; physiotherapist. Maybe you should work some specific lower back exercises, that can help you to reduce the pain.</p>

<p>Hope this helps.</p>

<p>thats me, do you still think I need to cut? I mean I am allready pretty light weight and I dont have enough muscle to show if I cut</p>

<p>I feel that pull ups is best for back and push ups for chest and they are both compound movements...variation may play role but I really struggle to find more exercises</p>

<div class="md"><p>Most pain recovery in the back always relates with stiffness the area. Maybe it is worth trying to work on the mobility and afterwards stength. For example, hang on a bar and rotate your hips with a completey relaxed back, only hanging with arms....focus is the key. There are certain exercises with will help you with this. Most gym&#39;s won&#39;t help because they concentrate on the stengthen part which is generally not wrong, only more easy. Also.... You gain more use of the muscle you already have which will be more effective. Light plyometric would do the additional effect for strengthening.</p>

<p>Always take care in the work out and focusüôè.</p>

<div class="md"><p>Okay, you dont have 20% for sure, maybe around 15. You can do the lean bulk then.
You are absolutely right, just thought that maybe one day you can focus more on pull ups, doing weghted, regular ones and doing different grips (chin upswide, regular, close). You can add pike push ups and shoulder taps for example for shoulders and do some abs. Other day focus on chest (doing different push ups-regular, diamond, decline, wide, archer and bench dips for example) along with triceps and biceps and third day you can do some circle routine, combining all of these.
Or just try your method for a month or two and then if it is not working you can make adjustments.</p>
