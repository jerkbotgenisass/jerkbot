<div class="md"><p>Before you retards bust all over your faces. What I said was that the person in the picture achieved his body via trt not natural means. He could go the natural route and achieve that in a year and a half but not quickly like the guy in the picture because it’s not natural. It’s pretty simple but this guy is a little bitch for whatever reason and likes to post everything likes he’s in the right and no other opinions can exist. None of us are experts and most of this is novice opinions, I’ve never seen a brother try to appease neckbeards so desperately online tho so that’s new. Every post is like this lmao</p>
