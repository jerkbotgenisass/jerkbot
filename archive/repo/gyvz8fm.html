<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Hey I only have 2 dumbbells to work with (35lb each) and 2 (10lbs) dumbbells as well. I am a beginner to squats and have weak legs in general. I&#39;d like to know if I can combine a deadlift with either 1 or 2 dumbbells with some form of goblet squat or similar. Like a superset? Thanks</p>

<div class="md"><p>If you are a beginner you donâ€™t need to do supersets, or any other intensity technique for that matter. Goblet squats and deadlifts are good choices though, just do normal sets    with rest breaks. In fact, another way to make your workout progress without lots of weights is to start at 90 seconds rest between sets then each workout reduce the rest time by 10 seconds until you get to 10 second rest periods, then add reps and start over.</p>
