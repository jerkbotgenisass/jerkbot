<div class="md"><p>What are you suppose to do between sets? Stare at the wall? Better not use your phone to log sets either might be on social media. Bring your notepad to your 100+ a month gym or you might be on social media.</p>

<div class="md"><p>You&#39;ve just given me a flashback of my high school football days.  80-100 of us in a weightroom with ~20 squat racks.  Coach sets the pace of starting each set with a whistle (shouting &#39;second set&#39;, blowing the whistle, then your group rotating through and each getting your second set).  When you&#39;re not lifting, spotting, or moving weights you were expected to be kneeling silently out of the way....</p>

<div class="md"><p>Reflect on how the lift went and prepare for the next one. Visualize and meditate. Treat training like the competition room. Practice mental focus. </p>

<p>Logging sets is obviously not social media.</p>

<div class="md"><p>Why is this getting downvoted? There&#39;s plenty of studies that say that this is exactly what you should do and leads to increased output on lifts.</p>

<div class="md"><p>I&#39;m curious, too. There is no question you&#39;d train better.</p>

<p>I guess in this thread the people who just want to have a good time feel like it&#39;s unfair for a whole gym to try to enforce taking training more seriously.</p>

<p>The answer to that is simple: train in a gym that suits your style, and don&#39;t hate on clubs that want a more serious environment.</p>

<div class="md"><p>I think it depends on your goals. If long term you&#39;re aiming to be a national medalist or something similarly high level. Your focus should be to do whatever facilitates that. If you&#39;re training for fun. Then do what makes it fun.</p>

<p>However I think a lot of people who train for fun, try to take it seriously and don&#39;t enjoy themselves anywhere near as much as they could.</p>

<div class="md"><p>In counterpoint to lifters who take things too seriously, there are many lifters, at all levels, who set lofty goals for themselves and for whom achievement of those goals is important enough that they will dedicate inordinate amounts of their energy in pursuit of those goals, yet will be unable to put their phones away for a couple of hours a day.</p>

<p>In all honesty, I don&#39;t think this makes training more &quot;fun&quot; for those people; I think it just makes it more likely that they hit plateaus and get frustrated.</p>

<p>Much of the &quot;fun&quot; in weightlifting is the self-actualization and the process by which they achieve that. A training environment where everyone is paying attention and invested in the success of themselves and others is much more enjoyable than one where many people are buried in their devices.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t think the context of these signs in this gym is as simple as an edict from on high. I think the coaches identified a problem with athletes not paying attention and tried to take steps towards making a better training environment for the team as a whole.</p>
