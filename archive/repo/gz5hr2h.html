<div class="md"><p>Abs are not unnatural, but very fucking dangerous to have for prolonged periods of time. Its why bodybuilders and actors don&#39;t stay in shape year round but starve and dehydrate themselves in preparation for competitions and jobs. It&#39;s slightly easier for women to have them I believe, but you need like 6% body fat, and most doctors recommend you stay at around 10% at minimum. Any less than that and you&#39;re at risk of multiple health issues.</p>

<p>Edit: According to the American Council on Exercise (ACE), for abs you need to lower your body fat to about 14 to 20 percent for women and 6 to 13 percent for men. I was half wrong to use 6% in this comment, as its only that low for men, not women. Genetics are also hugely important. </p>

<p>Basically what I&#39;m trying to say is, don&#39;t spend hours and hours in the gym trying to get abs, unless you&#39;re a professional like the woman in the photo. They&#39;re hard to get, hard to maintain and potentially harmful in the long run</p>

<p>6% is ridicioules low only reachable if your a pro bodybuilder (and they mostly Stop at 8%) or a victim of conenctration camps.</p>

<div class="md"><p>True its a higher percentage when flexing, but I mean constant abs like in movies and shit, that&#39;s unhealthy. And it&#39;s been a while since I learnt about body fat and muscle mass so I apologise for having wrong numbers, but my point still stands. Abs are quite unhealthy and only professionals should really aim to have them. However, I want to make it clear that I don&#39;t think she&#39;s unattractive for being muscular, and the people criticising her are awful people.</p>

<div class="md"><p>You don’t need 6% body fat for abs, that’s insanely low. I agree it would be dangerous to have abs like that for a prolonged period of time if you’re a woman. Men have significantly lower body fat than women mainly because of muscle. But for the average man if he works out pretty regularly, needs about 18% body fat or less for abs to start showing. Doctors do recommend a minimum body fat percentage of 10% but above 25% is considered unhealthy too, for men. For women, anything above 30% is considered unhealthy and anything under 15% is considered unhealthy.</p>

<div class="md"><p>Well I’m not American so I don’t know about that. But I’ve studied nutrition and know about fitness, and everything I’ve seen agrees on 18% body fat for men being the starting point at showing abs. Maybe you need 6% to 13% if you don’t workout, for your abs to show. 6% to 13% is classified as very fit athletes and body builders. Which is not healthy in the long run. I have a friend that has a six pack and hes about 15% body fat.</p>

<div class="md"><p>Considering its the American Council of Exercise, I&#39;m inclined to believe they mean you lower your body fat, while exercising. I&#39;m very happy you know someone who has good genes and has slightly higher body fat than other people with abs, but I hope you&#39;ll forgive me for believing a relatively well respected group who are experts in this field, over a random person on reddit. No hard feelings though man.</p>

<div class="md"><p>Okay, but this is a woman and 6% is way too low of an estimate lol. </p>

<p>And fyi it&#39;s not that its easier for women to get abs, men start off with a lower fat % than women and naturally have more muscle mass. it&#39;s actually harder for women as they have less testosterone and more estrogen, and estrogen affects fat distribution.</p>

<div class="md"><p>I have also apologised in another comment for having a slightly lower number than was accurate for women. I don&#39;t specialise in human anatomy and physiology. I&#39;m a genetics nerd. But nowhere in my original comment did I say abs were unhealthy, only for women. They&#39;re very unhealthy for both sexes, and more so for men, that&#39;s true, but it&#39;s also important to mention that abs are not something everyone should aim for, as only professionals, like the woman in question, understand how to keep a good amount of body fat so they don&#39;t reach unhealthy levels.</p>
