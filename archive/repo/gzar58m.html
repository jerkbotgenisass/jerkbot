<div class="md"><p>This hardly qualifies as “banging” weights. To anyone reading this that’s been in the same situation, keep doing your thing. That’s what a fucking gym is for. </p>

<p>And if anyone complains about “banging” weights, give them a more accurate demonstration and drop some barbells from overhead. That’ll give them a good point of reference.</p>

<div class="md"><p>He definitely banged them on the ground. If you can&#39;t complete a rep without dropping weights, it&#39;s not just your weight that needs adjusting, it&#39;s your ego.</p>

<p>I can deadlift without dropping the bar, if he can&#39;t he&#39;s lifting too much. And no, misusing equipment to make yourself feel stronger than you are is not what gyms are for.</p>

<div class="md"><p>My comment to that is this guy isn&#39;t a pro lifter and isn&#39;t in a competition. Again, if you&#39;re doing reps so high that you can&#39;t put the bar down without dropping it, your weights are too high. A competition is going to have padding and it&#39;s expected everyone will do one rep at their max. This isn&#39;t a competition.</p>

<p>Ok Dr semantics, my point is that any reasonable person lifting a reasonable amount of weight wouldn&#39;t be tossing weights around due to risk of hurting themselves if they don&#39;t. Not sure what you&#39;re trying to get out of this, the guy isn&#39;t lifting 800lbs or anything. It may very well be near his max but given the environment if he can&#39;t set the weights down properly he should be using less weight.</p>

<p>First of all, it&#39;s not throwing. It&#39;s just a rapid descent. Throwing the bar down in a deadlift is extremely poor form and will give you injury.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>Okay, I honestly don&#39;t think you&#39;ve spent much time at all in any common gym. If you think this kind of lifting is uncommon, unhealthy or unreasonable, you have absolutely no experience and/or knowledge on this subject. I challenge you to find me any major weightlifting institution or authority figure who agrees with your sentiment.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Not sure what you&#39;re trying to get out of this, the guy isn&#39;t lifting 800lbs or anything</p>
</blockquote>

<p>You seem to not be able to grasp the super simple concept of relative weight. I think this is another symptom of your lack of knowledge on lifting. This idea that you have to be lifting at a heavy absolute weight to use the tactics actual heavy lifters do is completely nuts. If you&#39;re 165cm at 65kg, lifting anything over 150kg is going to be very impressive, and well before that point you should start to lift like the pros are doing. You don&#39;t have to be lifting 350kg to warrant proper form. I have no idea why you made that point.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>It may very well be near his max but given the environment if he can&#39;t set the weights down properly he should be using less weight.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>If the gym disallows it, then of course he shouldn&#39;t do it. However, in any gym that allows deadlifting, this is a 100% expected and accepted descent.</p>

<p>I need you to present evidence that it&#39;s unhealthy or bad form somehow. Literally every single authority I&#39;ve ever heard about it say it&#39;s natural. </p>

<p>And this is just flat-out wrong. If you&#39;re lifting at or near your max, <em>it is proper deadlift form to drop the weights somewhat rapidly.</em> I&#39;m not saying slam them into the ground.

<p>That&#39;s too heavy. Back off the weights some and lift an amount you can actually handle without dropping the bar.</p>

<p>Maybe you&#39;re misunderstanding what I&#39;m saying. This looks like a general purpose gym.

<p><strong>This is a different point from what you made before.</strong> If a gym disallows proper weightlifting (perhaps if it&#39;s more casual or cardio oriented), then <em>of course he shouldn&#39;t be lifting his max.</em></p>

<p>However, <em>you&#39;ve maintained that this is wrong and improper form.</em> That anyone who lifts like that is lifting too heavy for their own good. <em>That is absolutely not the case.</em> Like you just did here:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>That&#39;s too heavy. Back off the weights some and lift an amount you can actually handle without dropping the bar.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>He&#39;s not dropping the bar. Jesus Christ, how many times are you going to lie about the form? He&#39;s just rapidly (but controlled) descending <em>which is proper form for a heavy deadlift.</em></p>
