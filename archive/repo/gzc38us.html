Bodybuilding’s affect on sprinting

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Im a sophomore in high school and sprint for the track team. My events and times are: 55(7.27), 300(39.93), 100(11.9), and 200(24.1).</p>

<p>I have been doing an Arnold split workout routine and wonder if it is smart to aim for muscle as a sprinter. For legs I only aim for strength and explosiveness to get faster but for chest, back, and arms I work towards hypertrophy. Would this make me faster, slower, or neither?</p>

<p>Edit: I forgot to clarify that on top of the Arnold split I do interval training almost everyday at practice</p>

<div class="md"><p>No. Body building is good for getting bigger and nothing else. Dense muscle is inflexible and heavy mass is bad for moving fast. You&#39;ll notice athletes have an easier time going from sports to body building than the other way around. Also consider that body building is about astetics, where as competitive weight lifting / strongman is about being as strong as possible. And you&#39;ll notice while those guys are terrifyingly powerful, they don&#39;t tend to be successful in other sports. </p>

<p>If you wanna be a sprinter, train to be a sprinter. Vanity muscle is worthless outside of just about everything except contests to see who has the prettiest vanity muscle</p>
