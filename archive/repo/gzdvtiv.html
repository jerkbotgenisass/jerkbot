<div class="md"><p>It&#39;s a fundamental human movement so how can it be bad? I will agree that picking up 500 lbs of the floor is beyond fundamental, however.</p>

<div class="md"><p>It’s fundamental yes, but it’s not fundamental to do the movement at that extent with that many reps, at that weight. </p>

<p>It causes wear and tear on many different joints, BUT, as i said the benefits outweigh the disadvantages because you’ll have sturdier muscles, tendons and ligaments supporting those joints. </p>

<p>If you’ve got 2 50 year old guys, 1 who hasnt deadlifted ever, and 1 who has deadlifted regularly for the past 20-30 years, the deadlifter will have more wear and tear on his knee joints for instance, but stronger muscles, tendons and ligaments supporting his knee joints resulting in a net positive. </p>

<p>It’s also the powerlifting lift that’s most taxing on your central nervous system, with research suggesting it can take up to 8 days for your CNS to recover. Ofcourse your CNS adapts to volume but if you’re starting out in the gym and don’t know your body in and out yet you could run into some troubles.</p>

<div class="md"><p>That &quot;wear and tear&quot; concept you mentioned is not supported by any scientific literature. It is from an old school  model of &quot;biomechanics&quot; that with further research they have found to be very limited. Humans are not machines, we do not have finite number of repetitions of a movement before something &quot;wears out&quot;. Our joints are complexes that are made up of and involve bone/cartilage/muscle/tendon/ligaments. It is a bit odd to say that our tendons/muscles/ligaments respond positively to something, but causes wear and tear of something else within the same complex. If you are specifically talking about boney surfaces of a joint they also positively respond to load. Cartilage, articular surfaces, and bone all respond positively to correct loading.</p>

<p>However, chronic overloading without proper recovery can lead to injury. With extreme heavy powerlifting that CAN be the case, however most people are not doing that. </p>

<div class="md"><p>It is, but only for lower weights, not the small car masses these guys attempt.</p>
