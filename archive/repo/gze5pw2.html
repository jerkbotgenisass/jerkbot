<div class="md"><p>It’s fundamental yes, but it’s not fundamental to do the movement at that extent with that many reps, at that weight. </p>

<p>It causes wear and tear on many different joints, BUT, as i said the benefits outweigh the disadvantages because you’ll have sturdier muscles, tendons and ligaments supporting those joints. </p>

<p>If you’ve got 2 50 year old guys, 1 who hasnt deadlifted ever, and 1 who has deadlifted regularly for the past 20-30 years, the deadlifter will have more wear and tear on his knee joints for instance, but stronger muscles, tendons and ligaments supporting his knee joints resulting in a net positive. </p>

<p>It’s also the powerlifting lift that’s most taxing on your central nervous system, with research suggesting it can take up to 8 days for your CNS to recover. Ofcourse your CNS adapts to volume but if you’re starting out in the gym and don’t know your body in and out yet you could run into some troubles.</p>

<div class="md"><p>This is only valid if deadlifting is the only exercise they do. If you took the first 50 year old guy and had him doing squats instead of deadlifts I would argue he&#39;s going to be in much better shape overall than the deadlifter. It takes more muscles through a fuller ROM and doesn&#39;t put as much direct strain on the lower back. </p>

<p>The question isn&#39;t between &quot;deadlifts&quot; and &quot;not workout out at all.&quot; It&#39;s about constructing a routine that doesn&#39;t require deadlifting, which (as Oberst says) is what you should be doing unless you&#39;re competing and it&#39;s a necessary lift.</p>

<p>And the guy who does squats and deadlifts will be better off than just the squatter or just the deadlifter.</p>

<p>Straining the lower back muscles with appropriate movements and loading is a pretty excellent way to develop a stronger and more injury resistant lower back</p>

<p>Oberst is essentially saying to not do them if you&#39;re a high performance athlete and don&#39;t compete in a sport that requires deadlifting. He&#39;s not really suggesting that average joes shouldn&#39;t avoid deadlifts if they want to deadlift.</p>

<p>Sometimes you read something that&#39;s so colossally dumb that you can&#39;t even properly figure out how to respond.</p>

<p>Okay slugger, whatever you say. Have a good one.</p>

<p>I&#39;m sorry, do you think having a weaker lower back makes your back more resistant to injury?</p>

<p>Also I&#39;m not sure why you picked squats previously to compare to deadlifts. Are you under the impression that they&#39;re interchangeable despite having different prime movers and two completely distinct movement patterns? If someone wanted to do bent over rows would you suggest they&#39;re too dangerous because they might stress your back, and suggest bench press instead?</p>
