<div class="md"><p>Sumo may count in powerlifting, it may have &quot;deadlift&quot; in its name (but so does trap bar). It is not an equally impressive display of strength. Sick to death of tiny kids flexing their 3x bw sumo pull and everyone reacting with pure awe and amazement. Meanwhile their conventional is usually 60-70% of their sumo. Throw a 200lb atlas stone in front of them and suddenly they&#39;re not as strong as everyone thought.</p>

<p>It&#39;s a good exercise, but to me it&#39;s comparable to telling someone &quot;yeah I squatted 675 for 3&quot; when what you really did was hack squat it for 3 in wraps. It&#39;s just not the same.</p>
