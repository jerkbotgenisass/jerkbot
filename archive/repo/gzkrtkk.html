<div class="md"><p>well besides the fact that you&#39;re doing sumo 1rm and the histrionics about locking it out, looking in the mirror, &#39;mirin yourself, and then dropping the bar, pretty decent effort.  but yeah you aint going to get much love on this sub for a 1 rep max sumo.</p>

<div class="md"><p>To summarize: this isn&#39;t a powerlifting sub, powerlifting is a bullshit sport (anyone can make a federation with arbitrary rules), sumo is illegal in the competitive sport closest aligned to the subreddit (Strengthlifting), sumo is less effective in regards to getting strong (which is what we&#39;re interested in),  mentioning RPE on a sumo deadlift with a weight that many untrained males can hit in a couple of months on the program that this sub advocates, and being compeltely ignorant of what this sub is about probably isn&#39;t doing you any favors either.</p>

<div class="md"><p>Your hips raise a bit before the bar moves, so your starting position is probably a bit off.</p>

<p>It looks like you&#39;re not really in sync in the begining, your hips move but your knees don&#39;t really start moving until the weight has nearly cleared them. Yet they also manage to lock out just before your hips. </p>

<p>What appears to be a max single is a really bad way to check form, since you would expect the most breakdown there. </p>

<p>Compare my <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/CPOttd2D5vJ/?utm_medium=copy_link">675</a> to <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/CN_D8D0jwmc/?utm_medium=copy_link">435x12</a></p>

<p>Even though the 435s are pretty buttery smooth, there are plenty of errors in the max. Probably because I tried it as a joke and didn&#39;t realize it might happen until the bar left the ground, but you can clearly see it get away from me because my legs move too quickly and my hips can&#39;t keep up.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t know enough about the sumo deadlift to comment on your form. It&#39;s not covered in the books. Your technique looks fine in regards to being mechanically sound/not injuring causing. If it&#39;s the most efficient way to pull and other sumo idiosyncrasies, no idea.</p>

<div class="md"><p>Starting strength can be a misnomer. SS is an actual program conceived and facilitated by Mark Rippetoe out of Wichita Falls TX.  It‚Äôs foundation revolves around strict forms that he feels are best to increase overall general strength. The reason you are getting hate here is 1. Due to the lack of tact in people today and 2. The aforementioned description of the program. 
Check out his website.  I‚Äôve read the books‚Ä¶.they aren‚Äôt the hardest read but not the easiest either if you don‚Äôt have a biomechanics/ exercise physiology background.  Get starting strength basic barbell training first.  Then get practical programming for strength training if you really want to get into this.  It takes some time but we‚Äôll worth it.  Cheers!</p>

<p>Do yourself a favor and leave. SS is a rippetoe cult. Everything outside his dogmatic views is shunned.</p>

<p>If you&#39;re looking for a community where people actually care about getting stronger try <a href="/r/weightroom">r/weightroom</a>. Read the sidebar first though. For beginner questions try the dedicated threads in <a href="/r/fitness">r/fitness</a> and read their wiki.</p>

<p>I didn&#39;t say Strengthlifting wasn&#39;t. By &quot;arbitrary rules&quot; they&#39;re arbitrary in the sense of unenforced--e.g., whitelighting squats that are clearly above parallel.  I&#39;m not a fan of any of these static competitions; they&#39;re so very nonathletic and boring.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>sumo is less effective in regards to getting strong</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Your back angle is more vertical and closer to the squat (or even more vertical beyond that). So, the loading on your back is much less (since your back acts as the lever through which torque from the bar is transmitted and torque you&#39;re tradingis proportional to the effective length of that lever--in this case, the effective length is the horizontal distance from the bar to your hips). The ROM is clearly shorter and it looks like (from OP&#39;s lift) that there&#39;s a greater knee extension (and hence quadriceps involvement) than in the conventional deadlift.</p>

<p>That is to say, the sumo dead looks an awful lot like a half squat and we&#39;re already training the squat--better to use the conventional deadlift that is more dissimilar to the squat (more horizontal back angle, greater hip extension ROM) if we&#39;re interested in a general adaptation of strength.</p>

<p>Happy?</p>

<div class="md"><p>Well the whole thing is really misapplied to begin with, since relatively complex human movements are ill suited to be represented by simple point mass diagrams.</p>

<p>Yet and still, the lever arm (which you seem to call &quot;the effective length of the lever&quot;?) would be the distance between the &#39;point of application of the force&#39; (your shoulders basically) and the axis of rotation (which would be orthogonal to the floor).</p>

<p>You also seem to conflate the torque produced about the hip with the tension through the back, although they are obviously related.</p>

<p>But again, all this is moot since human movement cannot be reduced to stick figure force diagrams, since we aren&#39;t stick figures.</p>

<p>Additionally, we can empirically see that sumo and conventional seem to produce similar adaptations as evidenced by most people&#39;s pulls of either style are relatively close. Jamal Browner just pulled 950 conventional. If they were so drastically different we wouldn&#39;t see such clear carryover.</p>

<p>This doesn&#39;t follow at all. The conventional deadlift is <em>more</em> differentiated from the squat, that doesn&#39;t mean there isn&#39;t commonality between the two. There is no good reason to do front squats except as a light squat day. The back squat is heavier and trains everything the front squat trains.</p>

<p>The fucking irony. Rip didn‚Äôt like powerlifting (probably because he‚Äôs never really trained anyone of note to success in the sport) so he took his ball and went home. </p>

<p>sumo is less effective in regards to getting strong (which is what we‚Äôre interested in),</p>

<p>Why is that?</p>

<p>mentioning RPE</p>

<p>Ya ya we know. Rip has <em>another</em> shitty take. What else is new?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>being compeltely ignorant of what this sub is about probably isn‚Äôt doing you any favors either.</p>
