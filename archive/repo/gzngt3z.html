<div class="md"><p>Crossfits always ends with a doctor&#39;s visit. My step brother was a Crossfit maniac for about a year, then he blew his knee out doing some made up squats. Crossfit will get you hurt, and these people should be charged for acting like fitness experts when all they do is get people hurt.</p>

<div class="md"><p>Been doing crossfit for 3 years and never ended up in the hospital. Like any method of training, there&#39;s a degree of risk, but that can be hugely mitigated by quality coaching.</p>

<div class="md"><p>That&#39;s a separate issue, and I doubt it&#39;s even quantifiable. Bad coaches exist in literally every sport and fitness modality. If you had a bad experience with a track coach, would you just say &quot;Fuck all running&quot;?</p>

<div class="md"><p>It’s more about how the way crossfit is run. Their methods and form instruction are disparate across branches. It’s not well vetted so your chances of getting a good one are low. </p>

<p>For example I see multiple sources from crossfit teaching lifters to externally rotate their shoulders during the snatch transition to increase their backward overhead mobility. This is very wrong and will end up in injury of the shoulders in many ways. Olympic lifters use internal rotation of the shoulders for greater stability and strength while increasing their mobility by doing specific mobility exercises to target shoulders and allow this movement.</p>

<div class="md"><p>That&#39;s a much more well rounded argument. The majority of what I see in crossfit criticism is just &quot;Crossfit is stupid&quot;. The affiliate model, and a weekend certification to get the keys to a coaching position definitely isn&#39;t effective in building consistent quality coaching and crossfit experiences globally. </p>

<p>I think now that CrossFit is mainstream and here to stay, consumers are wizening up to quality coaching / programming and lot&#39;s of bad actors in the industry are going to fall off.</p>

<div class="md"><p>I mean any bodybuilding or powerlifting &quot;coach&quot; can be totally bullshit too. Crossfit just has more ridiculous made up exercises so you&#39;re more likely to get hurt. But I&#39;m sure there are power lifting coaches out there who get their clients hurt with stupid advice too.</p>

<p>I agree crossfit is a recipe for disaster, I just don&#39;t think there&#39;s much &quot;vetting&quot; of amateur coaches in other lifting modalities either.</p>

<div class="md"><p>I did it for a year, only reason I stopped is the price. Just too expensive for me. My gym had some good coaches and never pushed us if they could see our form was wrong, or if we were visibly spent. We learned all the lifts the proper way through tedious exercises that broke down each portion of the lift. Reddit really hates CrossFit but I guarantee you the majority of people trashing it never stepped foot in a gym.</p>
