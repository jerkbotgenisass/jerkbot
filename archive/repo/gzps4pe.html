<div class="md"><p>How do you not injure lower back more on any leg raising ‚Äúback exercise‚Äù? I‚Äôve been dealing with a therapy resistant back pain for all of my young adult life and well into adulthood. Low weight high volume deadlifts helped a lot until I re-injured it by riding a bike uphill while staying seated. Something about the pushing to go uphill with my heels and probably not bracing correctly, either way it completely gave up on me. Cue two months off work and constant PT. Now deadlifts feel a thing of the past. Hip rotation is declining as is flexibility as the years go on. I‚Äôm 30 and move like an old fella. </p>

<p>I remember one of the PTs had me doing calf and hamstring stretches daily, hard and gritty, truly making it hurt on purpose to get some fascia broken and ligaments/tendons pulled out. At the end of one of those he had me lay down and do leg raises. It was nearly impossible for me to do it with good enough form, even after stretching my legs and calf‚Äôs as well as I ever have, because of the back injury.  At some point my right hip always pops during a leg raise, and the lower back/hips take over instantly and without command. So no matter what I‚Äôm automatically at risk of hurting my back again. Even with the PT guiding my movement. He seemed frustrated because for all intents and purposes I look like it should be a simple exercise. It feels as difficult form wise as a front squat for god sakes. </p>

<p>If I lay with my lower back touching the ground first and my hips angled up I can do some crunches. That‚Äôs it tho. I just can‚Äôt imagine being able to raise my legs without my lower back taking over at some point. My rheumatologist said that I am one of the hardest loaders he‚Äôs ever seen in practice while still retaining muscle mass. What he was saying is when I go from flexion to relaxed; bent over to standing straight, my upper half switches all the weight over to my lower half very abruptly at the base of my spine, and middle back to pelvis. He said quote,‚ÄùI hate to say it like your foot doctor but you‚Äôll always be like this. All you can do is try to keep it stronger longer. Pain will be relative to that effort.‚Äù Mega sigh. 
The foot doctor, I forget their names, told me while looking at my gait,‚Äùoh the problem is just that god didn‚Äôt make you to walk. Your feet are not made for distance, speed or strength. You can only get insoles, and try not to do anything long distance. <strong>You just have bad feet</strong>.‚Äù Ultra sigh. </p>

<p>Mofuk was right too. Achilles tendinitis and fasciitis have been some ongoing keep it at-bay battle with heel drops and calf stretches anytime I get active again. Truly lost hope. Even bought one of those Roman horses I think they are called to do back extensions and that just seems to make the actual spot I load as previously spoken hurt instead of the area around it. Maybe I‚Äôm having the same issues keeping form right or over extending.</p>

<div class="md"><p>Lay on your back, keep your shoulders on the ground (or do the best you can at first), keep one leg straight out, raise the other one straight up to perpendicular to the ground, and then rotate at your hips to bring that leg down across your other leg and to the ground and hold (should look like this |- ).  Then switch legs.</p>

<p>At first it might be difficult to keep your shoulders on the ground with your hips rotated, but this will improve with more stretching.</p>

<p>Also, stretch you hamstrings often (toe touches, either standing or sitting).  A lot of lower back pain is compounded by tight hamstrings.</p>

<div class="md"><p>both times were the result of irresponsible owners not being able to keep track of or control of their dogs.  Both of them happened while I was walking my dog in the morning in my neighborhood. The first time, somebody left their front door open and their dog came tearing out after us, went for my dog who I scooped up and put on top of a car, then it tackled me, caused the back injury, and at that point the owner&#39;s boyfriend came and got it off me. </p>

<p>About 3 weeks after that, I was hobbling along, because walking was a complete pain at that point, and I rounded the corner with my dog and there was a very small woman with a very big dog that was already straining at the leash.  It was snapping at us and going pretty crazy, and I could see that she was already realizing that she was going to drop the leash soon.  I tried to back up with my dog, told her to hang on to that leash because I was already injured, and that&#39;s pretty much when she let go of the leash. Kind of comically, like a cartoon, where she just let go with both hands and through both her hands wide. </p>

<p>So I got between my dog and that dog, that dog knocked me over, bit me on the arm a couple times, and then she managed to pull it off of me by the leash.</p>

<p>She left me there on the sidewalk and booked it with her dog.  I was pretty much just laying there screaming in agony until a neighbor came and got me help.  </p>

<p>I don&#39;t know who that lady was, but I haven&#39;t seen her walking the dog anywhere on our street or block since and if I do see her I have some medical bills that she needs to answer for.  </p>

<p>I also carry dog mace now.</p>

<div class="md"><p>Completely agree with this. I‚Äôd like to add that I‚Äôve also had addition success with trigger point therapy and core strengthening! Stretching is good for lengthening the muscles, but oftentimes, lower back pain comes from tightening or weakness of those same muscles. Trigger point therapy actually helps release the tightness and strengthening keeps the problem from coming back over and over again</p>

<div class="md"><p>Chiropractors are generally pretty good at fixing problems stemming from injuries or misalignment (back pain), but when they start saying they can fix everything wrong with you by adjusting your back I&#39;d be worried.</p>

<p>My current chiropractor claims that he might be able to fix problems like energy, sleep, reflux and digestion etc because if your spine is misaligned it can &quot;block&quot; your nervous system, I can kind of see how that could be related and lead to all sorts of problems but I don&#39;t really believe him. I&#39;m only there for back pain and mobility though, anything else is a bonus.</p>

<div class="md"><p>That&#39;s super bad for your back and will further atrophy the muscles that stabilize your spine. Barring a serious injury(I hope that&#39;s not the case) with chronic pain, exercise is almost always the answer. My doctor treated me with steroids and a muscle relaxer followed up with some everyday stretches and light exercises to reduce my pain. I&#39;m down to an Aleve every morning. I only put a brace on if I know I&#39;m going to do some heavy lifting. You should check with a physician for a personalized treatment plan but you&#39;ll most likely be referred to a physical therapist if there isn&#39;t a serious injury of some sort. </p>

<p>I implore you to seek out assistance for back troubles if you haven&#39;t already. The longer it goes untreated, the longer the recovery will be.</p>

<p>Seriously though, I&#39;ve had to do PT 5 times because each doctor says a good PT would help and I just had to find the right one. I went in to this new PT and told them my exact grievances with the previous ones. They of course said they would never do that and did the exact thing I warned about. After that I would get off the bike after the ten minutes and go looking for them, but then I became the annoying client and the PT started get more aggressive with my stretches to make me uncomfortable as her sort of payback.</p>

<div class="md"><p>One thing I&#39;ll always say for a problem like that is to go a doc in sports medicine. In my experience MDs always err on the side of caution, even orthopaedists, unless they spend time treating athletes. They&#39;ll have more experience with these types of patients and won&#39;t just say to stop doing it. If the sports doc/PT say its time to hang it up, then it probably is time. As for shoulder injuries, its one of the most common in heavy lifting, though you can sometimes get around it with specialized barbells and shoulder training.</p>

<div class="md"><p>Yeah, don‚Äôt ever let chiros adjust your neck, they can very easily fuck up the rest of your life with one wrong move. If they‚Äôre telling you that they can fix your cold by cracking your back they‚Äôre full of shit. If they say hey maybe cracking your back will help it feel better in tandem with stretches and exercises they may be beneficial. Make no mistake though, the latter chiros are much rarer to find.</p>

<div class="md"><p>The body stores trauma and tension in all sorts of weird ways. Some people view the body like a car where each part does a specific thing, but it‚Äôs not quite so simple. I‚Äôve had great luck with chiropractic work and it‚Äôs improved my back and neck pain significantly. Acupuncture, while I haven‚Äôt tried it, has been practiced for thousands of years. Chances are it does some good for some people. I don‚Äôt think either are one and done solutions. Like most therapies, it takes months if not years to see results. Dude above only went once and look how happy he is. Rather than go back and have a deeper conversation with the practitioner like an adult, he just wrote it off as pseudoscience and completely accepts the pain in his neck. The spine carries all sorts of nerves all across your body. Someone attempting to fix your jacked up back may not get it right the first time when you have a lifetime of wonkiness built up in there.</p>

<div class="md"><p>Something that doesn&#39;t sit well with me is how can you convey this sort of tension and pain to a chiropractor and to be able to have them understand it properly and diagnose it without actually being able to <em>see</em> what is happening inside.</p>

<p>It seems kind of strange to me and it&#39;s hard to put any kind of trust into that understanding.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t deny at all how incredibly complex the human body is, that&#39;s what makes it all seems even more ridiculous.</p>

<p>A lot of people absolutely swear by it though</p>

<div class="md"><p>It‚Äôs not a cereal box top degree. They study the body and principles that hold it all together for 3+ years. Our muscles and skeletons depend a lot on equal and opposite balance. If you say x hurts it means something may actually be wrong with it‚Äôs opposite y. I‚Äôm sure there‚Äôs all sorts of nuances and quirks they pick up in school and through practice, but there‚Äôs nothing I‚Äôve been able to throw at my chiropractor that he hadn‚Äôt seen before and had a technique line up to help. </p>

<p>Yes, I have had adjustments that left me hurting a bit, but I go back the next day or week and tell him what‚Äôs up, and he fixed it. He also has an X-ray from my first visit so he‚Äôs not totally flying blind. I would be interested to see how things have improved/changed over the years. </p>

<p>There was one lady I went to briefly that was a chiro/nutritionist/holistic practitioner and was amazing. She did a DNA test and was able to explain a lot of things I dealt with and how they related to nutrition. The only reason I didn‚Äôt go all in with her methods is that she didn‚Äôt accept insurance.</p>

<p>I think we give western doctors too much credit. They‚Äôre not all-knowing, all-fixing sages, nor can anyone really be. That‚Äôs why there are so many specialties, and often they experiment with different treatments until they find one that works. Chiropractors just happen to specialize in experimenting with manual manipulation of the spine and extremities.</p>

<div class="md"><p>Both are the evidence based I don‚Äôt know where you got your information. Acupuncture is even used in rehab facilities at the Mayo Clinic because it helps relieve stress. One of the doctors noted on several occasions he has witnessed ‚Äútough eggs‚Äù break down in tears at a seemingly unrelated location using a small needle in an emotional cleansing type of event. He also said in the same talk that for mental illness it has shown unexpected efficacy using the needles in the forehead, upper lip, and ears. He said that spending years studying the body broken into parts has caused him to have trouble accepting the bodies‚Äô natural energy fields as science, yet once he saw it in practice he can‚Äôt help but agree that there‚Äôs an important health connection between the body‚Äôs shell and its circulatory system that is extremely strong, elusive, and stubborn.  I just googled him on YouTube to see if I could show you, or find him in a paper, but I must have got his name wrong. There is evidence though in paper form from many trials if you look it up.</p>

<div class="md"><p>A year of working from home with a laptop led to some unbearable pain. </p>

<p>When I&#39;d finally had enough, I bought a desk, an ergonomic desk chair and made a little lap desk, so now I had no excuse; either sit at a desk with lovely support or sit on the sofa with the laptop much, much higher to prevent hunching over the keyboard.</p>

<p>Looking down seemed to be the cause of it all, and as soon as I stopped straining my neck to look down at a screen, the pain disappeared pretty quickly.</p>

<p>Hopefully this helps someone.</p>

<p>Take care of your back. It may seem like it&#39;s fine, but in ten years all of that bad posture <strong>WILL</strong> catch up with you. An ounce of prevention is worth a penis of cure.</p>

<div class="md"><p>Don&#39;t stop and do them every day. IDK you, but so many people half ass physical therapy and just give up. Do them every day and in weeks, but most likely months, and most cases should feel as good as new. This obviously doesn&#39;t apply to people with blown out discs and other more severe problems.</p>

<div class="md"><p>I enjoy exercising so I&#39;m sticking to twice a day as suggested! I knew a friend who was a kinesiologist that changed jobs because she didn&#39;t find it very rewarding given that most didn&#39;t do the exercises which is kind of disappointing. If anything I want more to do because i dont find some of them challenging.</p>

<div class="md"><p>Was the strangest thing. My lower back started feeling horrible out of nowhere. For almost a year. Didn&#39;t keep me from doing things or playing sports but I just didn&#39;t sleep as well and was always in pain. I just kind of accepted that that&#39;s what life was now. Then I got covid and was in bed for a week was a point where my whole body was uniformly covered in aches, pains, and chills. After covid I went back to work. Took me about 2 weeks to realize my back had completely gotten better. The pain had gone away as the pain from covid left and I just didn&#39;t notice. it&#39;s been months since then and it&#39;s still fine. Strange.</p>
