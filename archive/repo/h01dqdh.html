<div class="md"><p>I get Botox for my migraines and one of the places is in my jaw. A few weeks after the first round in my jaw I had yawned and heard a pop. The pain got increasingly worse by the next day and at that time I spent most of my day talking to clients which made it 384,584,394 times worse. Ended up having to go to the ER to make sure it didn‚Äôt pop out of place. Good news, it didn‚Äôt. Bad news, liquid diet for a week.</p>

<p>I was working in the garden yesterday and after finishing I sat in my chair with a beer and catalogued all the parts that hurt.
I realised that the majority of my aches and pains weren&#39;t from the gardening, but actually old injuries that had occurred in my 20s and 30s. The ankle from a game of drunken tennis (sound familiar?), the twisted knee from falling down a river bank, the shoulder from biking, etc.</p>

<p>All relatively minor injuries that took a week or two to recover from. It seems that they may have left an imprint that&#39;s lasted.</p>

<div class="md"><p>Sometimes. I had a great grandmother and a great aunt who both died pretty much fully cognizant of the world around them. But yeah, most people in my family have their minds go before the body does. Sometimes there is a long period of several years of dementia before death.</p>

<div class="md"><p>Some people are taking this as their bodies being more prone to injury (which is true) but my initial take was that some people get old but never leave high school or something along those lines.</p>

<p>I‚Äôm young so I‚Äôm not as good at recognizing it but there‚Äôs definitely older people out there who get along with 20 somethings because they‚Äôve never really aged out of that phase.</p>

<div class="md"><p>That&#39;s for sure. Pre April of 18 I was running 6 miles a day working out 4x a week, etc etc,  down 30# from my current weight. In April 18 I tore my posterior tibial tension which led to months of limping around in casts and walking boots and PT (which didn&#39;t help). Finally start getting back into it and in Oct 19 I get smashed between a forklift and a semi trailer. Which again put the brakes on. Then last summer had weird episode one morning, turned out my blood sugar was 500+, surprise I&#39;m diabetic, A1C of 11.8. Turns out my blood sugar was over 400 when I got squished, but nobody said anything, so who knows how long I had been fucked up for prior. That&#39;s been a party in itself as I seem to be too stupid/busy to get serious about it so a recent diabetic eye exam says that either I figure it the fuck out or I&#39;m going to go blind. Immediately following the initial diagnosis I was able to get my A1C down to 7.2, but must have gotten bored with living because I&#39;m back up to 9.1. It would be better/easier if I wasn&#39;t working 6-7 12&#39;s and stressed out.</p>
