<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>As the title suggests my doctor thinks I&#39;m taking drugs. </p>

<p>Over the past few months(6-7months) I have gone from 157lbs to 190lbs. However I&#39;ve gained little to no fat. Went to see my doctor as I do every 6 months and they were shocked at the change. Did my blood work and they checked everything including my testosterone levels. To there suprise I had as they put it,&quot;unusually high levels&quot;. </p>

<p>Now in all honesty this is just a post to brag and share as motivation to all on this process of betterment. Here is what give credit to for such high levels. </p>

<p>1) Plant based eating habits</p>

<p>2) daily weight/bodyweight exercise </p>

<p>3) 6-8hrs of rest daily</p>

<p>4)30mins or more meditation </p>

<p>5)SR </p>

<p>6) High expectations</p>

<p>7) Goal setting</p>

<p>All of these things feed off each other and I do believe them to be the cause of the high T 
27.8 nmol/L, 653 pmol/L free T respectively.</p>

<p>Are you vegan/vegetarian? </p>

<p>Do you take whey protein? Is it necessary? </p>

<p>Thanks</p>

<div class="md"><p>I’m no vegan (they eat processed foods and soya-basically an estrogen bomb) I eat just plants. For instance lentils, quinoa, hemp seeds and such.
No I don’t use whey. Plants are all you need. </p>

<p>I know it sounds strange but brother just do as I’ve suggest. You turn into a superhuman. I cannot make this up.</p>

<div class="md"><p>My dad is always concerned that I’m not getting enough protein and nutrients when plant based. Do you know if I can still gain weight on this diet? I’m pretty skinny but I know that plant based and SR will do wonders.</p>

<div class="md"><p>You mean want to watch „The Game Changers“. It is a great documentary about plant-based athletes. It’s a myth that you won’t get enough nutrients or protein. The opposite is true.</p>

<div class="md"><p>Soy only has a bit of phytoestrogens. Even as a dude, they are necessary for your bone health and sexual functions. You need to drink a gallon of soy milk everyday for months to see an impact on T levels. Don&#39;t believe the meat shills.</p>

<div class="md"><p>You don’t need to eat processed foods to be vegan mate. Or soy. And like the other guy said, they have phytoestrogens. Actually beneficial for you unlike the real mammalian estrogen you get from drinking milk and eating cheese</p>

<div class="md"><p>have you ever tried wholefood. I think if you eat the right things it can be even more beneficial. Bone marrow is incredibly nutritious and so are eggs. In this age people only eat the muscle of the animal.</p>
