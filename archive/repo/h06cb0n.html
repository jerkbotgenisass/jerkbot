<div class="md"><p>I have a much weaker mind-muscle connection with my left chest. In fact it&#39;s so weak I can&#39;t even fully contract it. Consequently, after almost 1 year of lifting, my left chest is much smaller than my right chest and the imbalance looks weird.</p>

<p>Is there any way to improve mind-muscle connection with my left chest or is this just genetics and I can&#39;t do anything about it?</p>
