<div class="md"><p><strong><em>Should I be doing the Brad Pitt workout routine when I&#39;m not very strong?</em></strong></p>

<p>The workout: <a href="https://www.highsnobiety.com/p/brad-pitt-fight-club-workout/">https://www.highsnobiety.com/p/brad-pitt-fight-club-workout/</a><br/>
The routine includes high reps, usually 15, and increasing weight on each set. There are some exceptions to different exercises.<br/>
I was doing stronglifts 5x5 before. However, I switched because I want to burn a lot more fat off my body and also because I want to have a leaner more shredded look rather than really big.<br/>
I can manage the cardio ok, but I&#39;m not doing anywhere near the weight that Pitt was doing for the role. Is it unwise to do this routine with my current strength levels, or should I focus more on lower reps to build up muscle first?<br/>
For example:<br/>
The bench press routine Brad Pitt did is -  25, 15, and 8 reps at 165, 195, 225 lbs and I am currently doing like 55 - 66 - 88 lbs.<br/>
And My incline bench is 15 reps at 44-50-55 lbs compared to Pitt&#39;s 80, 100, 130 lbs<br/>
Sorry if my weights are weird numbers, I&#39;m used to using KG.<br/>
Any help and advice would be much appreciated. Thanks!</p>
