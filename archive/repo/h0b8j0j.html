Is there any research/evidence that shows drinking cold water is harmful to the body?

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I&#39;m Asian and my parents always tell me not to drink cold water, especially in the mornings, because it&#39;s harmful to the body. When I ask how it&#39;s bad, they say things like drinking cold water constricts blood vessels or something along that line. I don&#39;t believe them but I don&#39;t have any science to back it up either.</p>

<div class="md"><p>That is simple common sense.</p>

<p>Cold water must be warmed up to body temperature or it would kill you from the inside. </p>

<p>Have you ever gotten cold water on your skin or hair? It can be very uncomfortable. In fact, people die all the time from soggy cold clothes causing hypothermia. Have you ever noticed how uncomfortable being in a rainstorm is? Your clothes become cold and wet, you shiver, maybe get sniffles, etc. </p>

<p>In traditional Europe there was also folk wisdom not to eat cold fruit or drink cold liquids, especially in winter. The body is a heat engine, always maintaining itself at 37 degrees celsius no matter what. That takes a lot of energy. Cold water is very harmful to heat. It is the same way that in the winter you will die a lot quicker from cold if you go in the river than if you just stay in the dry air. The water is colder than the rest of the world.</p>

<p>On the other hand hot liquids are the opposite. Like going in a sauna or a hot tub or jacuzzi. The warmth soaks in, into your bones some might say. I guess since we are 80% water, wet heat is easily absorbable to us. Think of it like calories in and calories out. When you are cold, you are spending more calories (heat energy) trying to maintain your body temperature. When you are warm, you spend less. Which is why a hot bath is very relaxing but a cold river is lethal. Too much cold, especially cold water, is lethal. I would guess that cold solids are even more lethal than cold liquid. Imagine filling your belly with ice cream. Thats a lot of matter your body needs to magically raise to 37 degrees celsius. Your body doesnt have a fire inside of it so how does it heat the matter? Im not sure, probably small chemical reactions, which cost energy and elements from your body, and produce warmth. So every time you consume cold stuff in order to maintain homeostasis your body actually sacrifices parts of itself to warm it up.</p>

<div class="md"><p>Also, for some insight on why old people would hold such beliefs: for most of history, people struggled for warmth. They did not have central heating, perfect insulation, or easy sources of heat for food. They did not have hot showers or cheap easy hot food constantly. Additionally, they spent a lot of time outside in the cold. They would have been very cold inside as well. Hence their fear of any additional sources of cold. Another big factor is that a lot of people sterilized their water by boiling it, so they may have seen cold water as unhygienic.</p>

<div class="md"><p>Also the thing to understand about science is that it&#39;s very subjective. Some people take hot showers, others take cold showers. Presumably a cold shower produces more testosterone, according to scientific studies. But everyone with an ounce of common sense knows that hot showers feel really good. When people rely entirely on lab results to determine their choices they stop trusting their own senses and instead follow some very pigeonholed lab study like its the word of God. That is what I call religious fundamentalism. And it is what leads to bizarre stuff like lobotomies and radioactive condoms because people believe anything that &quot;science&quot; (greek for knowledge) claims. Next time you get a cold, try for yourself and see if some hot soup or cold soup makes you feel better. That is real science - trial and error, rather than blindly obeying someone else&#39;s claims.</p>
