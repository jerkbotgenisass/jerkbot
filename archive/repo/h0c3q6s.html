<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I’ve been working out at the gym for a year just doing regular isolated muscle workouts.
Seeing no major difference on my body. 
I am looking to make major improvements, when someone in the sub recommended me the 5x5..</p>

<p>Looking to start this workout routine and sticking with it to see if I’m able to look better.</p>

<p>I’m just kinda confused 
I know it’s 5 sets 5 reps per workout 
But I’m confused on the weight i should do for those 5 sets.</p>

<p>I normally do 4 sets 12 reps. Start with two lighter weight and work my way up to heavy weights in the last three sets going for 8-10 reps.</p>

<p>So this 5x5 is new to me
Just need a little clear up on how to do this..</p>

<p>Thank you and sorry for posting so much on this sub i just started keto two weeks ago and excited to make this change in my life.</p>

<p>I’m 5’9 175lb 27yo
Although i may not look fat with a shirt on but without it i kinda do.</p>

<p>Currently eating 1500 calories.. seeing if this works out.</p>

<p>Edit: will this help me gain more muscle mass definition better than 
5 workouts per muscle 
5 sets 
10-12 reps?</p>

<div class="md"><p>I&#39;m new to keto but I have been into lifting for bodybuilding and powerlifting for 25 years.  </p>

<p>I started my weight lifting journey with the 3 sets of 12 to 15 reps.  For about a year at age 19 I could put on muscle and strength for sure.    </p>

<p>As you get conditioned your target range becomes a few less reps for sure.   So 8 to 10 reps should be a target.  </p>

<p>Some people prefer 4 sets on an exercise.    Based on genetics of body type and muscle fiber type you have creatine/bun ratio that blood work shows.   The mix of mesomorph, Endo, ecto etc.   Fast and slow twitch fibers.    </p>

<p>I have done 5x5.  10x10.  3 rep powerlifting.   But for me to feel and look the best I superset with back to back training  e.g.  chest and back..  and I pyramid (increase weight on each set). And I like to reverse pyramid ( decrease weight on each set ) to get the pump and blood flow etc</p>

<p>5x5 is for power.  Do it for a month and write down track your progress.   Shock your body with higher reps, different types of frequency, reps, weight, sets, tempo, speed of concentric and eccentric movements.</p>
