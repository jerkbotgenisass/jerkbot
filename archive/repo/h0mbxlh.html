I can’t get past 145 bench after 4 months of lifting. What am I doing wrong?

<div class="md"><p>I would stay away from testing your 1 rep max every workout, mainly to prevent a trip to Snap City.  </p>

<p>You need more volume, you&#39;d be better off doing sets of 5-12. You&#39;ll break 150 for reps if you&#39;re eating enough and lifting a higher volume.</p>

<div class="md"><p>When you want to put on strength, you don&#39;t want to do high volume. You do low volume higher weight, for example 5x5</p>

<div class="md"><p>Lol...</p>

<p>Since you obviously have no idea what you&#39;re talking about you should probably look up how powerlifters train</p>

<div class="md"><p>I haven&#39;t lifted in 3-4 years because of life, but I used to DL 525, squat 375, and bench 280ish</p>

<p>I always lifted for hypertrophy, hence why I did high reps, but we both know this is useless information when you can just Google hypertrophy workout science and obviously see that&#39;s what high reps are for.</p>

<p>I&#39;m not sure why you are choosing to die on a hill that is so obviously wrong all it would take is 5 minutes of research lmao</p>

<p>The fucking irony. </p>

<p>I&#39;ve barely even said anything in this exchange. It&#39;s all you buddy.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I haven&#39;t lifted in 3-4 years</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So why are you parading around talking like you&#39;re an expert?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I always lifted for hypertrophy, hence why I did high reps</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So, you achieved your lifts -- which weren&#39;t bad -- doing mainly high rep &quot;hypertrophy&quot; work? </p>

<p>Do you see the hole in your argument? </p>

<p><em>You</em> -- you you, the person I&#39;m talking about, not some theoretical person -- <em>got strong</em> by doing volume work. And here you are, telling someone to do less volume because ... that&#39;s how you build strength? Because Google it? Because Science? </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Google hypertrophy workout science</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Funny, because <a href="https://www.strongerbyscience.com/hypertrophy-range-fact-fiction/">here&#39;s an illuminating read</a> from an ever-so-slightly Google search. </p>

<p>Don&#39;t know who Greg Nuckols is? He&#39;s a certified big-and-strong guy, and one of the most respected names in the game right now. Maybe you missed him in your 3-4 years away from lifting.</p>

<p><a href="https://twitter.com/GregNuckols/status/1109876596310183938?s=20">Here&#39;s another take of his</a>: </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Lazy programming tip:</p>

<p>Take any generally decent hypertrophy program, add 2-3 heavy singles (RPE 7-9ish) before the volume work for your main lifts, and you have yourself a pretty good year-round strength program for intermediate lifters.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So ... Greg Nuckols is saying: Most hypertrophy programs (high volume) are also pretty good strength programs. As long as you do some heavy strength work, as well.</p>

<p>It&#39;s also funny that you told me to check out how powerlifters train -- because pretty much all of them train with high volumes <em>at least some of the time</em> these days.</p>

<p>A variety of other programing/training methods reflect this modern thinking on it. They either periodize different blocks/phases -- volume/hypertrophy/accumulation, intensity/strength/realization, and then peaking or power phases. (Juggernaut, generic block periodization, old-school linear periodization, lots of other &quot;named&quot; programs that are just different implementations of these.)  </p>

<p>Others (5/3/1, GZCL, daily undulating periodization, etc) use some kind of concurrent periodization strategies, where you have heavy days and volume days, and do a lot of accessories.</p>

<p>And, from the years of reading progress posts and meet reports and  the dailies in <a href="/r/weightroom">/r/weightroom</a> and all kind of crap -- it&#39;s pretty obvious that the vast majority of strong people train with quite a bit of volume -- at least some of the time. And that  5x5 programs that just add weight every week stall out pretty quickly.</p>

<p>So, yeah. The. Fucking. Irony. Too bad you didn&#39;t do five minutes of research before talking shit. A lot of good stuff has been written about this stuff in the last 3-4 years while you&#39;ve been gone.</p>
