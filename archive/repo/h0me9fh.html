<div class="md"><p>You’re going to want to hit pwo hard the morning of the shoot. Get in a super solid 2 hour workout and focus on getting the most insane pump you can get. Maybe wear a sweater and sweat pants so you’ll sweat a lot more. Do not eat the night before or on the day of the shoot until the scene is done.</p>

<p>Once the cameras are done you can go home knowing that it didn’t matter because they are just gonna touch it up in post production</p>
