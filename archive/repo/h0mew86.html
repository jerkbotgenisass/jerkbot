<div class="md"><p>I’ve been going to them gym hard for around 9 months now and don’t see as noticeable progress in my back as other parts of my body. I can lift more in back exercises and can see a noticeable difference in my delts but I feel like my lats and mid back are far from what resembles a Doreto shape. How long does it take for that silverback gorilla triangle to start to show. Does it really only show in a cut or is it a matter of time like everything else?</p>

<div class="md"><p>The muscle will be there once you’ve built it. While that may not sound helpful, no one can really tel you how long it’s going to take to build whatever is your idea of a big back. It just takes a lot of good training sessions over time.</p>

<div class="md"><p>The back is probably the hardest muscle to establish a mind muscle connection with since you can’t see it. Lower the weights and focus on squeezing the target muscle. Don’t just move the weight.</p>
