<div class="md"><p>Note: After rewatching the video I noticed two glaring issues</p>

<ol>
<li>In the first clip, my knees wobble as I go down, which I didn&#39;t notice when lifting. Any recommendations to avoid this?</li>
<li>In the second clip, my knees flare inward/cave in as I go down, which also didn&#39;t notice while lifting. Any tips to avoid these issues?</li>
</ol>

<p>Thanks, everyone.</p>

<div class="md"><p>Your knees should always go outwards when you squat, so To fix your knees caving in just consciously make sure they move away from your center line as you go down into the squat.</p>

<p>When you’re making adjustments to your squat (or literally any movement), focus on one thing at a time. If you want to fix your knees caving in, have some days where you literally only focus on your knees moving correctly and nothing else.</p>

<div class="md"><p>Best advice I can give you: learn how to squat without any weights first. Your squat is not good and  you might get injured. your knees should never ever go in front of your toes basically your knees need to stay in the same place. Put your butt a bit more back to achieve this. Practice this first see some videos on YouTube. Make sure to feel all the weight on your heels, get your butt and core tight when squatting there should be absolutely no wiggles. Good luck.</p>

<div class="md"><p>This is terrible advice, where do I even begin. Squatting without weights is pointless when op can squat absolutely fine with a barbell and progress. How is he supposed to strengthen the muscles responsible for squatting without exposing them to resistance? Second. Knees absolutely can go over the toes, this is a myth, your knees go over your toes when you walk down stairs, should we not do that? Third, if you told a new lifter to “get your butt and core tight” would that give them all the information they need them to brace their core effectively for a squat? Absolutely not. “Dude just make your core tight” “thanks man, now I’ve taken a deep breath into my stomach, braced into it like I was about to take a punch to the gut, I’m pulling down on the bar into my back to stabilise the spine with the lats and depressed scapula, you helped a bunch!” New lifters don’t know what “make your core tight” means, it’s so vague. Finally, lifting with an empty barbell with sub optimal technique is never going to injure even an elderly woman, never mind a fit young male. Squatting 4 plates under lots of accuse fatigue can injure someone even if they have this so called “perfect form” that everyone spends years searching for by lifting the empty barbell and making no progress. OP - get on a program and make some progress, you are at a fantastic starting point, don’t over think it</p>

<div class="md"><p>Thanks a ton for constructive criticism. Do you recommend any specific videos to help improve my technique? So far, I&#39;ve only watched and referred to this <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dW5-C1fsMjk&amp;t=21s">video</a>.</p>

<div class="md"><p>Don’t listen to that guy. Anyone who says you knees shouldnt move forward is for sure an ultra low skill strength athlete and shouldn’t be listened to.</p>

<p>check this one out. After you have it perfect then try to implement weights. Also from your video I can see that you should spread your legs a bit more.</p>
