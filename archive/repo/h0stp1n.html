Sudden pain in lateral epicondyle. Sign of tennis elbow developing?

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I‘ve been doing calisthenics for 2.5 years now. Started focusing on FL and Planche around 6 months ago, 4 workouts a week. Never had any elbow problems, I did/do have wrist tendinitis though. </p>

<p>Around 3 weeks ago I went bouldering/rock climbing. Since that day, all of the sudden I have a slight discomfort in the lateral epicondyle on my left elbow. It‘s not super painful or very restricting but I am concerned that this might be a tennis elbow developing. I do not want to risk too much as I‘ve done it back then when I started having wrist pain and I didn‘t listen to my body, making my wrist pain a long term thing.</p>

<p>I took a picture of my left elbow to show exactly the area that is painful. </p>

<p>It is not a constant pain. It comes and goes, independent if I workout or not. I took a week off from working out last week, but it didn‘t change anything. The pain is not sharp, it‘s a dumb pain / discomfort, I feel like it‘s more apparent when I do not workout. 
I actually asked an ortho 2 weeks ago about it (I had an appointment for my wrist, I got a steroid shot to treat the pain) and he did a quick  test if I have tennis elbow by having me spread my middle finger and my pointing finger while he tried to push my arm down and I had to resist that. It was negative as I had no pain doing that. He did not really do anything else about it. 
Does anybody have an idea what it could be and if I should not workout? I do not really have pain while working out, maybe at the very beginning but only slightly and then it‘s fine. I do not know what to do. Could it just be a small injury from rock climbing? Any advice appreciated.</p>

<div class="md"><p>Yes you understood correctly, oddly I feel pain in the mentioned elbow area WHILE doing the external shoulder rotation warmup. The pain doesn‘t stay though, it goes back to the baseline (I‘d say my pain is 1-2 on a scale to 10 in my lateral epicondyle), but I honestly feel like the pain is more noticeable when I do NOT workout (for example yesterday evening after my workout), but during my workout I basically do not have any pain at all (apart from the warmup). </p>

<p>You‘re right, I never really applied „progressive overload“ to my wrist curls, since I started over a year ago I only do 3 sets of 20 wrist curls with a red resistance band, I never improved on it. So if I understood you correctly, I should do the wrist curls to failure and beyond with negatives and see if that helps with my elbow? Since this might be taxing, do you recommend doing it as a warmup for my Planche workout or should I do this exercise afterwards to not interfere with the workout performance?</p>

<p>EDIT: I also ordered an elbow sleeve to stabilize it a during my workout, is that a recommended approach as long as I have pain to not make it worse?
I‘m also thinking of ordering a TheraBand Flexbar to work on a potential Tennis elbow or to at least prevent it. I used such a bar during my physical therapy back then. Would you recommend such flexbar in my case or should I literally only work on wrist extensions?</p>

<div class="md"><p>I&#39;m curious of your exact form on band external rotations, you might be using the flexors somehow. Do your wrist&#39;s curl in at the end of the movement? Yes you&#39;re understanding me correctly, go to failure, then negatives post failure. And then attempt to progress in reps or resistance over time, the progression should go fairly quickly as it&#39;s likely very underdeveloped. There are advantages to doing it either before or after so try out each and see what benefits you most. The extensors are unlikely to contribute at all during the planche and the pump will likely make the movement feel more comfortable. However, you might find yourself more capable of focusing on the lift if its done on it&#39;s own afterwards. Short term even if you drop performance, fixing the pain will more than overcompensate by securing your future progress.Try both and do whatever feels right, but really all that matters is just doing the training very aggressively. If I were you I&#39;d train them everyday for at least a few sets. To make progression super easy, take a day off if you regress in performance for more than 3 sessions, and train harder if you plateau for more than 3 sessions.</p>

<p>One more thing, it may be that some of your training is lightly taxing the extensors, just to a much lesser degree then your flexors. This would explain why you feel better when your warmed up or feel worse when your not fatigued.</p>

<p>Edit: just saw your edit lol. I&#39;m of the opinion that you shouldn&#39;t really need any equipment, the sleeve might not hurt, but most people using these things are just compensating for imbalances they don&#39;t realize they have. I say save your money and delay the order for a bit, just try out the extensor work for a while and see if all your issues wash out without any other intervention. If your still having issues after the extensor work I&#39;m more then happy to help you resolve them with other exercises before you buy some product. Im very against most purchases for pain as they dont do much and tend to be expensive, so I really couldn&#39;t advise you to buy anything with a good conscience. Literally only wrist curls should be enough. In the event that doesn&#39;t work, you could do finger extensions using some rubber bands around your fingers. That said I&#39;ve yet to meet anyone who needed to do anything but the wrist curls for similar or worse levels of pain. Thers are also other far less likely causes, but until you rule out extensor work theres no real point in pursuing then.</p>

<div class="md"><p>I do use the wrist flexors at the end of the movement when doing external rotation exercises with my shoulders. I will focus to not do that later on my workout and see if it feels better. I will also try pushing myself with the wrist curls to see if it improves. I‘ll give a feedback on how it goes.</p>

<p>There are a few things I want to point out though just in case they’re important:  -I do my Planche workout only on parallettes, which means I use more the wrist flexors than extendors.  -I use wrist wraps to stabilize my wrists when I do any sort of Planche progressions.  -The pain in my elbow literally started on the day after my rock climbing. As I said I never had problems in there before. Could it just be a small tear or something like that because it appeared all of the sudden after that day?</p>

<p>As to to the wrist sleeve: My thought process was to get one as long as the pain exists because I was afraid that it was a sign of tennis elbow and I did not want to let it get worse while working out. </p>

<p>Also I am curious, are you a PT or something as you seem to know what you’re talking about?</p>

<div class="md"><p>Not a PT and quite frankly I don&#39;t trust or respect the institution, although I did intend to become one at one point in my life.</p>

<p>Rather, I&#39;m an extremely self educated trainer and health coach with a lot of personal experience treating joint issues in myself and the people I train. I built my knowledge base by trying to resolve health problems and joint issues in people I cared about after mainstream medical practitioners (many of whom were PTs) took tons of their money and accomplished nothing. I actually was officially educated to be a research scientist, but im transitioning towards coaching people for health problems and injuries full-time as I find it much more impactful then the research I was doing.</p>

<p>Although its controversial,  I strongly advise you to never consider physical trauma as a cause of any joint pain, as the connection is not nearly as clear as you might think, here&#39;s a study that really puts that into <a href="https://academic.oup.com/painmedicine/article/18/4/736/2924731">perspective</a>. I also made a video on shoulder rehab that begins with an explanation on the shaky connection between physical trauma and joint pain <a href="https://youtu.be/kKYBvJho4lE">here</a>. Only the first half is directly relevant to you, but you might better understand my approach to general joint issues if you watch the whole thing. I hope it will help to clarify my perspective more. </p>

<p>Sudden pains are almost always due to joint misalignment through muscle imbalances. Only in  very rare circumstances is there ever any actual underlying damage (anyway, passive rest is rarely useful even in the case of damage, as careful training usually promotes proper healing). What I believe is often occurring is that a misaligned joint is sensed by the body to lack stability, then a traumatic event occurs, and a muscle can semi-permenantly spasm in response as a kind of protection mechanism. Basically to sum it up, it seems to be the case that chronic misalignment through weakness can give rise to acute pain following a near-injury, which is then followed by a more extreme misalignment which can cause chronic pain.</p>

<p>My experience is mostly what informs this belief, as I&#39;m unsure if this is mainstream PT knowledge or if others believe this to be the case. Even if I&#39;m wrong, operating under this assumption has allowed me to cure and predict the cause of many chronically painful &quot;injuries&quot; , so I imagine I&#39;m at least close enough on the underlying mechanism. </p>

<p>For example, I&#39;ve coached a teenager who had years of chronic back pain, was diagnosed with disc damage as a cause of his pain, and told he should never lift again so as to not cripple himself further. Within two weeks of hamstring training he had no pain or mobility issues at all and has since permenantly regained the ability to do whatever he wants pain-free. In his case his hip flexors spasmed during a risky deadlift attempt to compensate for extreme weaknesses in his hamstrings and glutes. This was confirmed by the fact that stretching his hip flexors gave him temporary relief, while strengthening his hamstrings and glutes fixed him permenantly. I myself first got into rehab training after heinously &quot;injuring&quot; myself in the same manner and fixing it by trial and error after struggling to even walk properly for a year. I have a lot more examples than this but I hope this is enough to get the general idea of what&#39;s going on.</p>

<p>Because your pain is almost certainly not related to damage there is nothing to do for it other than training your weaknesses. Essentially this is because there isn&#39;t any damage to prevent from worsening or any healing to speed up. Things like this only get worse if the imbalance gets worse, and only get better if the strong muscle gets untrained or the weak muscles catches up. </p>

<p>My honest opinion is that you&#39;d be wasting money on sleeves, and had I known you sooner I would&#39;ve talked you out of buying the wrist wraps for pain too. The only benefit the wraps provide you is keeping you out of flexion, but if your extensors were up to snuff you wouldn&#39;t have any issues in flexion in the first place. Equipment like that probably has a place as tool for training harder when very beat up, but this is a very narrow and specific use. </p>

<p>None of these things will necessarily harm you or detract from you, but I find that using what amounts to lifehacks to reduce pain usually prevents you from getting the lesson that the pain is trying to teach you.</p>

<p>Edit: totally forgot to mention, your pain may seen sudden but your wrist tendonitis and elbow pain are very likely the same issue manifesting differently. From that perspective your issue might seem a lot more like a sudden ramp up on a gradually increasing gradient, rather then a pain completely  coming out of nowhere.</p>

<div class="md"><p>I really appreciate that you take the time to answer so detailed, thank you.</p>

<p>I did my wrist curls pre workout yesterday and went to failure and beyond in my last set and I feel like my elbow was already much better. But as the pain is not constant it could also be a coincidence, so I will keep observing the next few workouts how well it helps. However, today already, the pain in my elbow is back. Is that to be expected? I feel like it did immediately help me yesterday but I guess I have to do the exercise more frequently for it to have a longer term effect.</p>

<p>EDIT: I haven‘t watched the linked videos yet, will do tonight when I have time.</p>

<div class="md"><p>Yeah you won&#39;t get any long term change until you at least progress a little. Still I&#39;m glad you have good first impressions, that means we&#39;re on the right track. I wouldn&#39;t be worried about overtraining by going post failure on every set, just moderate your effort based on your intuition, I find that around 3-5 negatives per set is more than enough. Really the videos and paper aren&#39;t strictly necessary, I just prefer not to give advice without extensive explanation because most of what I say is often taken to be extremely controversial. I get a lot of joy in helping people with issues like this, and so it&#39;s no trouble at all. Keep me posted over the next week or so on the relief becoming more permanent.</p>
