<div class="md"><p>My dude even in the discussions section they&#39;re agreeing with me and not you. Fuck their definition of injury is pants on head retarded:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Participants were instructed to self-determine whether an event should be considered an injury; no defined qualifiers were provided to participants.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>and them discussing this <em>insane</em> &quot;choose if something is an injury or not&quot; </p>

<blockquote>
<p>These results parallel those reported by Weisenthal et al,20 who studied injury rates and patterns among 386 CrossFit athletes. Those authors similarly found that males were more likely to sustain injuries than females (P = .03) and that shoulder and lower back were the most common locations of injury. However, the injury rate in that study was 19.4% compared with the injury rate of 60.67% found in our CrossFit cohort. <strong>In the Weisenthal et al20 study, injury was more rigorously defined to occur within the past 6 months (as opposed to 2 years in our study) and to include at least 1 of the following criteria: (1) total removal from CrossFit training or other outside routine physical activities for more than 1 week; (2) modification of normal training activities in duration, intensity, or mode for more than 2 weeks; or (3) any physical complaint severe enough to warrant a visit to a health professional.20 In our study, injury was not defined in a comparable manner due to the subjective nature of injury and subsequent pain; if a participant recalled an injury within the past 2 years, we deemed this significant enough to be included.</strong> Furthermore, in the study by Weisenthal et al,20 injury rate was significantly decreased when a trainer was involved (P = .028). The use of a trainer was not investigated in our study. Furthermore, previous injury to the same area of reported injury was not queried in our study even though 1 study of CrossFit athletes indicated that 33.3% of reported injuries sustained were exacerbations of a previous injury.</p>

<p>By their definition since I can remember every injury and tweak I&#39;ve had I&#39;ve been &quot;injured&quot; ~75 times in the last ~6 years I&#39;ve spent lifting. That puts my injury rate per 1000 hour of Strength training (Split between Oly and General Strength) at 25. Which is fucking stupid because low back tweaks =/= as tearing a trap but your study treats them as the same fucking thing. </p>

<p>I can keep going if you&#39;d like to keep harping on how the mobile site shows the introduction under the conclusion heading since that seems to be the only thing you&#39;re focusing on instead of my other points.</p>

<div class="md"><p>If you can actually <strong>remember</strong> an injury, then it’s not just a tweak. And if you are getting repeated lower back “tweaks” that are significant enough to remember you should be evaluated by an orthopedist to be on the safe side, If you have then good for you but if not I’d definitely recommend it. Repeated injuries to the same muscle group are a sign that something is fucky to use a technical term. (Meaning you may need some rehab work to strengthen core or accessory muscle groups) or it could be something like a herniated disk, or SI joint disfunction (those last two are big causes of sciatica (which is a commonly misnomer for any number of nerve impingements and or inflammation effecting the nerves which Innervate the lumbar region, hip and lower extremities)</p>

<p>But repeated “tweaks” in the same place is usually your body telling you something isn’t right</p>

<p>Edit: wait but fuck me right what do I know I’m just a dumbass with “no formal training” disregard</p>

<p>But I can <strong>remember</strong> my tweaks <strong>and</strong> injuries. They are not the same thing but this study treats them the same way. </p>

<p>I braced poorly doing Dinnies the other week and tweaked my right oblique and low back. This required me to not do pulls or Dinnies for a week but could still Squat and do everything else. </p>

<p>Was I injured or did I have a tweak? If I’m new to lifting and don’t understand that a tweak and injury aren’t the same, how do you think I’ll report it?</p>

<p>Why do you think a study that let it’s participants define injury for themselves is a good metric by which to study injury in CrossFit?</p>

<p>I can see how someone who hasn’t ever been big and strong would think this. But here’s a spoiler for you. When you’re getting big and strong you sometimes tweak something. I’ve tweaked basically every muscle in my body at one point or the other. This study would allow me to report an insane injury rate despite the fact that out of those ~75 “injuries” that I can remember only 5 of them were actual injuries.</p>

<p>That’s your own term for diminishing an injury.</p>
