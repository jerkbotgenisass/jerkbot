<div class="md"><p>I take it you have never competed in a sanctioned competition? You have different divisions. Raw-sleeves, belt, and wrist wraps (all non-assisting gear), classic raw-you can wear knee wraps which can give you a solid jump on your squat, single-ply and multiply-suit that helps you lift a fuck ton more.  USPA, RPS, USAPL, and RPS are some the biggest sanctioned feds and they all adhere to the above.</p>

<p>Why stop at sleeves and belt?</p>

<p>Raw shouldn&#39;t include shoes either. Right? Because after all barefoot would be really raw.</p>

<p>Fuck it. Might as well say no clothes either. Not having your nuts dangling in the wind is probably too much of an advantage. Just like Greco-Roman wrestling, nude lifting would be truly &quot;raw.&quot;</p>

<p>Actually, come to think of it, why do we even allow the bar to start from the stand or rack? Steinborn Squats should just be the standard. If you can&#39;t get it on your back off the floor then it doesn&#39;t count.</p>

<p>In fact, why are we letting people lift using calibrated plates? Or barbells with bushings/bearings? It should just be stones attached to a stick.</p>

<p>Raw lifting like nature intended. /s</p>

<p><strong><em>EDIT:</em></strong> </p>

<p>Despite the &quot;/s,&quot; I actually <em>am</em> curious what your response is.</p>

<p>Why are sleeves and belt so often where the arbitrary line for &quot;raw&quot; is drawn for layman but not all the other things listed?</p>

<p>I thought so too. Which is why I&#39;m bummed you didn&#39;t actually answer my question:</p>

<p>Why are sleeves and belt so often where the arbitrary line for &quot;non-raw&quot; is drawn but not all the other &quot;non-raw&quot; elements I listed?</p>

<blockquote>

<p>Just because someone responds in opposition to your opinion doesn&#39;t mean they&#39;re offended. They can just think you have a bad take. </p>

<p>So don&#39;t feel sorry for me. Instead use that energy to have a discussion with me so we can examine your preconceptions. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>ruined power lifting</p>
</blockquote>

<p>But again, how?</p>

<p>Have newer rackets ruined tennis? </p>

<p>Have newer golf balls or clubs ruined golf?</p>

<p>Has the 3-point line ruined basketball?</p>

<p>Has the forward pass ruined football?</p>

<p>Has the Nike Vaporfly ruined long distance running?</p>

<p>Have singlets ruined wrestling?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>suits wraps and belts</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Well we&#39;re not talking about suits because that wouldn&#39;t be raw. And only some powerlifting federations consider wraps &quot;raw&quot; or &quot;raw w/ wraps&quot;.</p>

<p>With that said, do you think belts and wraps have ruined Olympic Weightlifting too?</p>

<div class="md"><p>You can&#39;t change terminology that has been around since the sport started. You can&#39;t call it equipped because in all reality a belt and sleeves are not wraps and a suit.</p>
