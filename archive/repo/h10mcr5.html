<div class="md"><p>Pick a program from the wiki that better fits your schedule. PPL is good if you have 6 days a week to lift.</p>

<div class="md"><p>Who wants to lift 6 days a week though, PPL works pretty well for alot of people if you manage your fatigue and diet properly and train hard</p>

<div class="md"><p>PPL works for people lifting 6 days a week, which you say you don’t.  You would have better results using a program designed for the days you plan on lifting, not forcing a program designed for more days into another schedule.</p>

<div class="md"><p>I&#39;ve pretty successfully run PPL and a full body routine since I started to get where I am so no I&#39;m sorry but I disagree. PPL does work for less that 6 days lol</p>

<div class="md"><p>If it’s so successful, why are you here asking questions?  I get you may like the program but doing PPL for less than 6 days is objectively worse than other programs, whether it’s working for you or not.  If you want to keep running it the way you are, that’s on you, but I wouldn’t expect your physique to keep improving running the program in an inferior way.</p>

<div class="md"><p>Mate I&#39;m allowed to ask questions I appreciate your input and information but the way you deliver info just seems negative. This thread is obviously meant for asking questions if not this site as a whole...</p>

<div class="md"><p>Sure, you can ask questions but then arguing with the answers to said questions is just dumb.  You are running a program designed for 6 days in less than that.  You could be doing better and multiple people have said as much.  If you want to run a poor version of the program, fine, but it won’t help with your stated physique goal.  That’s not on me, that’s on you, and just like you get to ask the question, we get to answer and if you seem unwilling to listen, we also get to call you out on that.</p>
