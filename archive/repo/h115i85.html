<div class="md"><p>I wonder how much of a difference for muscle growth during a cut vs a bulk. I saw people say that adding 2.5 - 5 lbs each week to exercises are pretty normal, but for many exercises (especially isolated exercises) I can barely add a couple of total reps per week (I&#39;m a beginner doing a small cut). Is this expected during a cut? Or is my progression too slow compared to &quot;normal&quot;?</p>

<p>If you&#39;re new to lifting, almost none. If you&#39;ve been lifting for a while, you&#39;ll notice the difference. If you&#39;re already pretty strong, the difference is like night and day.</p>

<div class="md"><p>True but this is often a horrendous mistake once they realize their blood pressure and body fat percentage is through the roof.</p>

<div class="md"><p>Well bulking in general is a terrible idea unless you don’t care about a surge of fat in your body. The only good type of bulk is a lean bulk. </p>

<p>It’s all about the persons goal at the end of the day.</p>

<div class="md"><p>&quot;surge of fat&quot;... If people are talking about eating a massive surplus of calories they&#39;ll say <em>dirty bulk</em>, but you talk as if stuffing your face until morbid obesity is the default rather than the exception.</p>
