Trap Bar vs Sumo Deadlift

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>So talking about athletic performance here, the hip hinge Continuum, sprint speed, power development. </p>

<p>I&#39;m a really really good sumo puller. I have perfect leverages, and can pull 2.75x bodyweight with under 2 years of training there, while running a lot.  I have perfected my technique, but, I&#39;m reading a lot of stuff about how to develop speed and power you want to focus more on the trap bar deadlift, a lot of talk about the hip hinge Continuum and how trap bars are more similar to conventionals than sumo deadlifts. I can&#39;t pull conventional, and even high handle trap bars feel a bit funky and weird.  </p>

<p>Could i continue to develop my sumo deadlift and use the added load there to improve my athleticism ?</p>

<div class="md"><p>I see very little point in doing sumo whatsoever if your goal is athletic performance. It puts you through a lesser range of motion, in an extremely unnatural position. </p>

<p>The trap bar deadlift makes more sense for athletes. I don’t understand the carryover from sumo to athletic performance ? I don’t think sumo has a place in an athletes program unless they physically cannot do a conventional deadlift. Even still, if you’re trying to achieve improved speed and power for athleticism in general, neither deadlift is probably the best exercise for you.</p>
