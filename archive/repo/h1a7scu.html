<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Started lifting weights, consuming whey, and doing a 500 calorie deficit diet 3 months ago. Besides from the weight change are there any noticeable changes? Should I continue cutting or should I proceed to bulking? Also, my goal is to just get shredded. Thanks!</p>

<div class="md"><p>No visible change at all. But why would you cut with your physique?<br/>
How you think you‘re going to build muscles without a surplus?</p>

<div class="md"><p>I thought as long as I maintain my daily protein intake I can build muscles (like in recomp?). As for the cut, I thought that it would help remove my belly fat and the handles. Please educate me thanks!</p>

<div class="md"><p>As I already said: If you want to build muscles you‘ll have to be in a caloric surplus.<br/>
That’s a fact. </p>

<p>Head over to <a href="/r/Fitness">r/Fitness</a> and read through their Wiki. It will answer most if of not all of your questions.</p>

<div class="md"><p>You only need a surplus if you are already advanced, it&#39;s not the case here.</p>

<p>OP you can do recomp at the same weight, all you have to do is stay at maintenance and progressively train harder. Or you can bulk and cut again later.</p>

<div class="md"><p>So a beginner can defeat the laws of thermodynamics? Where do you think the muscle is supposed to grow from? Thin air?<br/>
FYI: Even if OP maintains their BF and adds on muscle slowly it would be a bulk </p>

<p>As for recomps: Just give me one example of a successful recomp. Just because it would work in theory doesn’t mean it’ll work in practice. If it would everybody would do it.</p>

<div class="md"><p>Building muscle =\= burning fat, 2 distinct things. So no, you are not defying the laws of thermodynamics because it&#39;s 2 separate things. As a beginner with a decent amount of BF you can build muscle at the same time as you burn fat. The protein you ingest with food will be enough to build the muscles, while the fat you have stored will be used as energy.
I didnt mentioned for OP to maintain the same BF with the same weight, I said to maintain the same weight while gaining muscle, that will lower the BF.</p>

<p>You want a successful recomp? There are plenty of cases documented, and most of them occur in beginners.</p>
