<div class="md"><p>Unless you are bed-ridden or something, it&#39;s very likely that you aren&#39;t counting accurately then. I would spend a week counting <em>everything</em> to the best of your ability. This might involved getting a food scale.</p>

<p>And no, I&#39;m not trying to say you are dumb or anything, it&#39;s just that sometimes we need a little &#39;audit&#39; of our intake. Same thing happened to me when trying to bulk early on.</p>

<p>How could I be bed ridden given the regime I described?</p>

<p>I&#39;m obviously already using a scale. When I prep my meals, I weigh each item individually. I eat the exact same thing every day. It&#39;s all low carb, low fat, highish protein, high fibre. Three meals a day around 300 cal each. Plus water, black coffee and green tea. That&#39;s all that&#39;s been going in my body for weeks now.</p>

<p>Here&#39;s my menu:</p>

<p>150g Greek yogurt, 50g raspberry, 15g chia seeds, 25g pepitas.</p>

<p>1 egg, 50g boiled lentils, 50g boiled pumpkin/sweet potato.</p>

<p>1 scoop protein powder in a half litre of water, 1 carrot, 1 cucumber, 50g of black beans.</p>

<p>So even if I&#39;m counting so badly that I&#39;m actually eating double what I think I am. That&#39;s 2,000 a day max, and I would still have a significant deficit. </p>

<p>What I&#39;m trying to find out is how to break through the plateau. The wiki says to eat less and exercise more, yet most people in this thread seem to be telling me to exercise less and eat more.</p>

<div class="md"><p>I was being facetious with the bedridden comment.</p>

<p>Again, ignore your calories burned measurements. They aren&#39;t accurate and by definition you are eating at maintenance given that your weight is not changing.</p>

<p>If you are indeed being accurate then I would seek medical advice. That would be a paltry amount of food (and protein) for your size. There is simply no way that an active 5&#39;11&quot; male weighing 205lbs is sitting at maintenance while eating 800-1000 calories. </p>

<p>My personal bet would be that your are indeed undercounting by a very large amount, for whatever reason.</p>

<p>and a condescending arsehole.</p>

<p>I&#39;m an industrial chemist. I think it&#39;s safe to say I know more than the average Joe about thermodynamics. I do heat and mass balances as a core part of my job. You think I don&#39;t know how to check the calibration of the scales? I can tell you what I&#39;m eating is correct to within a few percent by mass. You think I don&#39;t know what the calorific value is low and that the protein levels are too low? Why do you think I&#39;m trying to get out of the plateau as quickly as possible? So I can return to a maintenance diet and start eating the correct amount of protein again.</p>

<p>I&#39;m also using two different scale to record my weight, but only recording one of them. No noticeable disagreement there either. I&#39;ve checked all this already. That&#39;s not what I&#39;m asking.</p>

<p>You and others keep bringing up the calories estimation from the treadmill as if it has any relevance what so ever. I&#39;m the one saying it&#39;s completely irrelevant, but you&#39;re not listening to me and spitting out stupidly obvious information as if I don&#39;t know that already. Let&#39;s ignore exercise completely for a moment. Even if my scales were only displaying half of what the actual weight is (which of course they aren&#39;t, because I would have noticed when I pour a half litre of water into my protein powder that the weight increased by 1 kilo instead of a half kilo), doubling my calorific intake would only just get to the ballpark of my resting metabolic rate. So the specifics of what the treadmill displays is completely irrelevant. Once you add on <em>any</em> cardio on top of that, there is no mathematically possible way that I am not in a calorific deficit. The magnitude of the errors required for me to unknowingly be at maintenance would have to be hundreds of percent across multiple devices. </p>

<p>I&#39;m obviously wasting my time in this forum. No one is addressing my core question, just telling me that my experiences must be wrong and I can&#39;t count. Unless my wife is pouring half a kilo of sugar down my throat every night while I&#39;m asleep (and I&#39;m pretty sure I&#39;d notice that), my numbers are more than accurate enough for this purpose.</p>

<p>I&#39;ll go see my GP instead. Bye.</p>

<p>Explain to me then, how are you not losing weight? Honest question. You are in a caloric deficit and not losing weight, correct? So either you have single handedly dismantled the entire concept of CICO, against a mountain of evidence, or you are a special outlier to whom it doesn&#39;t apply: which one? Or is there another explanation?</p>

<p>Is literally my initial question.</p>

<p>Not all bodymass is fat. If you don&#39;t have anything productive to say, stop wasting my time.</p>
