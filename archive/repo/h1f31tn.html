<div class="md"><p>Can&#39;t gain weight and going to the gym gets difficult.  </p>

<p>I used to go to the gym and it went well - I am skinny so it was easy to become lean. I reached a point however where I was no longer gaining because I wasn&#39;t really eating enough. After a while I got sick of the same weights and tried higher weights, ended up screwing my shoulders up.  </p>

<p>Gaining weight is way harder than people think it is if you have a fast metabolism. I can eat 1 meal a day or 3 meals and I will stay the same weight</p>

<p>Edit: Please see my other comments explaining my appetite!</p>
