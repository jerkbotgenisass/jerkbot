<div class="md"><p>Am a guy who was skinny.  Some women weren&#39;t into skinny guys.  I met my wife when I was really thin, and later she let me know she was a little on the fence about it.  I am 5&#39;10&quot; and weighed 140 pounds when we met.  I was biking everywhere and living off of rice and beans.  After 14 years of better food and 10 years of weight lifting I&#39;m 190, but I&#39;m old and married and have no idea if women care.  I still look skinny but am just dense I guess.  I don&#39;t look like a skeleton anymore though.  One thing I miss, when you&#39;re really skinny, your dong looks HUGE.</p>

<div class="md"><p>I used to be in a similar boat as you. I always thought I ate alot but I think if you track your calories for a few days you&#39;ll realize you&#39;re just eating enough to maintain your current weight, which isn&#39;t enough. Some days I only eat 2000 calories or less and I feel great. Then I remind myself I need 3400 calories to gain weight as I workout and eating that much puts me in a food coma 3 times a day.</p>

<div class="md"><p>My SO is also 6&#39;3&quot; and 135 lbs. He has a very thin build. Like, you can tell his skeleton/bone structure itself is built like this. Some people have very thin skeletons. For example, put Serena Williams on a no sport ever regime and have her lose all her muscles, she&#39;s still gonna be wider than Kate Middleton. Some people just have very slender skeletons.</p>

<p>That&#39;s because it&#39;s about how they see <em>themselves</em> compared to you. Not how you see them. It&#39;s not about your opinion. So telling them you don&#39;t care and think they&#39;re hot doesn&#39;t mean anything. </p>

<div class="md"><p>I tried going to a nutritionist and it was a total waste of time. I‚Äôm already thin but a couple years ago I started rapidly dropping weight for no apparent reason. It was alarming because I was 32 at the time and had been 5&#39;3 and 110-115 pounds since I was 14, my weight hardly fluctuated at all. Suddenly I found myself weighing 93 pounds. </p>

<p>My blood work came back fine, so my doctor forced me to go to a nutritionist. Even with really good insurance I paid $140 to essentially have a dude tell me to eat more. He told me to eat at least 1600 calories per day when I already told him I was eating 1900+ using a scale and all. He told me to eat a list of specific foods‚Ä¶all of which I‚Äôd already told him were a regular part of my diet and given to him on a list I had to bring to my first appointment. He wanted me to come in twice a week at $140 an appointment just to weigh me and continue giving me the most obvious, surface level advice. And I was referred there by a major hospital, it‚Äôs not like it was some hole in the wall operation.</p>

<p>Sorry for the rant, I just hate people that exploit others that are suffering.</p>

<p>Now I know that I‚Äôm not particularly chubby, I could lose a few pounds sure, I‚Äôve got a little bit of a belly but I‚Äôm not chubby.

<div class="md"><p>It really sucks. I&#39;ve got your old bodytype, and pretty much no women are interested in skinny men. At least if I was overweight I&#39;d have better luck, the &quot;bear&quot; bodytype is fairly desirable. Like someone else mentioned, it really is because a good majority want to feel &quot;petit&quot; in comparison.</p>

<p>And of course it&#39;s the opposite with men&#39;s preference in a woman&#39;s bodytype. Skinnier women have much better luck dating than overweight women. It just sucks on both sides.</p>

<div class="md"><p>You&#39;ll find somebody.  One of my buddy&#39;s likes to point out that you can be fat and you can be old but most people don&#39;t get to be both.  He&#39;s a guy that struggles to put on weight too.  I didn&#39;t bulk up intentionally, I just got into weight lifting.  It certainly works, but I wouldn&#39;t recommend making a big lifestyle change to get women.</p>

<p>Yeah, I think you&#39;re right about that. This sounds fucking stupid (because it is), but body preferences are subject to fashion trends just like clothes are, and they&#39;ll vary a lot depending on the culture you live in and the specific subculture of people you&#39;re surrounded by. In, like, 2014, people made fun of me when I said that I was into skinny guys, but nowadays, zoomers and younger millennials don&#39;t bat an eye because eboys happened and K-pop idols are everywhere. And in the late 2000s, slim bodies were en vogue (or even obligatory lmao) for scene kids and hipsters in skinny jeans.</p>

<div class="md"><p>Hey I know how much it sucks, it took until I met my current gf to not feel ashamed of how skinny I am. I dated other people, but even the tiniest remark on my weight would cut to the bone (not far to travel either). Finding someone who will genuinely appreciate your body will do wonders for your self confidence.</p>

<p>The &quot;bear&quot; body type is desirable right now because of societal trends, but also because of a few people rocking what they got and acting confident (like Chris Pratt). And while things may be easier on the whole for skinny women, there&#39;s no denying that &quot;thick&quot; is in right now. My friends and I were watching some of the old Fast and Furious movies the other week and everyone burst out laughing at the gratuitous ass shots aimed at stick-thin women with zero junk in their trunks. They all thought it was hilarious that the look was so popular less than a decade ago, and yet it was!</p>

<p>My best advice in life is &quot;fake it till you make it&quot;. I stopped looking to buff movie stars for inspiration and started looking back at decades of rock stars who owned the skinny look, and it really helped improve my vision of myself. You may not want to look like Keith Richards or Johnny Rotten, but inspiration can come from unlikely places!</p>

You need to eat till you physically hurt then eat more. Drink calories if it&#39;s hard to eat them. Let a tub of ice cream melt every day and drink that. Then spend an hour 3 or 4x a day picking heavy stuff up and putting it back down. I was so unhappy with myself and my skinny body and thought (I eat all the time and gain nothing) until I started tracking calories and watching the scale.

<div class="md"><p>I think attitude plays a huge role. I learned from watching my fat, very unattractive cousin, who would initially repulse women, end up having multiple gorgeous girlfriends. In his mind, he was the hottest man and that confidence rubbed off on others. I adopted that as a skinny guy and did well also.</p>

<div class="md"><p>I&#39;m 5&#39;10&#39;&#39; 140lb as well. I definitely get a bit self conscious sometime because I feel like it&#39;s more desirable for men to be bigger. I&#39;ve definitely gotten better at dressing for my body shape and looking good but I do want to gain a bit of weight still. I don&#39;t necessarily need to get ripped, just like a little bit more meat on my bones.</p>
