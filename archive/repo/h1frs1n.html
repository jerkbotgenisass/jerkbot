<div class="md"><p>It&#39;s a lot more socially acceptable to insult us.   </p>

<p>Someone makes fun of a fat person if they&#39;re intentionally being mean, or if they&#39;re friends jabbing at them. It&#39;s somehow socially acceptable for a complete stranger to call you skinny.</p>

<div class="md"><p>This.</p>

<p>Nobody gives a fuck when someone tells a skinny person they need to eat more. They&#39;re basically saying &quot;you don&#39;t look right&quot;</p>

<p>And like it&#39;s that simple anyway. I have a low appetite, and small stomach. I like food, I have a very good palate, but I just can&#39;t eat much and I am still healthy so go fuck yourself to anyone who tells me to eat more.</p>

<div class="md"><p>Exactly.  Eating more just means shitting more.  And eating more junk just means we stay skinny but develop bellies and flab and look like ET.</p>

<p>I was 6&#39; at 18 and 112 lbs.  I never heard the end of it.  Everyone would constantly joke and bully and console and teach me how to not be skinny.  And it was okay because &quot;being skinny is a good thing&quot;.  If it&#39;s a good thing, why do you need me to change so badly?</p>

<p>It took me a lot of years of very <em>very</em> hard, gruelling work to get my body up to 170 lbs.  You don&#39;t get to just &quot;go to the gym&quot;.  You don&#39;t get to just &quot;eat more&quot;.  You have to lift like a fucking ox, you have to exhaust yourself beyond failure <em>routinely</em>, you have to measure and manage your diet to a tee, and you have to eat when you don&#39;t want to and force yourself to chew and chew and chew when your body tells you not to.  It makes you develop an unhealthy relationship with food.  And it took me 2 years.  I don&#39;t wish that on anybody.</p>

<p>Fuck anyone who bullies anyone based on their weight, whichever side the scale swings.</p>

<div class="md"><p>Putting on muscle on longer arms and legs with a more narrow torso and high metabolism is indeed hard af. I know your struggle. Upside is your get that lean shredded look bc (especially when working out a lot) your body carries zero fat</p>

<div class="md"><p>I had to do German volume training 2 hours a day and eat like a horse for nearly 3 months to put on 12 pounds of muscle. Less than a month to lose it all lol. At least I&#39;m slowly putting on weight now naturally. I&#39;m trying to hit 220, 55 more pounds to go ü§òüèΩ</p>
