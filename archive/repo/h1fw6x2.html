Stop Qualifying Your Results
<br/><strong>Posted by <a id="userlink" href="https://www.reddit.com/user/The_Fatalist/">The_Fatalist</a>. </strong><em>Posted at 18:20 UTC on June 10, 2021. 1020 Points. </em><em>(self.<a id="selfLink" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Fitness/">Fitness</a>)</em><em> (<a id="postpermalink" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Fitness/comments/nwujix/stop_qualifying_your_results/">Permalink</a>)</em>
<div class="post">
<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>These are all common types of questions/statements I see here and on other subs from beginners:</p>

<p>&#39;Is this a good lift for a 6&#39;/145lb/17yo lifter with mild scoliosis and a peanut allergy?&#39;</p>

<p>&#39;My lift is not very high but I also weigh very little for my height so it&#39;s good for my weight&#39; </p>

<p>&#39;Is this a good lift for a beginner who has been lifting for 178 days and 14 hours?&#39;</p>

<p>&#39;But i&#39;m the strong compared to random people off the street&#39;</p>

<p>You get the idea. </p>

<p>Some beginners seem to be very fixated on qualifying their accomplishments. Instead of just getting stronger, they want to change the context of their results to make them appear better. Links to sites like symmetricstrength are presented all the time by and in response to beginners talking about &quot;How good is X lift of mine&quot;. People ask for levels that are good for someone who has only been lifting a year, or who is 140lbs at 5&#39;11&#39;&#39; or whatever. </p>

<p>This doesn&#39;t make you strong. Dressing up your 250lb deadlift, when you have the potential for 500lb+, in any number of &quot;Well it&#39;s strong for _______&quot; does not change the fact that you have a 250lb deadlift when you can achieve a 500lb deadlift with more time, more effort, and better training. And yes, there is probably a subset of people that share some characteristics with you for which a 250lb deadlift IS strong, for which 250lbs is nearing what they can potentially do. But they know that already, they aren&#39;t asking if 250 is strong. </p>

<p>Strong people are not looking to qualify or validate their accomplishments to make them look good. They know how much work they put in to get there and know that they are strong. Everyone else needs to stop trying to find reasons for why what they are currently doing is good enough and actually work to reach their potential, if being strong is something that they are really interested in. If you do that you don&#39;t need to say &quot;I&#39;m strong <em>if you consider X Y and Z</em>&quot;, you can just say &quot;I am strong&quot;.</p>

<p>Anyways, the whole reason I made this post was to share <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UvGTlUt7Y3k&amp;ab_channel=AlexanderBromley">this video by Alex Bromley</a> that was linked on <a href="/r/weightroom">/r/weightroom</a> earlier today. I think the average user here will get more value out of this than the average user there. I didn&#39;t want to dump a link without any context. </p>

<p>And this is probably not worth saying as the kind of people likely to be guilty of this won&#39;t read this far anyways but please <em>actually watch the video</em> before commenting for or against any ideas <em>you think</em> might be presented within in. Also if you want to address a specific point please try to include a general timestamp so anyone interested can find the exact context without searching through a 20 minute video.</p>

<div class="md"><p>The one thing I&#39;ve learned from <a href="/r/fitness">r/fitness</a> is that powerlifting is an incredibly catty &#39;sport&#39;.</p>

<p>Everyone is always trying to tear each other down and shit on the people just starting out.</p>

<div class="md"><p>This shows that you have zero experience with the sport of powerlifting whatsoever. The literal opposite is true, beginner lifters who are motivated to learn and give the sport their all are always supported, encouraged and cheered on at comps and in training. Experienced lifters, coaches and officials are usually happy to give advice and answer questions. </p>

<p>And the camaraderie amongst lifters in general is amazing. It&#39;s quite common for your strongest competition to also be your biggest cheerleader at comps and give you a slap on the back as you head out to the platform.</p>

<p>The lad in the video whose video you&#39;re promoting is clearly a big fat weight lifting type.</p>

<p>You&#39;re clearly a giant overweight power lifting type.</p>

<p>I&#39;ve just observed you all love to shit on the new ones starting out and mock how weak and pathetic they are.</p>

<p>So you know nothing about the topic</p>

<p>Big yes, fat no. </p>

<p>Giant yes,<em>obese</em> yes, fat no, powerlifter no. </p>

<p>The only one here showing disdain for those that don&#39;t choose to train like they do is you. </p>

<p>I&#39;m sorry someone bigger than you shoved you in a locker or whatever but you shouldn&#39;t take it out on everyone that enjoys lifting weights.</p>

<div class="md"><p>Eh, I&#39;m sticking up for the people who want to enjoy lifting weights, you&#39;re the one taking it out on them with the whole &quot;I am strong and you are weak!&quot; thing. </p>

<p>The post is clearly designed to have a little laugh at and shit on those starting out in the various lifting hobbies that so many on here seem to enjoy.</p>

<p>If that&#39;s how you like to spend your time, that&#39;s fair enough.  Seems very unnecessary and needlessly antagonistic to me.   </p>

<p>I&#39;m going to have to disagree with your claim you&#39;re not fat as well, I&#39;ve just had a look at your picture and you&#39;re definitely on the chubby side and could do with shifting some fat off your admittedly very impressive gigantic frame.</p>

<p>This post is made to change and improve the mindset of the users here who want to be better and respond well too this form of motivation. You however are free to project whatever intention you want on to it. </p>

<p>This is at the end of my last bulk. This is as fat as I get. You are free to qualify this as fat, I would be very hypocritical to say you can&#39;t define subjective terms as you see fit but I want to make the record clear for anyone playing at home.</p>

<p>Erm, you made an entire thread in another forum laughing about how you were mocking the weak lifting noobs on here.</p>

<p>How about this, is this still fat?</p>

<p>I&#39;ll mock the people that are completely missing the point and are looking to be offended, sure. But it has nothing to so with what they can or can&#39;t lift. It has to do with a lack of critical thought, absent reading comprehension and excessive victim complex.</p>
