<div class="md"><p>You can find a lot of tips online for muscle building foods. Its kind of a meme, but true &quot;you have to eat big to get big&quot;.</p>

<p>Also peanut butter and honey sandwiches with a glass of milk is a lot more calories than you probably realize.</p>

<div class="md"><p>Bruh literally I&#39;m 5&#39;4 and only 40 kgs, literally almost no fat and only reason I&#39;m even 40 is cus of my muscles, and trust me if you want to maintain this shit and get more then you must at least have 2x times the protein of your body weight then convert to grams, for eg, my weight= 40, protein I should take = 40*2, 80kg now just remove the k, 80g.</p>

<div class="md"><p>This is my problem - I can get definition but no gains. I just can&#39;t bring myself to spend $100/month on powders so I can gain a bit more muscle mass than I know I&#39;ll lose the moment I start working out less.</p>

<div class="md"><p>I mean realistically you only have to spend like $30-$40 every 2 months or so. A jar of whey protein isnt that expensive and the big ones last awhile. It still has done fuck all for gaining weight but its a good way to get some nutrition without eating.</p>

<div class="md"><p>It can depend. I usually intake around 3000 calories in a regulwr work day and am underweight. When I had the freetime and parents to pay for protein and such, I would drink a protein/ mass gain shake alongside every meal.</p>

<p>In 3 or 4 years of high school I gained about 20 lbs of muscle while doing the protein shakes and lifting weights once for a class, once after school, and then doing sports practice.</p>

<p>As soon as I graduated I started losing it immediately and am now back to underweight.</p>

<div class="md"><p>That&#39;s the issue. Gaining weight is hard enough but if you&#39;re skinny and you just stop with meals for weight gainsfor 2 weeks all your work of the last months is gone. Losing weight can be very easy for some people</p>

<div class="md"><p>It is a lot easier to maintain muscle than people think. 1-2 full body workouts and just maintenance calories will keep your muscles.   </p>

<p>Side note, there is a real thing called muscle memory, where if you stop lifting for a long time and lose muscle mass, it is much easier to gain it back.</p>

<div class="md"><p>I hear people talk about how they LOVE food and just CAN&#39;T stop eating.</p>

<p>That feeling is much less of a thing if there isnt a risk-reward factor. Eating is work for me many times. Sometimes I feel full but HAVE to try and eat more because if I don&#39;t, I will waste away even more.</p>

<p>Now that &quot;dad bods&quot; are becoming more mainstream popular, it sucks even more. I now  feel definitively less attractive than not just muscular guys, but also guys with an average build. Like our body type is only one tier above Obese/overweight but without the societal support structure that has been coopted from the body positivity movement for overweight people. Not that its a bad thing that the support stucture exists for them, but skinny people don&#39;t get generally get the same sympathy for their body struggles.</p>

<p>I know that societal norms go through periods of correction, but at this period it feels like being stubbornly thin is one of the less recognized and supported sources of body dysmopohia.</p>

<div class="md"><p>You’d think that’d help. I have a ridiculously fast metabolism and I’d have to eat an uncomfortably large amount of food to get the amount of protein needed for gaining muscle mass. If I work out without overeating till I’m sick i plateau around 145-150 and it’s pain in the ass honestly.</p>
