<div class="md"><p>I hate admitting this but before my partner started working out seriously he was very bony and it was always just slightly uncomfortable to rest my head on his shoulder or chest. Really made a huge difference in comfort when he bulked up with a bit of muscle. I never said anything to him either way though - we both tend to the scrawny side so I know how shitty remarks like that can make you feel.</p>

<div class="md"><p>I’m very skinny but I do push ups every other day. The nice thing about it is that we tone up pretty quickly, you’ll probably notice a change in a couple weeks. It’s gratifying and serves as its own motivation.</p>

<div class="md"><p>I can&#39;t manage to do a single push up lol, I&#39;m 5&#39;10 weighing 48kgs.
I&#39;ve tried building it up from easy to hard but no such luck, I&#39;ve just started doing deadlifts</p>

<div class="md"><p>You would benefit from getting into a consistent caloric surplus so you can build some muscle.</p>

<div class="md"><p>What the other guy said, eat more than usual. When it comes to us thin people you need to eat more, it doesn&#39;t really matter where it came from just that you have a caloric surplus.</p>

<div class="md"><p>I was like you brother. 5&#39;10 and 55kg. Now I am at 75 in 2yrs. Workout + Peanut butter/Milk. Trust me bro. You will get there. But you gotta workout. Your appetite might be less and you may actually lose some weight in the beginning (happened with me) but once you build a habit, you will start eating more.</p>

<div class="md"><p>Deadlifts won’t really make you bigger in the way that you might want (they’re good for strength gains tho)</p>

<p>Start doing some dumbbell chest presses, maybe close grip benchpress too once you feel comfortable. Pairing this with eating well (lots of protein) you will put on mass and be able to do quite a few pushups</p>

<div class="md"><p>I&#39;d add some sort of dedicated tricep workout to this like a tricep pushdown if you&#39;ve got access to a machine.  When you first push yourself up off the ground it&#39;s basically your triceps that are doing all the work so the stronger they are the easier lifting yourself up becomes</p>

<div class="md"><p>Not trying to sound like a jerk but i don&#39;t think 48kg is healthy for you. I think your life quality will seriously improve if you gain some weight. I used be 64 kgs and i am 6&#39;2. After i gained weight and reached 85kgs it really boosted my confidence.</p>

<div class="md"><p>Starting with a standard push-up is no easy feat. I recommend doing it against a wall and going from there: <a href="http://www.startbodyweight.com/p/push-up-progression.html?m=1">http://www.startbodyweight.com/p/push-up-progression.html?m=1</a></p>

<div class="md"><p>I’m a small dude 5’5” and went from 110 to 135 in just 5 months and it’s pretty much muscle since I can’t gain weight for the life of me. It’s really blew my mind how much those results start showing for us skinny folk.</p>
