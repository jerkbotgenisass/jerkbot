<div class="md"><p>Being forced by your family to keep eating and being blamed because you have a fast metabolism, they see you as unhealthy and defying them, when in reality. You simply do not feel hungry or you are full and can’t eat..</p>

<p>This was a big issue in my culture. Also, I was on Amphetamine (Vyvanse 70mg) for a whole year and was a work aholic.</p>

<p>My family made me feel so bad, and more anxious and kept annoying me and calling me bad names because again thought I was “defiant” because I would eat like at 6pm sometimes or 8pm and it would make me feel so bad.</p>

<p>Then comes the worry, they think something is seriously wrong with you (I know my own body you pricks, I wouldn’t legit starve myself smh)</p>

<p>So yeah I had to endure a whole year of damnation</p>

<p>Also even off the Vyvanse, I run and do a lot of cardio. Any weight we put on gets metabolized and burned so fast!</p>

<p>You lose weight extremely quickly even just by standing smh.</p>

<p>Hope that helped you understand</p>
