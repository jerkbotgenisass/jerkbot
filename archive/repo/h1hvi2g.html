<div class="md"><p>Back in the gym for the first time in 15 months this week after a back injury (wrestling hogs on my farm).  I had rehabbed properly in the hospital, then eased into it in my home gym.  It was time to get back out and see the boys again, though.  Felt good and actually did see some old regulars to my surprise.  Everyone said I looked good, but I know I was sucking in the gut.  Next stop is getting back on that dating scene.</p>
