<div class="md"><p>Ectomorph here. I can&#39;t put on muscle. I&#39;m the smallest guy at my gym. </p>

<p>&quot;Eat more and you&#39;ll get bigger&quot; they said, so I ate till I was about to throw up.</p>

<p>&quot;Work out harder and you&#39;ll get bigger&quot; they said. I work out harder and longer than anyone, and all it gets me is exhausted.</p>

<p>Did I get bigger? No  </p>

<p>When I stop working out and exercising, I start shrinking and losing weight.</p>

<p>&quot;Oh, you&#39;re so lucky! I wish I was skinny like you!&quot; they say (it doesn&#39;t help that I&#39;m a guy, and women say this to me). No, I don&#39;t want to be skinny. I want to be an average build. When I work out, I want to get bigger and stronger. I don&#39;t want to work out, just to maintain what little I have.</p>

<div class="md"><p>Ectomorph isn&#39;t a thing. You need to actually try trying if you want to build muscle.</p>
