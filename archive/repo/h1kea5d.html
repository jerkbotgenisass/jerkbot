<div class="md"><p>When my best friend had open heart surgery he was essentially given steroids after to strengthen his muscles etc. So at least be honest about what they are giving you.</p>

<p>In fact, if you just Google it its a very common practice and there are millions of articles on it. So stop misleading people like you are some superman hero that puts on magic numbers of muscle in a year</p>
