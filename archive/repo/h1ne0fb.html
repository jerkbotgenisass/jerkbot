<div class="md"><p>Instead of buying a fiber supplement, why don’t you just cut added sugars and eat more fibrous carbs, like brown rice, quinoa, oats, etc?</p>

<div class="md"><p>While that is good advice, even on a heavy cut I&#39;d rather eat things that some might consider junk food. None of those foods you mentioned are foods I even ever tried in my life actually lol</p>

<p>Apparently the boiled potatoes I eat have some fiber but it&#39;s not enough</p>

<div class="md"><p>So, you have pre-diabetic blood work, and instead of actually making a change, you want a quick band-aid fix? Well, there’s your problem. Nothing I can do to help with that mentality.</p>

<div class="md"><p>You sound like the individual who would try to eat 50lbs of meat in one sitting to get their creatine needs from food. Use your brain before you type.</p>

<p>I am on a diet, lost a few kilo&#39;s. Decided to eat out today. My daily food intake is simple meals etc, with not a lot of greens. I never grew up with them and I can&#39;t stomach most of them. Yes, like a child.</p>

<div class="md"><p>Yes, of course, I’m the problem for giving you an honest answer and not the confirmation bias you want to hear. How silly of me. </p>

<p>Fiber from foods &gt; fiber supplement &gt; no fiber. Good on you for losing a few kilos. A few minutes on google could teach how to make vegetables that taste good; probably better you eat them and get over that aversion now. If there’s anything else you’d like help with, feel free to respond like an adult, and then we can have an adult conversation about it.</p>

<div class="md"><p>Our topic was specifically fiber, if fiber could help.</p>

<p>Your claim now is fiber from foods are superior to supplemental fiber suddenly?</p>
