Is it true that training for extreme strength can be detrimental to long term joint stability?

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I’ve always shunned conventional gym training regimes for something that focuses on developing tendon, ligament strength in addition to muscles—I’ve never been able to progress beyond tucked planches, tucked front levers or 3-4 second flags. So I have enormous respect for the people who can perform them with ease, the discipline required to get all the way there is insane.</p>

<p>But I’ve always wondered if conditioning your body to withstand such unnaturally extreme forces at the joints could result in long term instability/damage; especially if a minimum level of regular training isn’t followed for the rest of the athlete’s life.</p>

<p>Does anyone know anything about this?</p>

<div class="md"><p>Probably. I started training relatively later in life, in my late 20s, after being underweight, fragile, and malnourished all my life until then and finally deciding to do something about it. I made good progress in the beginning and savored my early noob gains, thinking it&#39;d be no time before I got to the levers, freestanding handstand, planche, and maybe even the iron cross one day...</p>

<p>After finding myself stalling in my early 30s and, after some research and through the feedback of others, realizing I had bad--&gt;poor form on most of my exercises, on top of a whole host of movement mechanical dysfunctions (frozen shoulders, winging scapulae, tight hips, collapsed arches in feet, etc etc.) that impeded progress, I had to go back to the drawing board...</p>

<p>I severely underestimated the diifculty of a simple proper pushup, or how technical a properly executed pullup is if the goal is to activate the back muscles (especially the lats), or how a simple squat can be so hard to perfect if years and years of bad lifestyle habits (too much sitting, no physical activity, bad footwear) are ingrained into your habitual way of moving. </p>

<p>I&#39;m in my late 30s now and while things like a strict muscle-up and front lever sound awesome in theory, I&#39;m also definitely beginning to feel the aging process, for which the symptoms for me are increased joint achy-ness, lower energy levels, higher propensity for mild but niggling injuries, varying mood levels, and so on and so forth. I&#39;m content with just fine tuning and polishing the basics (pushups, pulllups, squats, some basic dumbbell exercises) while keeping up with my hobbies of basketball, soccer, swimming, and bicycling. I may never hit those advanced moves, but I sure as hell enjoy the journey to get there.</p>

<p>The great Steve Maxwell (one of my fitness heroes) is known to say that you don&#39;t find too many athletes over the age of 50 doing high-skill technical levers and holds, and that&#39;s because the joints will no longer tolerate that kind of pounding past a certain age. Now I think that that may be a little too pessimistic, but it&#39;s definitely food for thought.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t mean to say this in order to negate your desire to get to those fancy moves, rather as I said before to just enjoy the journey and train for joint longevity and overall fitness if you want to be in the game for the long haul. Take care and chase those dreams!</p>

<div class="md"><p>Thanks for sharing your journey! you’re definitely not alone when it comes to being eager to find progress — I believed I was flying along on way journey to a front lever when I could belt out waist pull ups, only to later become painfully aware that I had being learning pull ups wrong all along and would have to start from scratch. For over 6 months I had to consciously keep myself away from the pull up bar after that to avoid ruining my shoulders, while I started doing basic lat pull downs with the right form and posture.</p>

<p>With push ups/dips too, it’s crazy the number of people I see in gyms who are doing it wrong and are setting themselves up for long term rotator cuff issues. It takes a lot of discipline and self-awareness to train in a manner that’s right for your body, and not your ego lol; something I realized late haha.</p>

<p>And I agree; staying fit enough to manage 10 pull ups and push ups well into my 50s would be fantastic—I’d happily take that!</p>

<div class="md"><p>Well, I&#39;m 57, a newbie (about 2 1/2 months of bodyweight exercises) and I can now do 2 consecutive pullups and 3x8 push-ups. So it can be done and I look forward to progressing to more!</p>

<p>How exactly do you do a pull-up wrong? You&#39;re either lifting your body up to the bar or not, no?</p>
