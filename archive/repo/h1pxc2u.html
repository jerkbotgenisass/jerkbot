<div class="md"><p>Work on your mind-muscle connection. Check out some youtube vids on back exercises. Specifically, watch exactly WHERE on your back ( muscle specific, ex: if working lats, focusing on more upper/middle/lower lat) and HOW they pull it (on the pull [contraction] are they finishing the pull with their hand  either high/medium/low). People heavily underestimate mind muscle connection, as it is one of the most important aspects of bodybuilding. 
-Short&amp;Sweet- place the handle / bar / db, whatever, in the lower half of your palm, and pull through your elbow into your back, in comparison to through your fingers through your bicep.</p>

<div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t get it... how do you do an isolation exercise if you&#39;re not getting any MMC? Like how do you know you&#39;re doing anything right if you&#39;re not intentionally using the right muscles and feel it working? Isn&#39;t that really all that MMC is lmao?</p>

<div class="md"><p>MMC is kinda like a spectrum, where some exercises are really easy to &#39;feel&#39; working, like a bicep curl or a tricep pressdown.</p>

<p>On the other hand a lot of people struggle to &#39;feel&#39; their back muscles working (particularly the lats). Obviously it&#39;s debated whether this matters at all, but in my experience being able to &#39;feel&#39; the muscle working helps with getting a good pump, which translates to a much more positive workout, leading to more gains in the long run. </p>

<p>It may all be psychological, but that doesn&#39;t mean you neglect it, when I can feel a muscle working, it makes me <strong>love</strong> performing that movement, and like I said, leads to a better workout.</p>

<p>Eighteen male volunteers took part in the study. They all had at least one year of training experience, with a mean of eight years, and an average bench press of 103Â±25kg (227Â±55lbs), which is pretty solid for this type of research.

<p>MMC and  instructions to look out for cues is in my opinion the same. The former is anatomy oriented (&quot;squeeze your ass!&quot;), which is more popular in BB circles and the latter is more movement oriented (&quot;hip extension!&quot;) which is more popular in strength sport circles. You wouldn&#39;t question the effectiveness of technical cues, would you?</p>

<div class="md"><p>Google it man.. Anyone that is big / successful in bodybuilding, absolutely preaches it. Best proof is try it for yourself. Example: BB incline press for 8-10 reps. The entire set- lowering the weight down ( eccentric ) focusing on your upper chest controlling the weight a 3 count. Before the par taps your chest, explode upward ( concentric ) driving the weight up, through your upper chest. Immediately finish the set, pick up a 25lb plate, get back on the incline. Pinch press the plate, same 3 count down, using your pecs to control the weight downward. Explode upward, focusing on nothing but your upper-inner chest pushing the weight, and squeezing the upper-inner chest with everything you have. Hold the top contraction for a 3 count, continuing the squeeze. Itâ€™s mental man, it is real. Like anything else in life, if you arenâ€™t 100% focused on what you are doing at that moment, you arenâ€™t going to get the best result, in comparison to if you were 100% focused</p>
