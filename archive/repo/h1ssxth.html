<div class="md"><p>Bruh he’s literally back spotting correctly he can move his hands right under my chest and help me up if need be from my torso collapsing. Have you seen a powerlifting meet he’s doing it right</p>

<div class="md"><p>Power lifting meets also have spotters at each end of the bar. A single spotter like you are using is more liability than potential help.  Ever seen a squatter bail on the bar with a spotter hugging his chest?  Not a good situation.  That&#39;s just my 2 cents. You do you.</p>

<div class="md"><p>They are also doing maximal attempts and want the most safety possible - but I didn’t have three people to spot my 75% I just needed one on the last set just to be safe. And using your logic why have spotters at all just let the straps of the mono catch the weight fuck a spotter</p>

<p>You’ll have to explain how back spotting isn’t safe or is a liability - and I don’t bail on the bar when I have metal plates and a guy behind me because I’m not an asshole. It is your 2 cents it’s just not a good 2 cents</p>

<div class="md"><p>You think bailing on a heavy lift is always a choice?  Haven&#39;t been doing this long huh?  You have no idea when or how a lift may go wrong.  I plan for the worst, from the first set to the last, regardless of the weight.  You are putting your spotter at risk because you think that you know whats going to happen.</p>

<div class="md"><p>Nah man just almost 6-8 years of training depending on how you count it. I do know if I’m going to dump the bar on my back and I do what’s going to happen during 99% of my lifts because it’s a controlled environment with submaximal training not a field sport or max attempt. </p>

<p>I don’t plan for the worst because I’m not going to hyperfixate on shit that can’t go wrong in rare circumstances because the better thought process is making sure I’m doing everything right.</p>
