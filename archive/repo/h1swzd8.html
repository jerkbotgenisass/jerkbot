<div class="md"><p>If I&#39;m trying to get &quot;leaner&quot; is drinking water a bad thing?</p>

<p>I keep hearing water is great for you, but isn&#39;t water weight a thing? I&#39;ve noticed when I&#39;m drinking excessive amounts of water daily, I tend to look more bloated and definitely gain a pound or two.</p>

<p>Don&#39;t boxers purposely drain weight in order to look more, &quot;fit&quot;? I&#39;m confused with how beneficial water is.</p>
