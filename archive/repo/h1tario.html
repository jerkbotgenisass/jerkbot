<div class="md"><p>There&#39;s a genetic component to everything, so that&#39;s too broad to be meaningful.  The bigger issue with &#39;bad backs&#39; is from people who have been sedentary their entire life and are effectively allowing themselves to decompose while they&#39;re still breathing.  Then they&#39;ll attempt to do something outside of their ability and actually hurt themselves or simply be in pain because they spend all day in poor positions getting weaker.</p>

<p>Lower back pain is the seat of a lot of psychosomatic pain.  That&#39;s not to say it isn&#39;t real pain.  The thing with pain is that if you feel it, then it&#39;s real.  But, there isn&#39;t going to be any particular physical problem to point to or correct.  </p>

<p>Inb4 I have to hear about every redditor&#39;s high school &#39;injury&#39; that didn&#39;t actually happen or they never put any effort into strengthening over the following decades.  Get stronger and your back will hurt less.</p>

<div class="md"><p>Wrong regarding sedentary. I worked out my entire life and picked up a heavy trash can that caused a problem. Spondylitis to slip. Then, I really f’ed up my back when a horse threw me. Not sedentary! With respect, that was a judgey dumb comment. Back problems are from injuries. Maybe a small percentage are from lazy out of shape people, but most are from accident. Hence...some doctor specialize in athletes.</p>

<div class="md"><p>Traumatic injuries are not the norm. And, strong people don&#39;t get hurt taking out the trash.</p>

<div class="md"><p>Yeah this guy’s pain is psychosomatic like you said. That’s how it was for me. Excruciating pain during all sorts of random physical activity until I learned it was mental stress related. I figured out what needed attention whenever the pain would flare up. People usually won’t accept this until they’ve gone through enough doctors and the pain gets bad enough</p>

<div class="md"><p>It&#39;s one of those things that people get a lot of stubborn pride tied up in.  In their effort to keep pushing on and muddling forward they end up shutting out a lot of things that would help them.</p>

<p>Good on you for being brave enough to figure things out.  Most people don&#39;t.</p>

<div class="md"><p>I didn’t bend my knees to lift a heavy trash can to put in my trunk. I was susceptible as all spondylitis is and lifting it incorrectly caused a fracture in my back. But you sound like you know everything you must be in sports medicine. I bet you don’t think professional athletes have cardiac arrest on a soccer field either huh? Ridiculous.
Something I have learned especially after a spinal cord injury that fortunately left me able to walk, but numb with horrible nerve pain. It’s really easy to think you know other’s pain and how and why they have it. But once you know pain, when you hear another claim they have pain you stop doing that sort of thing. You listen and believe. You don’t imagine you are above it. That empathy goes far. I’ve heard so many people describe pain and when they open up, there is embarrassment and fear others think they fake it or are fragile. I have a friend who needed surgery and her doctor who was the best surgeon was a real jerk. That is...until he was hit by a car on his bike and became a paraplegic with horrible nerve pain. Afterward he apologized saying he had no idea how horrible things could be. Lifting something incorrectly can damage your back no matter how in shape you are. And the strongest person alive can get injured.</p>
