<div class="md"><p>Think about the person who&#39;s been grinding everyday at the gym. Going hard in the kitchen. Wondering why they haven&#39;t achieved anything like this.</p>

<p>People should know that this is the result of extra enhancements and not to compare their natural grind to this.</p>

<div class="md"><p>Theres no denying he looks great, and I&#39;ve got no problem with people taking gear as long as they admit it. Hes clearly taken gear. I&#39;ve trained for 15nyears and you cant make the transformation at that speed without gear. Hes obviously smashed his diet too and I&#39;m not saying its all down to gear coz hes clearly worked hard. But that&#39;s 100% gear</p>

<div class="md"><p>It&#39;s interesting that you say that. Because I have a friend who looks like that but he&#39;s never taken any ped&#39;s and doesn&#39;t really follow a strict diet. He doesn&#39;t even work out that much. He&#39;s a delivery driver for FedEx Ground though, so I guess he gets his exercise in that way ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è</p>

<div class="md"><p>That‚Äôs the kinda comment that makes it clear you‚Äôre lying. No one with this sort of mass has spent even two hours being ‚Äúhungry.‚Äù Because in order to obtain and maintain this sort of mass while doing ‚Äú6 sessions a week‚Äù is to literally constantly eat very high calories from carbs and protein. And you can‚Äôt feel hunger when you‚Äôre constantly eating dense foods. That‚Äôs just now how biology works.</p>

<div class="md"><p>Fair play if that&#39;s what you have done. But I&#39;ve been around gyms for 15 years. The level of vascularity you&#39;ve achieved in 18 months is almost unheard of. What body part had you trained prior to the photo being taken?</p>

<div class="md"><p>I&#39;ve been the gym 10s of thousands of times. I&#39;ve had pump after pump. But none that give me bicep pumps like that after training fucking shoulders. People get annoyed because posts like this will dishearten people trying to start out getting in shape. I don&#39;t give a fuck, I&#39;ve trained 15 years and I&#39;m fine. But I feel for people starting out expecting this to happen after 18 months without gear</p>

<div class="md"><p>Not trying to argue because he worked hard either way so props regardless, but looking at OPs other posts I think this progress is a lil exaggerated by a juicy pump and flexing. His other post, while still super impressive, seems less indicative of gear. Just my two cents though</p>

<div class="md"><p>You&#39;ve gotta flex for photos though haha. I&#39;m just sort of enhancing the point made about people trying to grind it naturally, you should just admit you take gear so as not to muddy the water of other peoples thinking. I know loads of lads who take gear openly but they admit it</p>
