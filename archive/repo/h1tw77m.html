2 Strength days, 1 Day volume Per Week ?

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Morning,</p>

<p>I have been getting pretty good at volume work - lots of volume pushups pullups etc</p>

<p>I hit a point where numbers were becoming too large - (100 pullups every other day - 200-300 pushups every other day etc ..</p>

<p>I have moved onto weighted stuff to bring numbers back down to normal levels (4 sets x 8 reps ish)  </p>

<p>Do we think 2x strength days for Pull/Push /Core is enough to advance with strength and one day Volume per week will suffice for volume ?,</p>

<p>Do I focus 3x week on weighted and forget volume work for a couple of months ? .. </p>

<p>Goal is to get to 70% BW pullup but i wanted to keep some volume work,</p>

<p>Cheers BWF Gurus</p>

<p>Even less than that could work . Do 1-2 times a week strength and unless you want to breal a world record, I would ditch the volume work. It probably won&#39;t contribute thst much to strength but it will contribute to fatigue.</p>
