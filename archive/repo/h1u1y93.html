<div class="md"><p>Just a matter of fact, if you were not able to get into a transformatoin like this in a 1.5 years, just remember that the dude is on either Sarms/Steroids/PEDs.</p>

<p>So, don&#39;t be sad, just stay natural. Hope that OP took gear considering the heart congential diseases in mind, no hate , but, actually, I just hope that OP did think about it. If he did it just for looking good and not even considering the fact that death comes pretty early with PEDs, then he might be lacking information, and the correct Info sources.</p>

<p>Bottled down to me, I am a dude with super great genetics, I don&#39;t try hard to but I have been gifted to stay at a 15% of bodyfat, which is the best Percentage so far ( considering how much you can eat and still stay in shape ) . If I saw this without acknowledging that he was on PEDs, I would have got sad, but it aint the truth. I have educated myself to the point where I don&#39;t get influenced by people on PEDs, spreading their lies as to how they got jacked in 2 years 1 year 1.5 years. Make yourself like me ( don&#39;t be influenced by PEDs )</p>
