<div class="md"><p>Just a matter of fact, if you were not able to get into a transformatoin like this in a 1.5 years, just remember that the dude is on either Sarms/Steroids/PEDs.</p>

<p>So, don&#39;t be sad, just stay natural. Hope that OP took gear considering the heart congential diseases in mind, no hate , but, actually, I just hope that OP did think about it. If he did it just for looking good and not even considering the fact that death comes pretty early with PEDs, then he might be lacking information, and the correct Info sources.</p>

<p>Bottled down to me, I am a dude with super great genetics, I don&#39;t try hard to but I have been gifted to stay at a 15% of bodyfat, which is the best Percentage so far ( considering how much you can eat and still stay in shape ) . If I saw this without acknowledging that he was on PEDs, I would have got sad, but it aint the truth. I have educated myself to the point where I don&#39;t get influenced by people on PEDs, spreading their lies as to how they got jacked in 2 years 1 year 1.5 years. Make yourself like me ( don&#39;t be influenced by PEDs )</p>

<div class="md"><p>LMAOOOOOOOO You made my day fam My ig here salvy322 You can check my progression there. This really makes me smile and proud at he same time ‚ù§Ô∏è I have plenty of pics btw when I was obese af but I had good amount of muscle mass to begin my cut with. If u think I took gear that&#39;s fine I&#39;m not here to convince anyone. I trained hard showed to gym 6x per week every month for 1.5 years But ppl really dont see the hardwork they say whatever looks easy and Ik how overtraining looks like when you&#39;re about to throwup while doing Ryan Humiston workout.</p>

<div class="md"><p>Oh fuck off dude. If you‚Äôre lifting 6 sessions a week with enough volume to do this and you‚Äôre not on gear then you have a wholly blessed set of genetics that allow you to basically recover instantly. That‚Äôs how everyone knows you‚Äôre lying about being on gear‚Ä¶the amount of recovery time your body would‚Äôve needed to get from point A to point B would take a year and a half of just sleep, forget the time it takes to work out and live.</p>

<div class="md"><p>The fuck are you on about. 6 days a week is nothing special, if you program properly and have nutrition you have plenty of rest time. Everyone on this site seems to think everyone is on gear for literally any stupid reason ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è.</p>

<div class="md"><p>Pretty sure the human body needs time to recover last I checked. You can program for 6 days a week but if any of those days are heavy lifting days then your body needs time to heal itself. Going back into the gym the next day to lift a different body area is fine but eventually your whole body will just need rest. Unless you‚Äôre on gear. Then you can almost literally never stop lifting bc your body can heal itself so much faster or prevent or ignore fatigue so much better. That‚Äôs what the fuck I‚Äôm on about.</p>

<div class="md"><p>So you‚Äôre telling me it‚Äôs impossible for a natural to do a PPL split 6 days a week? You need to do more research my man. Deloads exist, so does proper volume programming, so does common sense.</p>

<div class="md"><p>I‚Äôve done a 6 day per week PPL for years as a natty with no problem</p>

<p>Take into account that the majority of the progress you‚Äôre seeing here is fat loss. Yeah some muscle was gained but he had a decent base at the start.</p>

<p>With regular lighting, no pump - looks natty to me.</p>

<p>No human being on this planet is used to that response that you are taking about.</p>

<p>I am not hating on you taking gear, I just want you to stop spreading the lies to people younger than you, so they dont die early kiddo.</p>

<div class="md"><p>tRUTH IS, We are more educated that an were ever before regarding PEDs.</p>

<p>So, the old fashioned Mike O&#39;Hearn game of playing as a Fake natty does not work, no, nor it is ever gonna work.</p>

<p>For the OP, I have no hate, but some anger, because he is misleading a young generation out there who believe that they can achieve that in 1.5 years while being natural.</p>

<p>I believe OP started natural but got sick of it after a month or so, after he realised the fact that what he sees on YouTube is not natty at all, and finally decided to go on gear.</p>

<p>LMAO dudes really be taking PEDs just to be a swole IT technician.</p>

<div class="md"><p>It‚Äôs so obvious when someone with an eye for fitness comes into money or something and instantly flips their physique and tries to claim natty. Like no dude. Maybe if you had god tier genetics and world class training from the first sign of puberty on your little pecker‚Ä¶then MAYBE someone might believe you‚Äôre natty. But to go from IT schlub to Adonis in a year and a half and claim you were ‚Äúhungry‚Äù the whole time AND in the gym for 6 full sessions a week‚Ä¶.that shit just isn‚Äôt how the body operates. Unless you use steroids or some sort of gear.</p>
