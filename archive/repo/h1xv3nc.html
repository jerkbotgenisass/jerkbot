<div class="md"><p>This guy probably took some SARMS or Pro hormones. Puberty, newbie gains and genetics surely helped alot but I doubt this is 100% natural. 35lbs of contractile tissue doesn’t just happen in 2 years. Maybe 35lbs of water, muscle and fat. This guy clearly stayed the same bf + 35lbs. I agree with the guy below, take it as a compliment; if you are natural, you have way better genetics than me that’s for sure.</p>

<div class="md"><p>Not gonna say this guy is on PEDS because I don’t know. But I will say my little cousin was talking to me about sarms being used in high school. He said 9/10 people who lift use it</p>

<div class="md"><p>The worst part is that they all think they are natural because its an oral not an injectable..</p>

<div class="md"><p>Lmao id say 90% of the kids at my highschool and college who had sarms bought them from some random website that wasn&#39;t legit that tiktok plugged to them. The nature of being oral makes everyone feel like &quot;oh yeah im just using it like creatine&quot; not realizing its the same if not worse for you than straight test.</p>

<div class="md"><p>You don’t need post-cycle therapy on most SARMs cycles, and you won’t develop gyno, so they have that going for them.</p>

<p>For example, LGD can suppress your test, but won’t shut it down. It will go back to normal even without a PCT, but you can speed up the process with PCT.</p>

<div class="md"><p>Holy shit, is everyone that has decent progress on gear???
This is not 35lbs of pure muscle, i’d say more like 25lbs and 10lbs of fat, which is possible naturally in even a shorter amount of time, and even if it was 35lbs of pure muscle (which is not) is totally possible (and even expected if you follow an actual program).</p>

<p>Also take in consideration that in one he is posing/flexing and in the other is a shitty random photo, why do people still don’t understand that…</p>
