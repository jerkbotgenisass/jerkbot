<div class="md"><p>Keep in mind I am noob into fitness but I would suggest eating healthy and well but  but doing an endomorphic routine of exercises. If you want to lose side fat while getting abs I humbly suggest that you do alot of alternate ab curl, and ab twists, if you want you can even add weight to it, altho remember that for your body type is better repetion than weight! But I also suggest that you give a lot of emphasis to your upper back and chest since it will help you  not to notice so much the side fat. Over all great job and remember to exercise all of your body! :)</p>
