<div class="md"><p>Hi, I really don’t want to knock your efforts or dedication. The whole lifting your butt thing is true, and it’s happened because the weight is too heavy for you. All the force being generated by the muscles involved in the bench press moves the elbow down and up, and the forearm parallel to the bar with elbow directly underneath the bar so that no moment force develops between the bar and the elbow. The action around the shoulder joint contributes to the movement of the elbow, but the shoulder doesn’t – or at least shouldn’t – change its position against the bench while the humerus is moving. On the eccentric movement, when you push off from the bottom position the elbows are tightened to the body and the bar shifts to a position over the stomach. This is super dangerous for your shoulders. It could cause a serious injury. I’m unsure of your intentions in training. If it’s just to keep beating your PR then I would make sure that you can always do a lighter weight with the complete technique and when you do try a step up that your spotter guides the bar to stop it shifting forward. Bench press by far is the most dangerous lift in my opinion. The book ‘starting strength’ is brilliant for staying safe. All the best with it.</p>
