	<title>LPT: Never compliment someone for losing weight unless you know it’s intentional. I once told a coworker he looked great after he lost a little weight. He looked sad afterwards. I didn’t understand why. I found out later he had terminal cancer. I never comment on anyone’s weight now.</title>

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Edit: I’m just saying don’t lead with “you look great!” Say “wow! Great to see you! What have you been up to?” People will usually respond with an answer that lets you know if they have changed their lifestyle. Then you can say “yeah! You look amazing” 
I’m a super nice person. Not a jerk for those of you saying I’m a robot or making mean comments or saying I should have known the difference. Wow.
This man had just lost maybe 7-10lbs. It was early on in his illness. He eventually get losing weight and passed away...
So I was giving this life tip so people aren’t haunted like I am. In that moment I reminded him he was dying and I hurt him.</p>

<div class="md"><p>Back in college I had noticed a fellow freshman in the dining hall who had been losing a lot of weight and was becoming frighteningly skinny. She always sat with the same friend group. Sometimes she got food and stirred it around her plate. Sometimes wouldn’t even get food but just sat with her friends. I was bewildered that her friends didn’t talk to her about her eating disorder. I didn’t really know her but finally mustered up the courage to say something, not rudely but out of concern. She had gotten up and was getting something to drink, so I took the opportunity to talk to her. As I approached her, one of her friends came up to her from the other side and quietly asked her how the chemo was going. I quickly got a drink and walked away. I thank God that I didn’t insert my whole leg in my mouth that day. Sorry I judged her. Sorry I judged her friends.</p>
