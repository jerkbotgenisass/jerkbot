<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I am 17F and my goal is to start my workout goal. I find myself being too skinny and feeling weak 24/7, and I really want to work on this so that I can be a happier and fitter version of myself for the future. </p>

<p>Recently, I’ve found a girl that has gone through three years of working out and eating properly who was the exact body type I am right now. However, she does not have her routine or what she eats posted. I’ve been trying to figure that out but I’m inexperienced in these types of things. The body she has now is the ideal body I want to achieve.</p>

<p>Currently I am 5’3 and 41 kg and I do not eat enough calories I should be consuming every day. I believe I should be eating 1600 calories (150 grams protein, under 100 carbs)? There are a few photos that’ll show you what I want to achieve. <a href="https://vm.tiktok.com/ZMdkoQ4Fp/">here </a> is an example. </p>

<p>Any advice will help! I eagerly want to get my fitness in a state better than what it is right now. I find it hard doing this myself because I feel like I would do so much better when I am given a routine and meal plan instead of making it myself with 0 knowledge.</p>

<div class="md"><p>It has nothing to do with being toxic. Athlean X is just not a Good Place to learn like anything.<br/>
Plus it’s not toxic calling out something inherently bad.</p>

<div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t know where you have formed this opinion but as someone that has viewed him and many others for information I didn&#39;t see anything inherently bad at all. Your opinion is obviously subjective and coming at the top person and saying he knows nothing on form because he recommended Jeff I see as toxic.</p>

<p>So you think exhaling before going down on squats is good advice? Or telling ppl to NOT retract their scapula for bench pressing?</p>

<p>Just to give two examples</p>
