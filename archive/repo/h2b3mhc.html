	<title>LPT: Never compliment someone for losing weight unless you know it’s intentional. I once told a coworker he looked great after he lost a little weight. He looked sad afterwards. I didn’t understand why. I found out later he had terminal cancer. I never comment on anyone’s weight now.</title>

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Edit: I’m just saying don’t lead with “you look great!” Say “wow! Great to see you! What have you been up to?” People will usually respond with an answer that lets you know if they have changed their lifestyle. Then you can say “yeah! You look amazing” 
I’m a super nice person. Not a jerk for those of you saying I’m a robot or making mean comments or saying I should have known the difference. Wow.
This man had just lost maybe 7-10lbs. It was early on in his illness. He eventually get losing weight and passed away...
So I was giving this life tip so people aren’t haunted like I am. In that moment I reminded him he was dying and I hurt him.</p>

<div class="md"><p>I lost 30kg in literal weeks, I was incredibly sick, and was struggling to function. Everyone told me how good I looked. Turns out I was having a serious blow-up of autoimmune thyroid disease, and was going into thyroid storm. I had been telling my doctor I wasn&#39;t right for 4 years at that point, but he put it down to studying full time and working part time plus having 2 small children. He congratulated me on the weight loss, even when I said it was unintentional. Six weeks later I collapsed at uni, and was taken to ED with a heart rate of 145. Guess something was actually wrong after all.</p>
