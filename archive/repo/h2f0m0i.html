<div class="md"><p>The notion that reps and sets will have a difference on strength or power or anything is a complete myth the only thing you should be concerned about is reaching failure safely so any 4-12 reps range is perfect due to not using unsafe amounts of weight especially in compound movements but also not doing to many reps to sacrifice form. The amount of sets will equate to how much time you wanna work a muscle group and how much time you have. The important thing is hit failure every set! But be safe and enjoy.</p>
