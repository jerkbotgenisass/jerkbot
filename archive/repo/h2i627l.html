<div class="md"><p>I&#39;ve never seen someone look as decently fit as he is struggle with 225 so badly. 225, is like the base weight that most people who lift regularly can do..</p>

<div class="md"><p>Don&#39;t. Ego lifting is wack. I am bigger/stronger/more cut than this guy... It&#39;s not about how much weight you do. The contraction of the muscle is the most important part. Sure I can bench 315+ but if I am really trying to work my muscle I can go all the way down to 135lbs and flex throughout the movement slow and undercontrol and I get a better workout than if I get that 315x6+reps.</p>

<p>You&#39;re not even getting stimulus at 135lbs if you&#39;re capable of 315x6, you&#39;re not getting a better workout by &quot;flexing throughout the movement&quot;.</p>
