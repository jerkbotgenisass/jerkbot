<div class="md"><p>Looking for new routine‚Ä¶I (F17) have been working out hard and consistently at my local gym for about 10 months. I‚Äôm a fan of both lifting weights and running; currently, I alternate days between the two, going to the gym for about 1.5 hours and running 5-7 miles. Is there a program out there, preferably a 6 day program, that incorporates both? I‚Äôm trying to build muscle right now, and just maintain my cardio endurance.</p>

<div class="md"><p>wdym? If you mean to imply that I‚Äôm wasting time I‚Äôm not lol, I never talk to anybody. I just do a lot of reps and a high volume of weight, which has been leaving me totally gassed after every workout. Rn Im just trying to find a new, more balanced plan.</p>

<div class="md"><p>Nah what I‚Äôm saying is, if you train ‚Äúeffectively‚Äù. You only need 50 minutes </p>

<p>Effectively meaning you make a 1-3% increase every session</p>

<div class="md"><p>This is overly simplistic. The larger your program becomes, or  the more volume you, add or the higher weights relative to your max you lift - the longer the workout will take.</p>

<p>Stay there until you are done, and then go home. The clock doesnt know how much work you need to do.</p>

<div class="md"><p>I do not think most people are in a constant sympathetic state when they are in the gym, or that their gym state can be meaningfully compared to a real-world example or that it reaches the levels where it would be detrimental to health. 
I do not think we evolved to a state where being active for more than 60 minutes at a time is bad for us. This would mean most long distance activities would be majorly detrimental to our health, and (ultra) maratons ought to be damn near lethal, no? </p>

<p>If you are hyped out of your mind every second you are training, you need to lay off the preworkout, find a better program, and learn to rest more between sets, imho.</p>

<div class="md"><p>So when i am done with a set and i am on my phone chilling taking a small break before my next set, then i am just as sympathetic as if i was doing exclusively giantsets with as little rest time as possible?</p>

<p>I dont believe this to be as detrimental as you imply. Some programs are just too big to get done in an hour. Especially if you are doing high volume or high intensity work then you need more time.</p>

<div class="md"><p>Yes you are still in a sympathetic state. </p>

<p>I‚Äôm not implying your gonna die.</p>

<p>I‚Äôm just saying that you can improve 2-3% every workout if you train effectively.</p>

<p>Training for longer than 50 minutes will inhibit this</p>

<div class="md"><p>Do you have any sources for this that i could read further? 3% per session is what, 10% greater results per week, if multiplicative, and 20% after two weeks?</p>

<p>How would a typical workout that allows this kind of insane progression look like?</p>
