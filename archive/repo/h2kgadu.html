<div class="md"><p>This is a pretty dumb question, but why don&#39;t we count water as a macro?</p>

<p>Like I get that it doesn&#39;t provide calories, but it&#39;s a major contributor to weight and you can change your water weight by controlling your activity and what you consume. </p>

<p>When looking up info on weight loss, there&#39;s lots of info about controlling fat and muscle but basically no focus on water weight. People act like it &quot;doesn&#39;t count.&quot;</p>
