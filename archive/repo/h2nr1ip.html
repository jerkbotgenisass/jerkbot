<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Hey everyone,</p>

<p>Just found this subreddit. I started keto last Sunday after fasting all weekend and have already lost a good bit of weight.</p>

<p>I&#39;m looking to lose fat and tone and then focus on gaining muscle.</p>

<p>I&#39;ve been going on long walks every day after work (I work from home), and 3-4x a week I do a heavy kettlebell workout (swinging 50-70 lbs).</p>

<p>I think I still need to eat more fats every day, but so far my energy levels have been okay.</p>

<p>Just wanted to get some feedback on this current regiment.</p>

<div class="md"><p>iv been on keto for 3 months.  I was always under the impression that loosing fat and building muscle at the same time was impossible.  However, iv been doing just that with keto.  5 x weight lifting workouts per week, walking the dog every day for an hour and eating a ton of protein + Fat.  i look leaner and have a good amount of muscle.  It should be noted though that i have consistently been lifting weights for about 7 years now.</p>
