<p>For both strength and hypertrophy, moving the weight as fast/explosively as you can with control helps recruit the most motor units, which is what you want.</p>

<div class="md"><p>No, it isn&#39;t. The heart has been studied and documented as an organ for literally hundreds of years.</p>

<p>What you&#39;ve presented is a claim, not a fact.</p>

<p>The link from the other guy responding to you actually indicates that the opposite of your claim is the case.</p>

<div class="md"><p>If you read it his link says this:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>With low (50% 1RM) loads on the bench press, trained participants were able to slightly increase pec and triceps activation by focusing on the target muscle, but only when performing slow reps</p>

<p>Bodybuilders and physique athletes swear they can feel a stronger contraction during an exercise in the target muscle when they actively focus on using that muscle: the “mind-muscle connection.” In fact, there’s considerable research to support that premise; internal cues (focusing on part of the body) consistently lead to increased muscle activation compared to no cues or external cues (focusing on the desired outcome of the movement).</p>
</blockquote>

<p>i.e. MMC is a real but inconsistent phenomenon</p>

<p>Alongside plenty of other papers saying the same thing. I know you only want to argue but you can do your own homework. As I said I don&#39;t really care for your opinion or denial of the literature.</p>

<div class="md"><p>You skipped over the part where it says:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Trying to press the weight explosively resulted in more muscle activation than pressing the weight slowly, regardless of cues.</p>

<p>I also haven&#39;t disavowed the concept of MMC; I only disavow your claim of it resulting in more muscle growth.</p>

<p>It&#39;s not my job to prove your claim for you.</p>

<p>As for denying the literature...What is there to deny when you haven&#39;t provided any?</p>
