<div class="md"><p>Lmao, as someone who‚Äôs field of study is psychology I assure you that phone addiction is absolutely comparable to hard drug addiction. We actually did a massive study on this about a month ago. </p>

<p>Just because it‚Äôs not physically addictive does not mean it‚Äôs not comparable to hard drugs. It was actually interesting in the sense that people who have their phones taken without their permission begin to show extreme signs of distress. Some heavy users can have psychological effects so bad that it can be even worse mentally than hard drugs.</p>

<p>Not only when taken away, but also when losing their phones. So although having something taken does play a role, through the experiment it was clear that like 90% of the distress was caused by not having the phone in general and not knowing where it was.</p>

<p>You&#39;re asking the entirely wrong question here. The appropriate question is not whether or not I could, its whether or not it would be easier for me to do so than it would be for a heroin addict to stop using heroin for a month. But even then, for them to be comparable you need to even out the incentive to quit/risk of continuing. The incentive I see from going to a flip phone is zero, the risks associated with continuing use are also near zero. The heroin addict is by continuing to use is risking overdose, premature death, disease from IV drug use, loss of job, home, etc. they have a massive incentive to quit. And yet cannot because the addiction is so powerful.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>You say they aren‚Äôt comparable because you most likely haven‚Äôt gone without your phone for an extended duration of time.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I say they aren&#39;t because they aren&#39;t and the fact that you have to resort to an incredibly disingenuous framing of the issue and huge false equivalencies to make your point illustrates it.</p>

<p>If I was risking a potentially deadly overdose every time I checked my phone, was nearly guaranteeing a massively shortened lifespan, and ruining my career and relationships then it would be pretty easy to switch to a flip phone. Hell, I&#39;d move to a landline.</p>

<p>Incentive to quit matters significantly when you&#39;re trying to measure the difficulty of quitting and strength of addiction. If there is zero, or a negative incentive to quit then why would someone feel compelled to quit in the first place? Would you consider my &#39;addiction&#39; to vegetables just as strong as an addiction to hard drugs because I won&#39;t quit vegetables for a month for no reason whatsoever?  ‚Äã</p>

<p>You can&#39;t just assume that refusal to quit something with near zero stakes associated and inability to quit something with massive stakes associated are comparable. </p>

<blockquote>

<p>Ah cool. So now you&#39;re moving the goalposts from a phone addiction to a social media addiction. </p>

<p>How many people are homeless because of their social media addiction? How many people are homeless because of their drug addiction? What is the rate of severe mental disorders among social media users? What is the rate of the same with hard drug addicts?  </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Your reply even further illustrates my point, you don‚Äôt want to try putting down the phone because you don‚Äôt feel there is an incentive to. Even though putting down any addiction should be incentive enough.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This is non-sensical. I didn&#39;t say I was addicted to my phone, but I was a heavy user. However, putting down an addiction does not need to be inherently self-incentivizing if the addiction does not have a consequential enough negative impact on your life. I&#39;m addicted to caffeine. Caffeine also makes me more productive and has no deleterious effects in the doses I take.</p>

<p>Lmao, as someone who‚Äôs field of study is psychology I assure you that phone addiction is absolutely comparable to hard drug addiction. We actually did a massive study on this about a month ago. </p>

<p>Just because it‚Äôs not physically addictive does not mean it‚Äôs not comparable to hard drugs. It was actually interesting in the sense that people who have their phones taken without their permission begin to show extreme signs of distress. Some heavy users can have psychological effects so bad that it can be even worse mentally than hard drugs.</p>

<p>This is the stupidest comment I&#39;ve read on here and probably ever will. For someone &quot;in the field of psychology&quot;, you should be ashamed and disappointed in yourself. People think these things are comparable because they both release dopamine but it&#39;s like comparing a drop of water to the ocean.</p>

<p>Long term substance abuse will change your dopamine/gaba/serotonin receptors forever. It will change them long term to the point of anhedonia.  They will need more and more over time to the point where it&#39;s never enough and nothing in life has color anymore. These are just some of the psychological parts of substance abuse. Of course it is also much worse for your body and can leave permanent brain and bodily impairments. Nerve damage, RLS, tinnitus, permanent debilitating issues.</p>

<p>I wonder why we have so many methadone clinics in the US and no flip phone clinics. I wonder why no one has ever died from phone withdrawal. All of the accidental ODs from recreational cell phone abuse, where are they? I&#39;m not interested in talking about this with you anymore, I&#39;d appreciate it if you stopped talking to me.</p>

<div class="md"><p>I never once said that phones are worse than hard drugs, I did say that their addiction is comparable.</p>

<p>Key word here, addiction! Never said anything about the long term effects of phone usage compared to hard drugs nor the chance of death. I just simply stated that phones can cause just as much psychological addiction as hard drugs. </p>

<p>You are taking the conversation away from my original point and branching out into topics I didn‚Äôt even mention because you are losing the argument. </p>

<p>Also daily extended screen time does alter the way your being functions in significant ways, there have been multiple studies on this. Causing depression, anxiety, OCD, insomnia. The quick serotonin and dopamine gained from social media also creates long term effects on the brains supply and production. </p>

<p>If you don‚Äôt want to discuss it then stop replying, but don‚Äôt bring up a whole other issue (such as death, bodily damage, etc) when the original point was about the psychological addiction.</p>

<p>You can literally go through withdrawals from cell phones.</p>

<div class="md"><p>If someone took my phone away I would panic since it costs several hundred dollars. Not as easily replaceable and I need it for my job</p>

<div class="md"><p>Ahh yes, interestingly enough though. It‚Äôs not only the phone aspect, you make a valid point which is an issue we had at first. Turns out even removing someone completely from just social media still causes massive amounts of stress and anxiety.</p>
