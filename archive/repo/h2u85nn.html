Does creatine build muscle mass?

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I know it may seem like a dumb question.. but I heard that creatine makes muscles look larger through water retention. For those who use it, did it make muscles larger? And how long until you see results? 
All while lifting weights of course</p>

<div class="md"><p>Indirectly, yes. Not even steroids &quot;build muscle&quot; alone. Basically allows you to have more energy stored and in turn, lift more throughout your workout. More volume = more gains.</p>

<div class="md"><p>Studies have shown that an equal amount of muscle is built on steroids without working out as without steroids while working out</p>

<div class="md"><p>Dude, nobody is saying you won&#39;t build muscle off steroids</p>

<p>The thing is these performance enhancing drugs make a huge difference compared to doing these things naturally and it&#39;s disingenuous and dangerous to imply they don&#39;t make a difference.</p>

<div class="md"><p>All I&#39;m saying is your statement is wrong, you can build muscle just with steroids and no excercise. It&#39;s dumb and nobody would do it, but it is possible</p>

<div class="md"><p>Steroids essentially allow your muscles to recover and repair much faster which leads to faster muscle gain. Without a stimulus (training) you wouldn&#39;t see a difference.</p>

<div class="md"><p>You realize that steroids or growth hormones are given to animals in order for them to grow more meat right? At 6 weeks old and without the space to move around a chicken is the same size as it would be at 6 months. So steroids alone will cause muscle increase, but obviously nowhere near what you would get combining it with exercise</p>
