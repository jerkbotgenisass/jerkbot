<div class="md"><p>I could do but chances are it would be overkill for you.</p>

<p>What are your goals?</p>

<div class="md"><p>So right now a beginner program like stronglifts 5Ã—5 or GSLP. With the patience and consistency to follow it to the letter for 6-12 months.</p>

<p>While eating 1g per lb of bodyweight of protein. </p>

<p>Drinking around 2 litres of water outside of a workout.</p>

<p>Getting 8 hours sleep every night.</p>

<p>These things will help you grow. Copying what others have built upto over time will just destroy you. </p>

<p>For example I am 31 years old and 84kg at 173cm. I&#39;ve dropped 10kg due to the British lockdown, so I am currently rebuilding my strength and muscle mass.</p>

<p>I do this concurrently with training for endurance like triathlons and with the pools being open again I can get better in the water again. As no doubt my skill has diminished considerably.</p>

<p>You couldn&#39;t do the same training as me, because you haven&#39;t built up the base of strength, muscle mass, conditioning and bodily awareness that I have over time. In addition my training has been adjusted to my personal strengths and weaknesses.</p>
