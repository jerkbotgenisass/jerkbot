<p>This is extremely similar to my current program, but he has actually slightly lower volume in both push and pull days. </p>

<p>I might be getting too much volume as it is. Whatâ€™re some of your thoughts about this program and the volume?</p>

<div class="md"><p>This is great for an advanced lifter like Jeff and I imagine it would work fine as long as you can recover from it and progress the weight you use for each movement over time.</p>

<p>to rant about the volume - volume (and everything else) imo is secondary to progressive tension overload. If you do 3 sets a week of bench, squat, deadlift, row, chins, ohp, etc (main compound lifts) and every week you add weight to the bar - that&#39;s better than 20 sets of each muscle or a program like this where you&#39;re not adding weight to the bar. In reality, it&#39;s hard to have one without the other, but it&#39;s important to realize this so you&#39;re not focusing on the wrong thing. IMO as a beginner, you should do less volume rather than more - focus on adding weight to the bar over time with standard good form. As you progress through your training career and become intermediate - one of the signs of which is that you will stall your lifts more frequently - this is the time to add volume, secondary exercises, advanced techniques like supersets/dropsets/rest pause/etc. Once your numbers are elite, you&#39;ll know what does and doesn&#39;t work for you by then and most likely you&#39;re not putting on much muscle at that point anyway if you&#39;re natural</p>
