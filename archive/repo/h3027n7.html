<div class="md"><p>It&#39;s fucking hilarious how people think taking gear will automatically make you a specimen. There&#39;s so many people on gear that don&#39;t even look like they lift it&#39;s funny.</p>

<div class="md"><p>Ive seen guys on gear eating McDonald&#39;s and who were ripped.</p>

<p>And a friend took gear and hardly trained and put on size.  </p>

<p>A pt friend has a gut one day and a week later he jumped back on his cycle and he was shredded.  </p>

<p>People can put on 20 kgs on a massive cycle.</p>

<div class="md"><p>You have 0 clue about what you‚Äôre talking about.</p>

<p>You can eat McDonald‚Äôs and be shredded natty.
‚ÄúPut on size‚Äù aka water and glycogen retention so you think he got big.
There is no drug on the planet that can take you from fat to shredded in one week. </p>

<p>Stop talking bullshit.</p>

<div class="md"><p>He was off his cycle then got back on it.  And if you do 20 mills s a week you can.   This is why id never do gear is how you lose at least 60 percent once you have to cycle off.   </p>

<p>Its funny seeing all the gear heads when they are off their cycles its like someone popped a balloon</p>
