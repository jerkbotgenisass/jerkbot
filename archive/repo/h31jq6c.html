<p>What kind of workouts would you need to start with if this was your end goal?</p>

<div class="md"><p>There are a lot of skills / strengths shown in the video. </p>

<p>He&#39;s doing a lot of hanging exercise, so pull ups to increase shoulder / back strength is a good start.</p>

<p>Ring exercises are pretty hard to get started with, so Ring dips would be a good start, if you are capable of them.  If not, you can just do extended arm ring hangs for as long as possible.  </p>

<p>For the flag type exercises, you can start with L sits on a bar (basically do a dead hang on a bar and lever your legs straight out in front and hold</p>

<p>The medicine ball stuff you could start practicing with a ball on the floor.  Do stuff like holding it between your ankles and lifting your legs, maybe try a throw if you&#39;re feeling froggy (just lifting a medicine ball with your angles is really difficult from the floor though).</p>

<p>Box jumps are a must to eventually get the explosiveness to do the jump he did, though unless you&#39;re a naturally gifted jumper, that&#39;s not a likely box jump for somebody to achieve.</p>

<div class="md"><p>Assuming you&#39;ve never worked out before, just start with cardio and add resistance training when you feel your muscles are ready for it.</p>

<p>To get to his level though, you&#39;d need to make it your life. I used to do a little body building back in the day but it was very expensive for supplements, equipment and specific diet. Plus, it takes a lot of time, working at it almost every day. I wasn&#39;t willing to make my entire lifestyle about that so I stopped trying to achieve those results. This guy pretty much lives at the gym.</p>

<div class="md"><p>Gaining muscle mass =/= bodybuilding</p>

<p>If you want to look like the guy in this video you need the right diet, the right routine, the right supplements, and a lot of spare time most people don&#39;t have in order to workout and meal prep. </p>

<p>Don&#39;t lie to people, saying you don&#39;t need that to achieve these results is disingenuous at best. It makes people think there&#39;s something wrong with them or their body because they can&#39;t achieve it naturally. You simply can&#39;t achieve those results without a lot of healthy living, which as most people know, is typically expensive.</p>

<div class="md"><p>Yeah exactly. This is top-tier fitness levels. Getting to here requires a lot of time and focus. It&#39;s got to be your main hobby, something you really love, or you won&#39;t get there. It&#39;s soo irresponsible to say it doesn&#39;t require an insane amount of time and a specific diet. It absolutely does and a fair amount of people will never be able to achieve this for various reasons.</p>

<div class="md"><p>And no, doesn’t have to be your literal life. Theresa way to achieve great fitness and conditioning without having a severe mis balance in your life. That is the misconception. It’s even a misconception within the industry of bodybuilding and physique competitors. A lot of unhealthy habits and body dismorphia issues. Its possible to integrate it into your life and have balance. I have done it myself, but then again it’s all relative to everyone on what they consider a lifestyle or just their life.</p>

<div class="md"><p>For sure, I don&#39;t do any bodybuilding but from what I gather running a proper test cycle is $$$ and very hard to do right. Plus, no matter how much shit u take it only gives you extra work capacity, so it&#39;s up to the athlete to push themselves harder to actually benefit from it</p>

<div class="md"><p>Actually, in a study men were administered either a placebo or test and divided into two groups, either working out or not.</p>

<p>Obviously the test + workout group saw the most muscle gain, but the test no work and placebo workout groups were pretty similar in terms of gain:</p>

<div class="md"><p>Progressive overload.  Start small and add volume or resistance very gradually.  It takes years to achieve fitness like this person has, and even then it is partly genetic.</p>

<p>The one thing I cannot emphasize enough is to go slow, and avoid injury.  Master your form with absurdly light feeling weight and get your tendons/ligaments used to the tension of resistance exercise.  This takes months to years, but injuries can set you back months and years, so go slow and appreciate the incremental improvements (better sleep, more energy, and noticable strength).</p>

<p>As far as specific exercises, bodyweight squats, pullups, Turkish get-ups, pushups, and hanging leg lifts/pikes are a great start with minimal equipment.  Functional, whole body exercises.  Add deadlifts and back squats over time and have a trainer teach you proper form (again to avoid injury).  </p>

<p>Otherwise, just be consistent and it&#39;s almost magical what you can achieve in time.</p>
