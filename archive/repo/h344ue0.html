<div class="md"><p>Doing close to 10 sets of high volume of any movement every day for 5 days (which is nsuns) IS dangerous for beginners. The reason i say this is because they have not fully learned to do particular movement especially squat and proper powerlifting bench press without resulting in injury. TLDR its not something I would like someone just learning proper form, doing 70 reps of progressive overloaded movements</p>

<div class="md"><p>Beginner loads are so light the chances of injury are low, higher volume allows for more reps to learn the movements. You are at most doing 2 tough AMRAP sets a workout on nsuns, all other sets should be relatively easy to that set</p>

<div class="md"><p>But you progress quickly on nsuns. You are about 2 months from the start from hitting around  around 8-9 rpe, at least for my training partner that i had with me. And 2 months is not enough time to teach all 3 movements to be done safely, while under rpe 9, and not hurt yourself. Just my opinion but nsuns should a transition from a easier and safer program like SS.</p>

<div class="md"><p>SS is the same if not worse, both are LP programs that are not meant to be run forever. If you stall on LP you shouldn&#39;t keep doing LP. Nsuns is fine to start with and lets you do more volume and different rep ranges and AMRAP sets. You shouldn&#39;t be sandbagging your progress because you&#39;re afraid of getting hurt</p>

<div class="md"><p>You progress once a week on nSuns. That&#39;s slower than beginner programs. 2 months is plenty of time to teach bench/squat/deadlift to a beginner. Starting Strength is garbage.</p>
