<div class="md"><p>Yes you definitely do. For optimal muscle growth, 1g of protein per lb of bodyweight. Carbs and fat are both important too. Personally I go with 40% protein and 30% for both carbs and fat.</p>

<p>Some may say to cut carbs out but they know nothing. Carbs are not evil. Carbs are your bodies main energy source. I&#39;m not saying to eat 400g of carbs everyday, but don&#39;t cut carbs out completely</p>

<div class="md"><p>You can do this at maintenance. I personally don&#39;t care for the whole cutting/bulking thing so I just eat at maintenance. I lose fat, but gain the weight back in muscle. I maintain 2100-2200 calories per day</p>

<div class="md"><p>Maintaining all the time is a great way to spin your wheels for years. This only works somewhat for people new to working out. Doing bulking and cutting cycles is way more effective if you want to see meaningful progress. I know tons of guys at my gym who look the same every year, just because they can&#39;t commit to a bulk.</p>

<p>Btw, I find your advice kind of ironic considering you made a progress post 13 days ago where you lost a shit load of weight. You obviously know the value of cutting.</p>

<div class="md"><p>It&#39;s called maingaining and is actually effective. Bulking is mostly fat gain not lean muscle. Everyone knows this. Yes you get some lean mass, but most is fat. Maingaining is gaining lean muscle and that&#39;s it. I&#39;m gonna go out on a limb here and say you think muscle can only be gained on a surplus when in fact muscle can still be gained in a deficit (not too much of a deficit of course). This has been proven.</p>

<p>There is nothing ironic about my progress and advice. I don&#39;t cut and bulk. I was 225lbs at 5&#39;6. And I lost 75lbs in 3 months which is very unhealthy and not safe. I lost shitloads of muscle too. I was eating 1200 calories while working a very physical job. I  went back up to 160lbs because I started eating properly. I have not lowered my calories since before Christmas and I was at a 34&quot; waist. Now I&#39;m at 32.8&quot;. So how could I have lost fat yet still gained muscle even when eating at maintenance.</p>
