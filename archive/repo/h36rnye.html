<div class="md"><p>Sure. CrossFit has problems but if you go to multiple boxes you&#39;ll find different programs and approaches. CrossFit at this point is less a strict brand/program and more just a general hodge podge. As an example my brother does CrossFit and iirc rarely does kipping pull-ups (and when he does do them it&#39;s for conditioning, not for strength), so clearly his box isn&#39;t the same as Reddits hypothetical &quot;WE ONLY KIP HERE!&quot; mess. It&#39;s like shitting on powerlifting because you can find PL gyms that are garbage. Just doing oly lifts, focussing on conditioning, doing WODs etc is fine. <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28085123/">The injury rate is low and the same as other recreational sports</a> so that side of things that gets fear mongered is silly.</p>

<p>At the very least CF aims to get people in shape. Rip tells people to bulk in every situation, don&#39;t do cardio, don&#39;t do conditioning, take 10 minutes between your FAHVES, tell anybody who diverges they&#39;re not doing the program, and turns them into fat slobs who only care about weight on the bar for a set of FAAAAHVE.</p>

<div class="md"><p>Alright let’s dissect this one by one.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Rip tells people to bulk in every situation</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The “situation“ being the SS program, which after reading the book you’ll see the reason why it’s justified. He doesn’t recommend GOMAD after the SS phase. So that’s myth debunked #1.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>don’t do cardio, don’t do conditioning</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Those two things are essentially the same. And yes, you are right, Rip doesn’t recommend cardio, and I agree with him, although it’s personal opinion. Weightlifting by itself provides enough aerobic exercise to promote weight loss if that’s your goal. It also prevents the body from losing its adaptation to resistance training and instead adapting to endurance, an undesirable result for a strength athlete.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>take 10 minutes between your fives</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I would like to see this quote, because I have never seen him say that. He does say, however, in his book that one should not emphasize the amount of rest between sets as much as people do. During PR or near PR sets long rests are pretty much expected for demanding exercises like the squat.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Tell anyone who diverges that they’re not doing the program</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Because they’re not. They’re doing <em>a</em> program, just not SS. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>turns them into fat slobs who only care about adding weight to the bar for their sets of five</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Because that’s what strength athletes do. They care about lifting more. Rip is a strength coach. I don’t know what you were expecting.</p>

<p>I never mentioned GOMAD. Rip recommends SS to everybody so if he&#39;s telling everyone to bulk on SS what I said tracks.</p>

<p>Firstly no, they are not. Secondly no, doing sets of FFFAAHVE with a 10 minute rest in-between is not aerobic exercise unless you&#39;re an out of shape slob. That&#39;s just silly. Your body doesn&#39;t lose adaptation to strength because you went for a run for fucks sake. Come on. Cardio is a great way to not die. Conditioning is a great way to not be out of shape. Hence why much more accomplished and much stronger coaches than Rip swear by them and program them in </p>

<p>I&#39;ve seen him tell people to take 10 minutes between sets of squats to eek out more LP repeatedly on his forum.</p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>Which is why it&#39;s not comparable to CrossFit. CrossFit isn&#39;t a strict program that forces you to do stupid shit like fall for the &quot;if you do more than one set of DLs your CNS will fry&quot; meme, 9 sets of bench a fortnight, no accessories etc </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Because that’s what strength athletes do. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>I&#39;ve yet to see any respected strength coach disregard all forms of progress aside from weight on the bar for one specific rep range. I also find it strange you would respond to &quot;he turns them into fat slobs&quot; with &quot;that&#39;s what strength athletes do&quot;.</p>

<div class="md"><p>We could go back and forth on a quote and respond match but I feel it’s too much effort since I’m probably not going to change your mind no matter how well presented and logical the information is. So I’ll just respond altogether in short.</p>

<p>SS is called <strong>Starting</strong> Strength for a reason, bro. If you are first starting out, you HAVE to bulk to get strong. Period! Doing these “clean bulks” of 200 caloric surplus is not going to illicit the same results as a man receiving more energy in his diet. Simple Thermodynamics.  If you’re scared of “getting fat”, you’re scared of achieving a stronger anabolic environment and are essentially leaving out potential gains during the noob phase. Once you get strong, what’s stopping you from cutting back on the diet and burn some fat? I ask with all honesty. </p>

<p>If you are only doing “a run”, then you are not incorporating cardio seriously within your program, are you? Also, who on earth wants to cut while trying to increase their LP? Your logic is flawed and makes ZERO sense. If you’re not training near PR, you will rest less. Next excuse. </p>

<p>SS is a strict program, but the PRINCIPLES of SS are not. In fact, if you read the book, <strong>you are not supposed to do the program after the beginner phase</strong>. I recommend you pick up and read his followup book: Practical Programming just to give you a clearer idea of what I mean.</p>

<p>Lastly, and once again, Rip is not a fat loss coach. He is a strength coach. He doesn’t care about you losing fat. He cares about you getting stronger. Anabolism = more of everything. More fat, more muscle. If you want to cut out the fat afterwards, that’s closer to Bodybuilding and outside of Rip’s scope. This is as simple as it gets bro. Don’t shit on SS just because it’s not this do-it-all program that magically makes you stronger and shredder at the same time. That’s not how it works.</p>

<p>P.S. if you are doing more than one set of Deadlifts AND Squatting + Pressing on the same day AND your CNS is not burnt out… you’re doing pussy weights. Facts, my man.</p>
