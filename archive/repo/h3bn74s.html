<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I&#39;m 5&#39;8&quot; and 195lbs, my current Squat/Deadlift/Bench PRs are 3 plates/4 plates/275lbs. I have 2 months of MMA training so far and have decided to split my training for more specialized focus. I have 5 hours a week of free time, on top of that I guess I have 4 hours/week that I dedicate to working out but I don&#39;t want to replace that with martial arts unless you guys think it&#39;d really help. </p>

<p>Also, is it okay if I eat mostly junk food if I also track and get enough protein, supplement multivitamin/fish oil/vitamin D, and have a huge salad everyday of nutrient-dense vegetables? I exercise very intensely and honestly dirty bulking has improved my strength and performance a lot for some reason. </p>

<div class="md"><p>Man if you are 5’8” and 195 you will need to drop at least 40 pounds. 195 in mma is guys typically over 6’. You need reach. </p>

<p>If mma is your goal divide your time between Thai and BJJ for a year or so. Then move into other things.</p>

<p>Also, lifting a lot of weight is almost meaningless in any of these sports and may actually hurt you in striking.</p>

<div class="md"><p>Where in what I said says that being stronger does not help? Powerlifting is terrible for boxing. If you are going to strength train it needs to be very specific to that sports.</p>

<p>striking power comes from fast twitch muscles. Putting on muscle mass will hurt this.</p>

<div class="md"><p>That muscle mass is not strength. A body builder has a tone of muscle mass, but not much functional strength. A runner has a tone of functional leg strength, but very little muscle mass.</p>
