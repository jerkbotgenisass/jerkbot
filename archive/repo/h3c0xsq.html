<div class="md"><p>Do I get the same metabolic benefit if I work a muscle group I rarely focus on? E.g; I Train legs and core often and get some epoc benefit.. if I train my back instead, even though it’s infrequent, will my body still consume calories the same as if I’d trained a muscle group I more regularly train?</p>

<div class="md"><p>Calorie expenditure is not driven by the familiarity your muscle has with work. It has to do with the heart rate you get to while training.</p>

<div class="md"><p>Uhm. So this statement is sort of contradictory.</p>

<p>HR Response has an inverse correlation with exercise/training modality familiarity.</p>

<p>An untrained runner will obviously have a larger hr response than a trained runner.</p>

<p>But part of that change as you become trained is an increase in efficiency of muscular coordination that leads to a decrease in hr and calories burned over time.</p>

<p>So yea hr can indirectly indicate calories burned, but we absolutely burn less calories doing activities our body is familiar with. It’s a huge part of why people who do the same cardio (time/distance/intensity) for long periods of time while consuming the same number of calories may eventually start to see weight gain - the calorie cost per unit of training has gone down. </p>

<p>It just totally misses the point because calories burned isn’t a meaningful metric for weight training progress.</p>

<div class="md"><p>Actually question for you, I&#39;m meant to be doing an hour&#39;s rucking tonight to burn some calories but my wife is doing a hatha yoga class. Should I just do that class instead and get more calories?</p>

<div class="md"><p>Again, genuinely can’t tell if this is meant to be a joke or a sarcastic reply but there’s more to calorie burn than heart rate and familiarity.</p>

<p>The point is given the exact same dose of external mechanical work familiarity with the task will generally burn fewer calories per unit of work. </p>

<p>That’s all.</p>

<div class="md"><p>Oh cool, so I jump rope and kettle bell swing every day and rarely play boules so obviously a game of boules burns more calories than the 500 kettle bell swings? Good to know!</p>

<div class="md"><p>Familiarity is only one of like a thousand variables that determines energy expenditure of an activity. </p>

<p>The point is more that a 180lb dude running 5 miles whos a trained runner will burn fewer calories than someone who sucks at running even if they also weigh 180lbs and move the same distance.</p>

<p>Mechanical and metabolic inefficiencies will increase the cost of the task. </p>

<p>People think it’s the same calories because it’s the same distance. Those people don’t actually understand basic biomechanics or human exercise physiology. </p>

<p>I’m not sure what if you were making a joke or trying to make a snappy comeback but either way I wasn’t trying to insult you. It’s just worth being precise when providing advice about a subject rife with misinformation.</p>

<p>Cheers.</p>

<div class="md"><p>Your arguing a point I never made to answer a question no one asked. But do go on.</p>

<p>Question do you believe that heart rate and calories burned are closely linked or not?</p>
