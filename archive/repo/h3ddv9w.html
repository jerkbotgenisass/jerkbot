<div class="md"><p>I should clarify. There are literally hundreds of people who compete in tested powerlifting who have pulled over 600lb.</p>

<div class="md"><p>Yet you doubt the likeliness that a fit, strong and healthy 50 year can deadlift 3Ã—600?</p>

<div class="md"><p>Still waiting on a reply there bud. You think because you moderate a shitty powerlifting sub you can dismiss scientific evidence and data because of your own anecdotal experience? None of your comments actually addressed anything I had implied and you went off on a tangent about pedantic bullshit.</p>

<p>I never implied men stop competing past age 50. My implications were that they would be weaker. I never said this guy is definitely on steroids, I implied that it was likely he was on something and my implications were based on this video alone. I don&#39;t know if he powerlifts or anything like that in his free time. It is more likely a man doing this weight at his age is on some form of testosterone than not. Balance of probabilities. </p>

<p>Do you want to compare powerlifting records seeing as you think I&#39;m full of shit? I don&#39;t powerlift anymore but I used to. I&#39;ll wait. Go back to circlejerking with normies on default subs you bored cunt.</p>

<div class="md"><p>JFC... insecure much? </p>

<p>I couldn&#39;t even see the other post you made until I checked your profile. It must have been shadowbanned for some reason.</p>

<div class="md"><p>Yeah I didn&#39;t get any notification about your next post either. You&#39;re still shadowbanned it seems and you also still have anger issues. How the hell am I projecting when you&#39;re the one having the emotional meltdown?</p>

<div class="md"><p>You replied to four of my comments in a row and accused me of lying about my powerlifting. If that&#39;s not indicative of your obsessive and emotional behaviour - </p>

<p>Your last 30 comments are literally just calling people out for being wrong (without educating them or providing any context) and consist of comments like</p>

<p>&#39;Please shut the fuck up. You&#39;re fucking wrong and you have no idea what you&#39;re talking about&#39;</p>

<p>The projection lies in you accusing me of having a breakdown when all you&#39;ve done for the last two days is whine incessantly and angrily over a random post. Make sense yet? </p>

<p>You prefer resorting to personal insults over contributing anything of substance to a discussion. </p>

<p>And you know what&#39;s really ironic? This comment right here:
&quot;Yeah, that some people like to spend more time complaining than they do making a positive impact on the sub.&quot;</p>

<p>Maybe you should take your own advice you vapid hypocrite.</p>

<div class="md"><p>It&#39;s weird when someone replies to multiple comments in a row isn&#39;t it? Don&#39;t know why you made up not getting notifications because I&#39;m not shadowbanned but I guess any excuse not to reply will do. At least you&#39;ve learned :)</p>
