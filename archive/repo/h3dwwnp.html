<div class="md"><p>You need to combine eating more with lifting weights. When you&#39;re skinny the change in your body after only 6 months of lifting is insane</p>

<div class="md"><p>Completely agree. I was super skinny into my stint in the Army, but once I deployed and started taking mass gainer in combination with my standard workouts, I bulked up very quickly over a 3-4 month period.</p>

<div class="md"><p>Man. I eat pretty ok but just keeping up with all the supplements... the amount of water I drink and the times I need to use the bathroom and waking up a few times every night to go just SUCKS</p>

<div class="md"><p>Keep in mind you don’t need to go directly to the diet and regiment of a competitive lifter. I was the skinniest of my friends and some of them started going hard at the gym, and with the best of intentions they dumped a pile of info on me and I wasn’t planning on spending 12 hours a week on it like they were. In retrospect, they were only telling me things that happened to work for them, and even things that they were still figuring out that didn’t end up working out.</p>

<p>Point being now I just take a scoop of whey in a glass of almond milk about an hour before my work out, and a scoop of creatine in a glass of cranberry juice 30 mins before my work out, Only taking creatine one month on one month off. That’s it that’s the whole regiment. I’ve packed on easily 30 lbs of muscle over the last 8 months and maybe 20 over two years before that just doing calisthenics without any supplements before that. I haven’t been to a gym in like 6 years, I do cardio and resistance and calisthenics at home and my only gear is 2 dumbbells with variable weight up to 65lbs each and a 200$ bench off Amazon (that was actually a shit purchase and I wish I’d gone for something closer to 300 or 400 but hey it works for now).</p>

<p>I gotta work out a lot but the regiment is pretty simple and I don’t get a fucked up stomach or sink a ton of money into it, and now that I’ve put on weight I have the bonus of not having to worry about going overweight or trimming fat because i have the insides of a scrawny person.</p>

<p>Im super glad I figured out that you don’t have to take it too 200% day one, I never in my life would have done what my buddies tried to sell me and probably never will. I could easily be getting like 15% more gains out of the time I spend, sure, but this is so much more manageable</p>

<p>Sent it back and got an iron master set</p>

<div class="md"><p>That’s the plan. I’ve been keeping an eye on all the joints until I can get something better. As it is I do dumbbell press on there so the weight is less than a bench press with a bar but still I dunnay like it</p>

<div class="md"><p>Yea the one I had also had like a 2-3 inch gap between the seat and back which made it unusable for even dumbbell presses</p>

<p>Wow those are some great results, what kind of workouts were you doing? Since you packed on 20 lbs of lean muscle mass before that you must be pretty advanced. What are your S/B/D numbers?
Got any pictures of your gains?</p>

<div class="md"><p>I should have explained better</p>

<p>^ I use a couple supplements that require quite a bit of water to drink it with so I feel I’m drinking more than usual just for them. When I don’t take them I don’t drink a lot and I don’t have to use the bathroom as much. </p>

<p>But for the sake of eh I need to get checked out for that. Have a few family members who have diabetes</p>
