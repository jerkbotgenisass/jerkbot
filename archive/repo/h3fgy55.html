<div class="md"><p>M 16 here. I’ve been bulking seriously for probably 7 months now and I’ve noticed huge changes in my body but I feel i’m putting on too much fat rather than muscle. I’m lifting 6x a week on a PPL split.  I’m still pretty skinny in clothes but once I take my shirt off you can see i’ve got a bit of fat. Should I keep bulking or cut for a while and then bulk again? My original goal was to bulk for like a year and a half.</p>

<div class="md"><p>Had to do some America conversions. You&#39;ve gained approximately 17 lbs during your bulk. You are going to gain some amount of fat for every pound of muscle that you gain. Let&#39;s say 1 lb of muscle for every lb of fat, it is likely more fat than that. I would recommend cutting for 8ish weeks. Burn off 5-10 lbs of that fat, then get back on with gaining weight. Definitely understand your concerns with being skinny for your height though. But you have to remember, this is a long process. Bulk cut cycles are typically a part of it.</p>

<div class="md"><p>Calories surplus probably isn&#39;t the driving issue here. My initial impression is that this is an insulin issue which is driving fat storage.</p>

<p>Shift the breakdown of your macros. Steer away from foods that will cause insulin spikes and push you into fat storage mode. Likely if you&#39;re bulking you&#39;re eating small meals with a large portion of carbs often. If this is the case you may have constantly elevated insulin levels throughout the day, preventing you from cutting body fat. Just make sure you are maintaining your calories with the other macros so you don&#39;t start undoing all the progress you&#39;ve made.</p>

<div class="md"><p>Why? Not saying that OP has an insulin issue. I&#39;m saying that when you&#39;re constantly eating with a heavy focus on using carbs to &quot;make up the difference&quot; between calories from protein and your calorie goal, like for example when you&#39;re &quot;seriously bulking&quot;, you never give your insulin levels a chance to recover. So your body chemistry is always acting against you. Simply by changing the breakdown of macros independent of calories you can stop this. I&#39;m basically saying he needs to clean up his bulk...</p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>He didn&#39;t say <em>anything</em> about carbs. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Simply by changing the breakdown of macros independent of calories you can stop this.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Literally no one can agree on what the &quot;best&quot; or &quot;healthiest&quot; macro split is. </p>

<p>Do you have some kind of specialized degree that&#39;s relevant to studying insulin or something? Are you an endocrinologist? Are you diabetic? </p>

<p>As far as we can tell this a healthy 16-year-old we&#39;re talking about. Getting him worried about his insulin sensitivity, hormones, or fixating on having the perfect macro split is so ridiculously useless and even counter-productive.</p>

<p>If <em>you</em> want to worry about those things for yourself, feel free. But please don&#39;t fear-monger this kind of stuff amongst others. Especially not kids, man.</p>

<div class="md"><p>Alright correction, &quot;the post meal, biochemical state in your body characterised by high blood insulin levels&quot;</p>

<p>Insulin being the hormone that is directly linked to storing glucose, fatty acids and glycerol in the adipose tissue of the body. Simultaneously to that, also the chemical that prevents the reverse process happening when we want to get rid of the fat.</p>

<p>As for jumping to conclusions, whenever fat is stored in the body insulin is involved... It&#39;s the hormone that induces the process so any discussion about fat storage must involve insulin, simple as that.</p>

<div class="md"><p>You can attack it multiple ways and it&#39;s purely down to individual needs. Bottom line up front I aim for 40:20:40 - Protein:Carbs:Fat</p>

<p>One way is to cut the number of meals / increase time between meals. Just eat bigger meals less often. This will allow your insulin levels to settle and you to return to normal as opposed to being constantly elevated. </p>

<p>The next way is to change the breakdown. The degree of this is dependent on the individual. Those who really struggle to keep fat off even on calorie deficit are likely insulin resistant, and would really benefit to limiting all carbs to no more than 5% of intake. More metabolically healthy people can see immense benefit from just replacing sugary foods with whole carb sources (eg. Difference between normal and wholemeal pasta)</p>

<div class="md"><p>My vote is do a mini cut, 4 to 6 weeks.</p>

<p>The advantage is you will lose a few pounds of fat, and can then get back to bulking quickly. Basically this let&#39;s you extend a bulk a bit longer without getting quite as fat.</p>

<div class="md"><p>You can gain some muscle, it’ll be slower than if you bulked.  You’re a kid so I wouldn’t be super worried about it.  Being healthy and having a healthy weight is a lot more important for you at this stage.</p>

<p>Possibly but definitely not recommended you try while you are growing.  Lifting doesn’t stunt growth but being in a caloric deficit and messing with your hormones absolutely can.  Just eat well and lift heavy things.  That will pay off the most in the long run.</p>
