<div class="md"><p>This is more diet related but hopefully is allowed. I have been stocking up on <a href="https://www.tesco.com/groceries/en-GB/products/251680648">these rice packets</a> which are pre-cooked and can be eaten hot or cold. At the moment I heat the entire packet then eat half and put the other half in the refrigerator for tomorrow. If I open the packet and eat half without heating, where/how should I store the uneaten half of the packet? Is it safe to put the packet into the fridge without reheating it first? I&#39;m never quite sure with rice.</p>
