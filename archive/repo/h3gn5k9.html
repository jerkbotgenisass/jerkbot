<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>You can drink it before meal.</p>

<p>You can have some during meal.</p>

<p>You can even have some after.</p>

<p>Your body is smart enough to regulate your stomach functions. If you feel thirst, make sure to consume water.</p>

<p>No, your digestion and pH levels won&#39;t be ruined just because you drink a glass of water. You will digest that beef just as good.</p>

<p>I cannot drink anything at least 6 hours after eating.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t understand why you assume that your experience applies to everybody else. I actually find that attitude arrogant. Like saying: Daily reminder that the correct shoe size is 11.</p>
