<div class="md"><p>That link doesn’t say that sugar is more addictive than cocaine, just that it might be addictive. </p>

<p>Saying it’s more addictive than Coke is stupid. Saying it is addictive, however, is factual for some people.</p>

<div class="md"><p>Why are you and that guy taking that comment literally? I just took a fact that sugar is addictive, and made a light comment about it. </p>

<p>Does every such comment has to end with a disclaimer, so as to avoid the &quot;Ackchyually&quot; replies?</p>

<div class="md"><p>It was presumptive of me to take it literally, I apologize for that. </p>

<p>I’ve seen numerous people make that same claim in earnest before and assumed that you meant it literally as well.</p>

<p>Plus, in my defense, you doubled down by providing a link to seemingly back your claim up that didn’t actually back it up.</p>
