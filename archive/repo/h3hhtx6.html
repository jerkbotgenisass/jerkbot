<div class="md"><p>Honestly it might be an example of the philosophy of being good at stupid to the point where it is no longer stupid, if they have genuinely been training with this sort of shit on a regular basis they may be confident that they can do this, my only question though is why? What sport, profession, or even hobby would justify the risks of being so good at this</p>

<div class="md"><p>for yourself. to see the limits of your body. to be fast and strong just to be fast and strong. it also shows a lot of mental fortitude, you would know that if you weren&#39;t a lazy fat fuck. the real question is why fat lazy idiots like you judge these people so harshly.  its like someone who just learned to boil water criticizing chef ramseys passion for cooking</p>

<div class="md"><p>The military press he was doing (minus the punches and kicks) would be good for core and stabilizer muscles if it were done in a safer way. I can imagine a configuration using a bow flex or something similar that you can safely let go of the handles without breaking the machine.</p>

<p>If you were to do this with a weight and pulley system I think the stress of releasing at the top of the lift would be bad. Having it in a flexible tension system may be less damaging especially at lower weights. Having the tension increase as you lift would help get past the difficult part of the lift and apply the most core strength when you are in a more stable position at the end of the lift.</p>
