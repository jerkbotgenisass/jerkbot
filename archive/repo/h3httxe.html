<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I have been doing Strong Lifts 5x5 for about 2 years now. I just realized that it was meant only for beginners, which I may still fall in that category? I can Squat 1.5x of my bodyweight and bench 1.25x of my body weight. Do I need to switch programs or can I still continue doing this? I do all lifts EXCEPT the 1x5 deadlift since I lift at home in my garage and do not have the equipment to do deadlifts here. 5ft10 210lbs ~23-30% bodyfat</p>
