<p>Tell me why starting strength does not have a bad progression scheme and why it does not lack total volume.</p>

<div class="md"><p>While my limited free time is far too precious to be wasted on debunking trolls online (<a href="/u/just-another-scrub">u/just-another-scrub</a>), heres a few excerpts from Practical Programming I could fetch during my restroom break.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>“There is no single repetition scheme that is appropriate for achieving all training goals (Figure 5-1). The number of reps per set is important because different numbers of reps produce different types of adaptations. This is an extremely important  “principle of exercise programming, and it often goes unappreciated by those without a background in the subject, and misinterpreted by those who do.”</p>

<p>”[…]However, the fastest muscular hypertrophy any trainee will ever experience is during his initial novice progression where he uses sets of 5 reps to get strong as rapidly as possible – and therefore to get bigger as fast as possible […] Sets of 12 do not accomplish this objective for a novice as fast or as effectively as 5s do, so in this particular and very common situation, 3 sets of 5 reps works better for hypertrophy than the plan typically used by advanced bodybuilders who have progressed past this phase of training. As we shall see, sets of 5 reps are very useful.”</p>

<p>[…] “High reps, in excess of 15, can be used effectively for such athletes to increase pain tolerance and the ability to contract while fatigued, and sets of 5 reps with heavier weights can be used on alternating workout days to increase absolute strength. Even though neither of these rep schemes directly improves any aspect of oxidative metabolism, both do in fact improve aerobic endurance performance.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>And this is the important paragraph, and I can already read yall trolls minds “bUt WhErEs ThE EvIdEmCe fOr tHis”, umm maybe pick up the book and read the rest of the chapter?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>[…] “But in the final analysis, sets of 5 reps have proven over the decades to be the most useful number of reps per set for strength training. Strength coaches rely on 5s for training lifters from the novice to the world-class levels of training advancement for several reasons. They allow the use of sufficiently heavy weight to be an “effective strength stimulus, without the injury potential of near-1RM loads. They are better for general training purposes than singles across because they allow more technique practice with more reps. They are enough reps that a coach can effectively interact with the lifter during the set, and the lifter can make corrections and embed them into his movement pattern, thus improving technique in real time. When done for 3-5 sets across, they allow the accumulation of enough volume and workload to be an effective endurance and hypertrophy stimulus. For these reasons, successful athletes and lifters will use sets of 5 for their entire careers under the bar.”</p>
