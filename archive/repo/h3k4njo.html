<div class="md"><p>You have decided to listen to the two most unqualified people in this thread.  You should not do that.  Use the belt if you want.  Use the blocks if you want.  Don’t pause at the bottom if you don’t want to.</p>

<p>I’m saying this as someone who is very confident these people you are listening to are not very good squatters.</p>

<div class="md"><p>290 was my PR last year but it’s almost certainly a bit lower right now as I’m deep into a cut.  Goal is 300 by the end of the year.</p>

<div class="md"><p>Great, my PR is 425x2. I’m getting back into the gym after a 6wk hiatus and was squatting <a href="https://imgur.com/a/fj89or3">315x3</a> on Monday. So, seems like you’re less qualified to give advice than me. Hey <a href="/u/R_NEEM">u/R_NEEM</a> pausing your squats can be worthwhile.</p>
