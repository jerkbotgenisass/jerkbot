15M - 123lbs/56 kg - 5’7
As a long distance runner (who’s somewhat skinny) I’d like to gain some lean muscle mass but as I look through more and more threads, I can’t seem to find an answer that suits for me . Currently I’m running ~60 miles/week with some strength training 3x per week for ~45 minutes and though I’m not trying to get “bulky” or “big” I simply want to gain some weight of lean muscle mass . My question is , is this possible to do so and if so what are some tips and points I could use to help me achieve this goal ?</p>

<div class="md"><p>Yes- but you&#39;ll need to consume a lot of protein to do it. Track your macros. I&#39;ve added 15lbs of lean mass while training for ultras over the past 1 1/2 year. You&#39;ll also need to be lifting HARD and frequently.</p>

<p>You&#39;ll also need to really learn about lifting. I highly recommend grabbing a few books on basics of bodybuilding if you want to start to understand the science of lifting and gaining mass. It is absolutely possible. There are also some really great youtube channels on lifting.</p>

<p>Consider adding creatine too. IF you aren&#39;t serious about winning races you may consider dabbling in SARMs, though I personally won&#39;t because they are considered a PED (they&#39;re an anabolic agent- they&#39;d benefit you in gaining mass but not as a runner). If you&#39;re a serious competitor then stay away from SARMs for sure- you don&#39;t want to raise questions about your legitimacy. You should lift for at least a year before going down that road IMO.</p>

<p>*Edit- at your age you absolutely should not use any PEDs under any circumstance. It will screw up your endocrine system.</p>

<p>You can PM me if you want more info on what I&#39;ve done.</p>
