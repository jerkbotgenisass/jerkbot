<p>Also, there&#39;s a <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Fitness/search?&amp;restrict_sr=on">handy search function</a> to your right, and if you didn&#39;t know, you can also use Google to search <a href="/r/Fitness">r/Fitness</a> by using the limiter &quot;site:reddit.com<a href="/r/fitness">/r/fitness</a>&quot; after your search topic.</p>

<p>Other good resources to check first are <a href="http://www.exrx.net/index.html">Exrx.net</a> for exercise-related topics and <a href="https://examine.com/">Examine.com</a> for nutrition and supplement science.</p>
