<div class="md"><p>Nah no pics. Also to be clear I lost a fair bit of that 20 pre Covid from moving across the country and hitting a bit of a slump so it’s not like 50lbs total lol.</p>

<p>My regiment is generally speaking one day each shoulders arms chest back legs, one rotating day depending on what I think I need more of, and one recovery day but I’ll sometimes do some forearm exercises and still do some cardio. That’s obviously the ideal, I have bad weeks but recently I’m proud to say I’ve stuck to it pretty solidly.</p>

<p>I don’t know if all my names of exercises are accurate cause I just learned this stuff from a family friend who used to be a trainer and like I said no gym time for me. I start each exercise with 4 sets of pushups, currently 25 each for 100total, and finish each exercise with either 3 planks or 3 sets of tension sit ups (again my terminology is probably crap but basically only doing the middle 85% of the push-up never fully up and never fully down so you are always at tension), currently at 40 each for 120 total.</p>

<p>For the exercise it’s generally 4 sets of 3 exercises, and obviously it depends on what I’m doing but generally I try to do between 8-15 reps, if I can do more I up the weight, if I can’t do 8 four times steady I’m not ready to up it.</p>

<p>Arms- curls, 21s, hammers, weighted jabs.</p>

<p>Shoulders-shoulder shrugs, rows, this weird thing with your arms out in front of you going up and down lol</p>

<p>Chest- this I actually usually don’t do 3 I just do flat dumbbell press and inclined. I’ll supplement with more push-ups at the start and more sets/reps depending what I’m feeling</p>

<p>Legs- weighted squats/heel raises/lunges/stairs. Basically just maxing my dumbbells and holding them while doing that stuff carefully and slowly. Obviously for these it’s more than 15 per set.</p>

<p>Back- I realized I lied I actually have this ghetto ass “bar” if you can even call it that that I put all my dumbbell weights onto to do deadlifts. Real jank but the weight stays balanced so whatever it works. Then with the dumbbells military press and lateral raises (off the side of the bench I think that’s the name).</p>

<p>Forearms is just forearm curls just kinda using my wrist</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Since you packed on 20 lbs of lean muscle mass before that you must be pretty advanced.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Nah I was just hella scrawny lol. I was like 170, went up to 190, dropped back down to 180, then got bored with Covid and decided to do resistance stuff, now I’m at 215. I’m pretty sure I packed on at least 5 pounds of fat though but I’m still confident the other 30 is muscle. It’s weird I don’t feel heavy but just seeing my body shape be completely different felt weird for a while, and now it’s normal but seeing pictures of myself is what feels weird lol</p>

<p>I read all of this and I have no idea what you&#39;re doing other than that it is not a structured program, so I doubt you gained even a quarter of the muscle you think you did.</p>

<p>I wish I was so confident after declaring that I don&#39;t even know what half the exercises are called.</p>

<div class="md"><p>K well fair enough like I said I don’t take it extremely seriously so how do you go about determining how much of your weight gain is muscle and how much is fat? I haven’t put on any real fat that I can tell compared to what I already had, my diet hasn’t changed, and I’ve put on 35 lbs</p>

<div class="md"><p>I hope you haven&#39;t been discouraged, you were posted on <a href="/r/fitnesscirclejerk">r/fitnesscirclejerk</a> where pseudo fitness intellectuals poke fun at beginners and novices because they need validation. Probably why you got a bit of harassment. I&#39;ve been posted there myself but I have over a decade of lifting experience and have dabbled in competitions (as well as a handful of tertiary grade knowledge lol). So as you can see, not the brightest bunch over there. </p>

<p>The are various methods people can use to determine body fat and muscle composition. A simple way to measure body fat are just skin calipers. This would give you a rough idea of what you&#39;re dealing with.</p>

<p>There are also bodyfat scales which can give you a bit more information but both methods aren&#39;t that accurate.</p>

<p>If you really wanted a solid assessment, look up body composition scanners. Where I live, you can find these at certain gyms and you pay anywhere from $20-50 (aud) to get a reading. <a href="https://imgur.com/UTuV9Bp.jpg">https://imgur.com/UTuV9Bp.jpg</a></p>

<p>As you can see, they&#39;re pretty in depth and give you a lot of information. There&#39;s a margin of error of course, but in my opinion these are the best bang for your buck.</p>

<div class="md"><p>Lol that makes sense they seemed the type. I obviously haven’t gone super in depth on fitness and don’t plan to but that’s because I already do that with guitar and home brewing and my education and whatever games I get into, if i have a spare hour to read something technical it’s already accounted for. It’s the same thing in all those, where the jerk offs with pseudo knowledge are the ones that want to shit on beginners and spend their life defining their existence based on what should really just be a “thing they do” not a lifestyle. That being said for the same reason I definitely agree that there is always a better more accurate way to go about things for better results for sure.</p>

<p>Definitely happy with my results so far and I’ll just keep doing what I’m doing. That’s good to know though that putting on 30lbs and exercising doesn’t necessarily equate to 30lbs of muscle mass. I kinda just looked in the mirror and didn’t see more fat and figure “hey cool muscle”</p>

<div class="md"><p>In my specific thread they had no trouble jerking each other off and making fun of me but when I responded to some individually they got quiet real quick. Most of them don&#39;t understand the most rudimentary statistical dataset and either incorrectly addressed or just ignored the studies I had linked. Don&#39;t get me wrong, a lot of them are strong and and are in great shape - but they seem to think that is enough to make them an expert. </p>

<p>So all in all, they&#39;re basically the douchebags who would laugh at the fat guy in the gym. They give lifters a bad rep so fuck them.</p>

<p>Doing a quick google search for a basic routine with whatever you&#39;ve got (bodyweight, dumbbells etc) would probably be better in both the short and long term like you said. So I recommend doing that whenever you&#39;ve got the time. Regardless, the basic rules of gaining mass is just increasing your caloric intake (the healthier and protein packed the better). You can just do harder variants of bodyweight exercises like push ups and pull ups as you get stronger. You don&#39;t need a gym. Feel free to reach out if you want basic advice and good luck.</p>

<div class="md"><p>Whoah, posting a link to fitnesscirclejerk? It&#39;s a not-so-stealthy child porn ring/shock sub. So... you need to be a pedophile with a camera or somebody who&#39;s into that. Please report postings of that link to mods/admins in the future; I&#39;ve already done so in this case. It&#39;s a CSS thing, and a pretty well-known one at that. Kinda like how a few circlejerks change usernames to reflect a theme, except mirroring other subs cosmetically while the links direct to kiddie porn assuming you&#39;re using some tool (it&#39;s like TOR, I think, but I don&#39;t really pay attention to the shady side of the net - if you&#39;re tech savvy I&#39;d guess you&#39;ve heard of it). So this sub moves around whenever it gets deleted, and it&#39;s up to people reporting it and the users maliciously linking to it to get the admins&#39; attention. I assume they report it to authorities, but these subs keep popping up. I miss the days when at least you knew <a href="/r/creepshots">/r/creepshots</a> would be the disgusting borderline sub instead of having to be wary of every sub you get linked to. Also, most of the links there will attempt to install some nasty viruses on your computer if you don&#39;t have the requisite tool. Unless you&#39;re using VirtualBox or have a trustworthy firewall I&#39;d recommend a virus scan.</p>
