<div class="md"><p>Guys please dont praise his coach for doing this. He is not supposed to lift this much weight with his condition. It will lead into more pain. The most important part of heavy lifting is correct technique. Especially for deadlift. Like it is nice he tries this much and is happy about it but it will lead into more pain. His trainer should know this. With sloppy technique like this he is using muscles that are not supposed to be under this kind of pressure and same goes for his joints. It will lead into serious injuries and lots of pain. It is not matter of one bad rep. Every rep he does without proper technique and this much weight will hurt him.</p>
