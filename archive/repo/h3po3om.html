<div class="md"><p>Hey guys, im 20  and 5’11 and 120lb and few months back I started working out, and i saw some improvement on my chest, biceps and my shoulders and the funny thing is i lost weight instead of gaining it i was (130lb), so my question is that I don’t take any supplements  cause i cant really afford them so can i really get big and gain muscle mass without supplements? And how can i gain weight in a healthy way!?</p>

<p>Side note: gyms are closed in my town so i workout from home, i bench press and deadlift and squat and bicep bar curls band few other exercises using dumbbells, and i run almost every night for few miles</p>

<div class="md"><p>You don&#39;t need a medication. You need to put food in your mouth, chew, and swallow. Wash it down with a glass of milk.  Do this every three hours the entire time you are awake.</p>
