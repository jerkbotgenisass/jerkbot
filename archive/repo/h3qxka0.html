<div class="md"><p>Hi. After 40 hours of reading I am here.</p>

<p>&#x200B;</p>

<p>I realize I can&#39;t do my own program as a beginner, So after reading a lot I decided to follow a mixture of basic mixtures that are extremely similar and add a couple of my own exerices. I also decided to stop being childish and include exercises that most core muscle groups instead of a few.</p>

<p>So please critisize my workout program.</p>

<p>&#x200B;</p>

<p>--</p>

<p>10 - 15m warm-up/stretches.</p>

<p>&#x200B;</p>

<p>squats: 2 reps of 5 ( I have a heavy olympic bar so my legs hurt a lot. Asked and turns out its not that the bar is too heavy, its that I have to get used to it. So I&#39;ll start with 2 and move to 3)</p>

<p>&#x200B;</p>

<p>Barbell rows: 3 reps of 5</p>

<p>&#x200B;</p>

<p>Bench press: 3 reps of 10 (will work towards 15)</p>

<p>&#x200B;</p>

<p>dumbbells fly: 3 reps of 10 (will work towards 15)</p>

<p>&#x200B;</p>

<p>deadlifts: 3 reps of 5</p>

<p>&#x200B;</p>

<p>dumbell curls: 3 reps of 30 ( I know its a lot but I have to increase the reps since the load I have access to is low. I know high load and low reps is better but I don&#39;t have a suitable option now)</p>

<p>&#x200B;</p>

<p>single handed tricep dumbbell extensions: 3 reps of 15</p>

<p>&#x200B;</p>

<p>and finish it off with 3 reps for 3 different abdomment exercises (Havent decided yet)</p>

<p>&#x200B;</p>

<p>Oh, and of course 10-15m stretch in the end.</p>
