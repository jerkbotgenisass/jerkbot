<div class="md"><p>yeah i know. u wouldnt have an argument to make. thats why youve gotta cop out the way ur doing. u know that im right. every single thing about who u r on reddit is douchebaggy and people only suffer u because ur strong and sometimes say stuff that isnt stupid. but if u werent such a tryhard that u could actually delete &quot;fOr pRiVaCy&quot; without immediately telling everyone what ur new account is, nobody would ever listen to u or care that u werent around.</p>

<p>and everybody reading knows it too. thats why this &quot;troll on a burner account&quot; is getting support even tho were in ur safe space.</p>

<p>tell me more about hurt feelings tho ;)</p>
