<div class="md"><p>There’s a reason you’re supposed to do deadlifts in an open space. This is two of those reasons.</p>

<div class="md"><p>He shouldn&#39;t have kept pulling for this lift when he started hitching it for the lock-out. This is a DUMB move and he <em>probably</em> knew better than to keep going with this. As long as it took him, I&#39;m not surprised at all that he blacked out. You can feel that coming when you get to that point, he just chose to ignore it and keep trying... and he paid a heavy toll for it.</p>

<div class="md"><p>I literally can’t push myself hard enough to black out. I always fatigue and just give out before that happens. </p>

<p>Is this a willpower thing?</p>

<div class="md"><p>It&#39;s easier to blackout if you have bigger muscles. I used to be able to push myself to were I start to feel it coming. After I had kids and cut down on training it&#39;s much more rare.</p>

<div class="md"><p>Part of it is, and part of it is limiting your ability to &quot;push&quot;... your belt for example offers resistance that you&#39;re able to push against so that you maintain the pressure in your chest. The limitation is why the biggest lifts are done in a suit as well, it helps maintain intrabdominal pressure which allows you to basically push harder. If you look at Eddie Hall&#39;s 500kg deadlift (start at about 3:55 here <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U4AQlamvFzs">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U4AQlamvFzs</a> ), as soon as he puts it down, he basically passes out as the pressure subsides, Ivan Makarov pulled 550kg (from blocks) here <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=csfnD9Zg99o">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=csfnD9Zg99o</a>  and as he hits the top of his lift he also gets to the point where he about passes out. As soon as you stop pushing, the blood rushes out and your blood pressure bottoms out.</p>

<div class="md"><p>That can’t be healthy. Sounds like it could mess with the brain too if he keeps doing that.</p>

<div class="md"><p>Eddie talks about his aftermath in a different video. He basically had a stroke or something they think, his brain wasn’t right the next few days at all. He probably hemorrhaged to some extent. The nose bleed is that further pressure finally causing the capillaries in his nose to burst. Now imagine your brains effect …. No thanks. Probably not healthy for long term at all.</p>

<div class="md"><p>That was my thoughts exactly lol. I’m not much of a gym guy. I prefer to do my athletics at the basketball court or skatepark with friends so I admittedly have zero experience doing really any kind of deadlifts. But watching those videos made me feel uncomfortable for sure. It just looks sketchy all around. I feel like lifting that kind of weight and pushing so hard then like you said the blood pressure drops when they stop pushing … can’t be good for your heart. The whole thing just seems dangerous to me aside from the fact that you could physically hurt yourself like the original video were commenting on. Sheesh no thanks I’ll stick to my kick flips and shooting 3 pointers lol</p>
