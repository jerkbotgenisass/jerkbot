<div class="md"><p>I mean yeah he’s definitely on roids but you still have to work hard if you take steroids. All they do is  increase the gains you get from working out but you’d till have to exercise to see the effects otherwise you’ll just get fatter. So really it’s a mix of roids and hard work.</p>

<div class="md"><p>You actually don’t have to work at all if you take roids. You can take them and gain 5 pound of muscle a month for free. Whereas a natural lifter with excellent nutrition sleep and hydration will only gain 2-3 pounds. Just a common misconception I wanted to clear up</p>

<div class="md"><p>Yes you can and many people do. That is how steroids work, but clearly I as a man who has been working out naturally for 2 years now would know nothing about that person who downvoted my comment. (Not you) look at famous actors that gain 60 pounds of muscle in a time frame even shorter than that.</p>

<div class="md"><p>Maybe you should read the study you&#39;re referencing? I know precisely which one you&#39;re talking about, and it is used by dumb dumbs every single time this subject comes up to drive home their weak ass point.</p>

<p>Also, don&#39;t flex on two years of working out. There&#39;s lots of fit people on reddit that have been doing that shit for way longer.</p>

<div class="md"><p>Years and years, few breaks here and there. Why is this relevant? You don&#39;t even need to work out to understand this. Steroids won&#39;t make you look like Arnold unless you go out, workout and build new muscles. Steroids are not magical muscle juice and you won&#39;t see any good effect of taking steroids by sitting on the couch all week. Feels moronic to just explain this</p>

<div class="md"><p>You actually have to work a lot harder because it allows you to work harder. </p>

<p>Let&#39;s use your example of 5lbs of muscle a month. The first 2-3 months might be easy but with diminishing returns you have to keep working harder and harder. By the end of your first year just imagine how much food, training, and drugs you would need to do to keep growing at a steady rate</p>

<p>you would need to lift heavier weights, eat more food, do more cardio, and increase the dosages to keep growing. you can&#39;t just take 500mg of test a week your whole bb&#39;ing career</p>
