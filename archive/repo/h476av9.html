<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p><strong>INTRO</strong></p>

<p>Greetings once again Gainers,</p>

<p>I wanted to create a topic to address a question that seems to be coming up frequently on <a href="/r/gainit">r/gainit</a> these days: “why can’t I just eat/drink BLANK?”  Popular blanks include olive oil, straight peanut butter, and massive weight gain shakes, but I’ve seen melted ice cream, seeds, lard, etc.  You get the point: a trainee will fixate on ONE calorie dense food/food-like product and want to know why they can’t just base a diet entirely around it.  As usual, if something sounds too good to be true, it probably is, and the fact the question is getting asked is proof enough that the trainee knows that there must be A reason they can’t do this: they just don’t know WHAT that reason is.</p>

<p><strong>THE PROBLEM</strong></p>

<p>There isn’t anything inherently wrong with getting your nutrition by eating peanut butter out of a jar, drinking olive oil or relying on calorie dense shakes.  These methods HAVE been used in the past by individuals that have grown to be big and strong.  HOWEVER, the population that makes up <a href="/r/gainit">r/gainit</a> and asks these kinds of questions tend to have something in common that said individuals did NOT have: <strong>poorly established eating habits</strong>.  Baring medical issues, the chronically underweight trainee tends to be a poor eater, in terms of regularly consuming quality nutrition, at reasonable intervals, on a consistent basis, via non-deviant means/socially acceptable means.</p>

<p>What do I mean by that last part?  Quite frankly, when someone asks “why can’t I just drink olive oil to gain weight”, I’m flabbergasted.  This is deviant behavior, and would be considered “disordered eating” by many.  Most civilized societies build culture and community around meals, whereas drinking oil out of a bottle would be the activity of an outcast from society.  Though not as abhorrent, eating peanut butter out of a jar vs putting it ON something rings in a similar way, as does subsisting on a diet purely of blended food vs actually going through the ritual of chewing and swallowing solid food (ideally at a table, with silverware, and maybe even other humans nearby).</p>

<p>And this exemplifies the problem with these approaches: a chronically underweight trainee GOT to that point by having poor eating habits.  Employing these methods to gain weight is a band-aid solution.  Yes: it will result in gaining weight, but it will not fix the CAUSE of being underweight: specifically, once again, having poor eating habits.</p>

<p><strong>THE SOLUTION</strong></p>

<p>Much like how you can lift heavier weights through progressive overload, your eating habits can improve through consistent repetition and progressively increasing food consumed when you eat.  One of the issues one observed with new gainers is that they try to massively “overcorrect” previous caloric intake, jumping from a daily intake of 1000 to 3000+, typically by means of these single source calorie dense foods.  Along with the anticipated degree of gastrointestinal distress this brings, it in no way actually solves the issue.</p>

<p>Instead, make a goal to eat at least 3 REAL meals a day.  Try to actually engage in a ritual of meal eating: have your food on a plate, at a table, sitting down and focusing on eating.  Have some sort of protein, some sort of fat, and some sort of carbohydrate at each meal to start.  A vegetable alongside that would be just fine.  As you get further down the line, you can play with macronutrient composition.  Does everything have to be kept separate?  Absolutely not.  Have a sandwich: carbs in the bread, protein in the meat, fats in the cheese/spread.  Or a PBJ, if you’re not into animal products.  Have a stir fry.  Just have a MEAL. </p>

<p>In between meals, feel free to have snacks, but have snacks that a normal human would consider to be a snack.  A handful of walnuts?  Great choice.  Some dried fruit?  Absolutely!   A stick of butter?  Nope: try again!  </p>

<p>Once these eating habits are established, you can progressively overload by adding more food to the meals (bigger portions, 2 different kinds of proteins/carbs/fats per meal, etc), add more meals to the day (I think eating a meal right before bed is one of the best “secrets” to weight gain that gets overlooked), or adding an extra snack.  You could EVEN start to implement SMALL shakes at this point to get in some extra protein and nutrients, but the majority of your nutrition should come from the meals and NOT the shake.</p>

<p>In doing this, you’ll have developed the eating habits necessary to ensure a lifetime of success in whatever physical goals you desire.  You won’t be relying on hacks and shortcuts, but instead be able to adapt and modify as needed.  Need to lose weight?  No need for fat burners, stimulants, tapeworms, etc: we’ll just eat FEWER meals or less food at each meal.  Need to gain?  We’ll reverse that.</p>

<p><strong>WHAT IF I DON’T HAVE TIME FOR ALL OF THAT?</strong></p>

<p>We are, thankfully, all gifted the same 24 hours in a day, and we can decide how we’re going to implement it.  Meal prep goes a LONG way in setting one up for success.  If you want a solid primer on basic meal prep for gaining, check out John Berardi’s “Scrawny to Brawny”, wherein he discusses a ritual of preparing multiple meals at once to set up a trainee for a solid day of eating.  </p>

<p>Not every meal has to be extravagant.  A sandwich is just fine.  Microwave cooked eggs can be a fantastic breakfast.  Cold leftovers from the night before can work: just meet the goal of improving your eating habits.  </p>

<p><strong>CONCLUSION</strong></p>

<p>There’s a time and a place for extreme means of calorie accumulation, and that time and place is NOT at the start of your weight gain journey.  Focus on establishing solid eating habits, improving your ability to cook for yourself if needed, such that you address the root cause behind being underweight.  Relying on single source calorie dense foods is not actually solving the problem, but simply delaying the time it takes to reach an adequate solution.</p>

<p>Your summary is a good one. He wrote a wall of text to basically say “Few people do that, so you shouldn’t either.” What a disappointment. Lol</p>

<div class="md"><p>At least someone gets it. The point of the sub is to help struggling people gain weight, and the way to do that is to empirically determine how to gain muscle effectively. Accepted social customs aren&#39;t relevant at all.</p>

<p>The &quot;sHuT uP bOoK nErD&quot; responses are pathetic and indicative of the kind of mentality of people who fail to gain weight but tell everyone they &quot;eat a shit load&quot; and refuse to take an objective approach.</p>

<p>On what grounds do you think you can speak for the subreddit, as a whole? </p>

<p>I don&#39;t always agree with everything MythicalStrength says -- but I&#39;m 1000x times more likely to listen to and think about what he has to say than a user whose name I don&#39;t recognize who thinks chugging olive oil is a pro-tip.</p>
