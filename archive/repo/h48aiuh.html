<div class="md"><p>Obviously I&#39;m being a bit hyperbolic, but which drugs are prescribed for people who are not extremely obese? As far as I know, they are only prescribed to people for who are morbidly obese and desperately need to lose weight for health reasons. Why do you need drugs? Just to be lean?</p>

<div class="md"><p>Anything that works very well is at least somewhat illegal or somewhat dangerous/detrimental. Very high doses of caffeine and nicotine may work, somewhat dangerous/detrimental. Ephedrine supplements may work, maybe illegal, somewhat dangerous. Various types of amphetamines work, illegal and dangerous. Fen-phen works, only available through a doctor and dangerous. </p>

<p>High volume vegetables and lots of water, a little caffeine: healthy for you, legal, not dangerous.</p>

<p>Bullshit. There are definitely illegal weight loss drugs.</p>

<p>Funny how my friends and colleagues in the medical field stay away from medication when losing weight then. I must be imagining stuff.</p>

<p>Let me frame this differently.</p>

<p>Let&#39;s say you&#39;re a general practitioner and a patient comes to you with problems regarding anxiety. Step one is talking with them about the issue. If going into treatment, the first step would be some sort of therapy - not a benzodiazepine.</p>

<p>Similar to how you need to at least <em>try</em> to eat less instead of going for drugs immediately.</p>

<p>Put down the fork, don&#39;t pick up the proverbial alprazolam as a step 1.</p>

<p>edit: alprazolam is xanax for our friends across the pond</p>

<div class="md"><p>Fuck this hippie bullshit about big pharma and being anti-drug. Medicine helps to successfully cure people. Self help doesn’t work and people will waste their time and effort to try and treat themselves with garbage therapy. Doctors don’t give people therapy they give them drugs cause they know it works. Therapy is something you do on the side</p>

<p>Do you have any background in medical diagnostics?</p>

<p><strong>You have no fucking clue what you&#39;re talking about,</strong> you just want a magic pill to solve your problems because you&#39;re too weak-willed to admit you&#39;re eating too much.</p>

<div class="md"><p>There are lots of different things you can leverage for appetite suppression all with their own ranges of side effects and downsides. Most of them however are not worth it for the majority of people. Its better to structure a healthy, high volume low calorie diet that allows you to eat until you&#39;re full and stay within your goal calorie range.</p>
