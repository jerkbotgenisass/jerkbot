<p>That&#39;s because no study would ever tell people to lift with bad form to prove that it causes injury, and nobody would participate in a study like that.</p>

<div class="md"><p>Actually there are and we know that the vast majority of lifting injuries aren’t caused by improper form/technique but instead improper load management.  Also, don’t take this the wrong way, but you are a beginner and probably shouldn’t be trying to correct people in the daily.</p>

<div class="md"><p>I&#39;ve been lifting for two years so I&#39;m not a beginner. I seriously injured myself due to improper form caused by postural issues which I&#39;m working on with help from a physiotherapist. I lost a lot of progress due to this injury and now I&#39;m paranoid about my form, so if you read my post history you might have got the impression that I&#39;m a beginner but his is not the case at all.</p>

<div class="md"><p>I would absolutely consider someone with 2 years of experience and most of that time rehabbing from an injury to be a beginner.  It’s not a knock on your skills or ability but you simply don’t have the experience or credentials.  Form injuries can happen but they aren’t the most common injury types and most injuries that people blame on “bad form” are actually people lifting heavier than they should for more reps than they’re capable of.</p>

<p>As an example, you see people doing stupid stuff with heavy weights just goofing off that would easily injure people less strong than them.  It’s bad form, but it isn’t injuring the stronger person.  Why?  Because it’s not a heavy load for them.</p>

<div class="md"><p>In my post I said that no study would tell people to lift with bad form for the purpose of seeing whether or not they got injured. My lifting experience is irrelevant because my comment was about the ethics of doing a study like that and had nothing to do with lifting. Nobody is going to participate in a study to see if they get injured, you don&#39;t need to be a bodybuilder to see that.</p>

<p>For some reason my comment bothered you enough to read my post history and attack my lifting experience, so I&#39;m going to put this question to you. Don&#39;t you think that someone with first hand experience of being injured due to bad form like myself is far more qualified than you to talk about this topic?</p>

<p>Now shut the fuck up telling me what I&#39;m qualified to post about, you don&#39;t know anything about me.</p>
