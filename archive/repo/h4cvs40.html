<div class="md"><p>Unpopular opinion but the obsession with the wiki programs on this sub is nauseating. Don&#39;t get me wrong, they&#39;re all proven and get results. But for someone who&#39;s just starting out, they might see it and get overwhelmed or not have the time to do it and track progress. </p>

<p>I always see beginners asking questions here and then every reply is &quot;Read the wiki, follow program, end of discussion&quot;. It just ends any potential for having a dialogue about fitness. I think the better advice is to start off doing exercises that you enjoy and move onto a proper program later. Working out should be fun and starting a strict program from day 1 just sucks the fun out of it and most people are very unlikely to actually stick to it (in my opinion).</p>
