<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Do you enjoy advertising featuring real women or would you rather we go back to all model types?</p>

<p>Edit:  I’m not just talking about obese women. I’m talking about everyday body types and not super skinny models who have been edited to look like someone that you would not see in everyday life.</p>

<div class="md"><p>Denying it isn&#39;t either. Obesity is dangerous for your health, but shaming overweight people doesn&#39;t do any good. Telling someone &quot;hey, we love you, we acknowledge your existence and you&#39;re more than just your body type&quot; is very different from &quot;obesity is fantastic, let&#39;s all put on weight!&quot; And I say this as a slim man with no skin in this game.</p>

<div class="md"><p>That’s simply not true. So many medications cause weight gain, especially depression meds such a large part of the population take. Also there are a lot of medical conditions as well, so don’t act like it’s just an anomaly.</p>

<div class="md"><p>They cause it?  How?  Do the turn people into zombies that can’t control how much they eat?  All I hear are excuses.  I get people are stressed and depressed, but ultimately, those people can put the fork down and learn to count calories if they want to.</p>

<div class="md"><p>All I hear is a highly uneducated person.  Have you not ever seen weight gain listed as a side effect of medications?  It often has nothing to do with what you eat but how your brain receptors identify hunger and fullness as well as how your body processed the food it eats when on those medications.</p>

<div class="md"><p>Science says that genetics may account for as much as 80% of your adult weight/shape. There&#39;s no genetic pre-disposition for becoming a smoker. (Also, as person who smokes from time to time, &quot;shaming&quot; doesn&#39;t stop me from smoking. Taxing tobacco &amp; making it a financial burden helps. So does the fact that I just feel physically shitty when I smoke, even though I find it mentally relaxing.) </p>

<p>There have also been a ton of studies showing that people who are a bit &quot;overweight&quot; actually tend to be healthier than people who are underweight. We&#39;re not talking about people tipping the scales at 600 pounds who can&#39;t get out of bed without assistance. A 5&#39;5&quot; woman who weighs 175 pounds might be in peak physical condition. There&#39;s also &quot;skinny fat,&quot; people who look slim &amp; don&#39;t weigh much, but eat terrible diets that have wreaked havoc on their metabolic systems. People have really drunk the Kool-Aid on there being an inherent causation relationship between weight &amp; health, &amp; it&#39;s just not supported by science. You have no idea what&#39;s going on with someone&#39;s cholesterol or arteries just by looking at them. &amp; even if there was a direct relationship, you can still go ahead &amp; blame a broken health care system for spiraling health care costs. If your premiums go up, blame the health insurance companies, not the guy across the hall who seems to be hitting the Big Macs pretty hard lately.</p>

<div class="md"><p>Calories in/Calories out is the only thing you need to know about weight loss.  You could make the argument that 80% have genetics that make them susceptible to food addiction, but that’s a different conversation. </p>

<p>If you eat less calories than your body uses over the long run, you will lose weight.  If not, they should document it and send it to medical professionals because they just proved the laws of thermodynamics wrong.  I’d bet that 80% of the population is either doesn’t care,  are lying to themselves about their caloric intake, or just don’t know how to read a nutritional label.</p>

<div class="md"><p>I&#39;m just passing along the most recent science. &amp; I&#39;m not saying 80% of the population is overweight/obese. I&#39;m saying that scientists have been trying to understand standard deviations in body shape/size (especially in light of the fact that some people can be very healthy at relatively high BMIs, while other people have catastrophic metabolic disorders at much lower BMIs), &amp; research indicates that it&#39;s possible that genetics may account for as much as 80% of it. Meaning, if you are a slim, healthy, strong person, your personal genetics, which you have no control over whatsoever, might be 80% of the reason, &amp; not the fact that you love salads or hit the gym three times a week or whatever.</p>

<p>It&#39;s also worth noting that 100 years ago, a lot of doctors thought germs were made-up. Science has come a long way since then, but let&#39;s not pretend we&#39;ve cracked it. Calories in/calories out is a decent rule of thumb, but it doesn&#39;t explain why two people can eat the exact same diet &amp; follow the exact same exercise routine &amp; achieve two very different results in terms of weight/fitness/strength/measureable health markers. &amp; that goes for whether their diets are categorically healthful or not.</p>

<div class="md"><p>Metabolic differences between people exist.  Not denying that.  But even in your example, if it was two males of the same age, height, and current weight, the differences in their daily metabolic needs are going to be negligible.  If you put them on the same caloric deficit and found that one was losing weight faster, you would know that the other has a slightly lower Total Daily Energy Expenditure, and would have to lower their caloric intake to lose weight.  </p>

<p>Obviously people aren’t going to be able to compare themselves to another person like that, but you can get a rough estimate of your TDEE with an online calculator.  Then you can track your calories and adjust for yourself personally.  </p>

<p>3500 calories = 1 lb of fat.  Eat 500 cals under your estimated TDEE per day and you should lose 1 pound a week.  As long as you aren’t lying to yourself about your calorie intake, you can easily do the math and find out your metabolic rate.</p>
