Avatar Korra changed my body positivity - for the better

<div class="post">
<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Let me start at the beginning. I am blessed by my father’s farmer genes of getting muscular pretty quickly. It’s easy for me to loose and gain muscle. From the age of 9, I was on the swim team, and got teased for how “buff” I was. My traps and legs are pretty thick naturally, and my shoulder/back/arm/ab muscles got shredded from training for my events (100 breast and 100 free), which are “sprinting” events. I’ve never been able to do endurance events because I have asthma. I stopped training in high school because I was so worried I didn’t look womanly enough, and because I wanted to focus on academics. </p>

<p>I’ve always had a bit of a frustration with my body, because I love feeling strong, but I am self-conscious about my muscles. </p>

<p>In college, I started only doing yoga occasionally and I biked a lot just to try and stay trim. At 24, I started training for a 5k and collapsed from an acute asthma attack. My doctor said shouldn’t attempt endurance sports, and that I should find a salt water (non-chlorinated) pool which has been really great at not triggering my asthma before. </p>

<p>So I’ve been trying to swim more since then, but I get discouraged when I just keep gaining more and more muscle and staying at 25-30% body fat. My doc says I’m in the ideal weight range for my age/height, and told me not to worry about losing weight. But I wasn’t happy with the way I looked. </p>

<p>So I watched Avatar Korra earlier this year in the pandemic, right as I was getting complacent and not working out as much as I should because my pool closed. </p>

<p>And fuck. </p>

<p>She’s a badass, has a purpose in life, has complex emotions, is super smart, is a little stubborn and has to work through her issues, has multiple love interests, etc. and she’s got real shoulders. She’s relatable emotionally. And she’s muscled. And without being extremely low BFP and defined either, like most “goals” pics I see. I’ve never seen representation before for my body type in anything I’ve watched. </p>

<p>I’ve felt so much better about working out, I even find myself getting excited about the thought of getting swole :) </p>

<p>My new goal is Korra/Amazon woman and I’m loving exercising in a way I’ve not felt since I was a kid. </p>

<p>How do y’all feel about having media representation, and a body idol, for what is actually achievable in your own body?</p>

<p>Also I’d love any recommendations for “real life” strong women who look like Korra - I want a goal board to keep me motivated :)</p>

<div class="md"><p>It&#39;s two main things. First, crossfit encourages people to do dangerous moments like high rep olympic lifts to failure, which is a great way to wreck your back, or those silly kipping pullups, which are a great way to wreck your shoulders. Second, the people they have teaching these dangerous moments are completely unqualified and very poorly trained.</p>

<p>In the end the only thing croosfit is good for is getting people hurt.</p>

<div class="md"><p>I didn&#39;t recommend doing Crossfit, I said it was full of strong and powerful women! Some of the fittest people on the planet are crossfitters, and I know several people who do it and they don&#39;t get injured any more than other athletes. But I agree that some of the training methods can be unsafe, and if proper technique isn&#39;t taught could be dangerous.</p>

<p>30 downvotes for saying check out Crossfit... wow, you guys are so open minded.</p>

<div class="md"><p>You got downvotes for saying check out crossfit because that is bad advice. If the people you know who do crossfit haven&#39;t been injured yet they will be, or they will start to feel all the damage done in 5-10 years. Nobody should do crossfit.</p>

<div class="md"><p>I&#39;m sure crossfit has changed many lives for the better... anything that gets people moving and focusing on fitness is good in my opinion.</p>

<p>Too much dogmatic bullshit in the fitness world. </p>

<p>No point in me commenting on this anymore, I&#39;m not trying to change anyone&#39;s opinion, I was just trying to point the OP to some strong women as she asked.</p>

<p>Peace ✌</p>

<div class="md"><p>All you need is to look at them trying to see who can do the most kipping pullups to know they&#39;re an absolute joke, they don&#39;t serve you if your goal is to gain strength, gain endurance (you know what, I&#39;ll give them a quarter of a point for this because crossfit&#39;s better than doing nothing, but literally anything else will help you gain more endurance), or improve health. It doesn&#39;t serve anyone&#39;s goals, unless those goals are to fuck around.</p>

<div class="md"><p>I can take a shot at this.</p>

<p>Crossfit makes up events, gives people points for the events, and then declares them the fittest people on the planet...</p>

<p>Conveniently forgetting about the actual fittest people on the planet who do real sport with sensible rules that isn&#39;t made up nonsense.. You know.. The fucking Olympics.</p>

<p>Now I&#39;m not saying Crossfit is particularly terrible for the average person. Nice to belong to a group.</p>

<p>But its easy to understand why it is ridiculed.</p>

<p>I mean, just look at the pullups they do.</p>

<p>Washed up loser Olympics.</p>
