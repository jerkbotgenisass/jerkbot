<p>I started Keto on June 28 with the goal of dropping about 30 pounds. I’m eating about 1800 calories per day. I work out 6 days per week (10-20 minutes of core/upper body strength training, 1-mile run, and a quick Peloton climb ride). I’m very pleased with the progress I’ve made thus far. Do you think the workout regimen I have described will prevent be from looking skinny fat at the end of this? See attached photos.   </p>

<div class="md"><p>No need for cardio, rather focus on resistance training. If your goal is not to become skinny fat.</p>
