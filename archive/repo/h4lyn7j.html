<div class="md"><p>Question about clothes</p>

<p>When I go to the gym, i&#39;m wearing polyester type clothes like nike, underarmor and gymshark sell.</p>

<p>On instagram and online, i&#39;ve seen some people at the gym wearing joggers hoodies and all things like that.</p>

<p>How does this work? Don&#39;t these kinds of clothes absorb sweat and become terrible to wash? I&#39;m curious.</p>
