<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Firstly, allow me to educate those who are unfamiliar with the gym/broscience lingo. </p>

<p>Personal Record (PR) - Definition: A Personal Record for an exercise movement.</p>

<p>1 Rep Max (1RM) - The maximum weight you can complete an exercise for 1 Rep.</p>

<p>Example: The Vegan that made this post has a 1RM of 405 lbs in the barbell squat, making it his brand new PR. He also has another squatting PR of 315 lbs for 10 reps. He probably could have done more.</p>

<p>I&#39;m about 5&#39;7 weighting in between 209-212 with a low 20-ish % fat. Fluctuates, y&#39;all know this. Humble brag. I&#39;m stronger than most of these omnis I see at the gym.</p>

<div class="md"><p>&quot;Humble&quot; lol. True.</p>

<p>I go for at least 2 large meals a day,  late breakfast and an afternoon lunch. I also have plant based protein shakes/drinks through the day and maybe small meals like a bowl of wild rice and tofu or beans. I always train in the evening so I enjoy having a full day of food before working out. I enjoy carbs, some people want to avoid it. I feel fine. People see me, and im that &quot;built&quot; guy. I have rice usually with my meals. I enjoy tofu, lentils, quinoa, chickpeas, black beans, corn, tomatoes, green peas, chia seeds I also do green leaf salads; kale, spinach; sweet pea leaves, baby bok choy leaves.I combine these ingredients differently, depending on what is available. I take a vegan multivitamin but just 1/3 of the serving size. It recommends 3 capsules but I just take one. I also eat blueberries, bananas, mangos. I live in Florida so coconuts are a common &quot;snack&quot; im into a few times of the month. Mmmm that Coconut water and those coconut boogers. Yummy ðŸ˜‹</p>

<p>I&#39;m not really going for a crazy low body fat %, I don&#39;t want to be shredded. I enjoy food too much. It&#39;s not what im worried about. I like deadlifting and squatting and just in general moving relatively heavy weights. My cardio has been getting better since I started focusing on it more in the past 2 months. But overall, I consider myself a strong individual. And that argument that &quot;Vegans don&#39;t get enough nutrition for gym gains&quot; is just absurd. The weight I can move is just way better compared to the majority of people I see at the gym. And some I know who eat meat or any other animal products.</p>

<p>I&#39;m also a Personal Trainer. And I&#39;ve been a gym rat for more than 10 years. I&#39;m 28 now.</p>

<div class="md"><p>Not all people have the same goals as you. I know meat eaters that squat triple their weight and are younger than you (and much lighter). Your logic makes no sense. Everyone is different, meat eater, vegan, short, tall, fat, skinny. </p>

<p>Stop comparing yourself to others. Stop trying to push others down to pull yourself up.</p>

<div class="md"><p>they&#39;re just pointing out that the stereotype of &#39;vegan = weak&#39; is false, and it is an unhealthy stereotype... its a good thing.</p>

<div class="md"><p>It is, but Iâ€™ve never seen anyone say something dumb like that. Why not tell us of your accomplishment? Why does it have to be DESPITE being vegan? Why do we gotta bring up the negative comments all the time and let them keep on living? Why not forget them?</p>
