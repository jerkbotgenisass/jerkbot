<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Hello,</p>

<p>New to the sub. So, I apologize if this was brought up on here often. </p>

<p>I exercise at a boutique fitness place that is quite intense. I usually burn around 800-1100 calories per hour class. I’ve been doing this for 4 months now and it’s starting to get me down.</p>

<p>I take 3 classes a week but I’m not recovering. I thought I was just I was just over doing it and decided to take a week off to recover. But when I returned I was just as fatigued as before. I have trouble getting out of bed. Walking up a flight of stairs is unbearable. </p>

<p>I’m taking the correct vitamins and protein. I get 8-9 hours of sleep. I well hydrated. I even drink Pedialyte occasionally to make sure I have all my electrolytes.</p>

<p>I’m 280 Lbs 6”4. I haven’t lost any weight since starting. But I believe I gained a lot of muscles.</p>

<p>Does anyone know what’s wrong with me? Is this common?</p>

<div class="md"><p>You can&#39;t afford medical insurance but boutique fitness place is ok. </p>

<p>You are about 80Lbs overweight and doing 1100/hour calorie exercise? Jesus Christ. In 4 months you likely developed a serious heart enlargement causing irregular functionality of valves and perhaps a few more arterial abnormalities that prevent your cardiovascular system to provide sufficient blood flow. </p>

<p>You are very close to having heart failure it seems. Stop physically exhausting yourself, get medical insurance and see a doctor ASAP. It could save your life.</p>
