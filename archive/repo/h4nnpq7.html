<div class="md"><p>Lol yes.</p>

<p>The guy pulling 700+ is ignorant, not the 170lb dude on Sarms.</p>

<p>I have read plenty on the subject. But better yet, I&#39;ve put that reading into practice and achieved a strong pull myself.</p>

<p><a href="https://youtube.com/shorts/e-i3SIrRHio?feature=share">Here&#39;s me pulling 747 lb sumo</a></p>

<p>And <a href="https://youtube.com/shorts/_qkHLHlidFo?feature=share">here&#39;s me pulling 664 conventional</a> </p>

<p>Both videos taken within the last week.</p>

<p>Maybe you should go do some deadlifts, instead of just thinking about them.</p>

<p>Looking up during deadlifts is perfectly fine <a href="/u/bl0bsi">/u/bl0bsi</a></p>

<p>You frequently comment in subs about sarms and PEDS.</p>

<p>I&#39;m 35, natural, and have been lifting for over 20 years. </p>

<p>Lmao, I knew you were going to quote rip before you even posted this comment. </p>

<p>Rip is a fucking dumbass, and has never trained any high level strength athletes.</p>

<p>I&#39;d say my deadlift form is pretty fucking good, &quot;perfect?&quot; Of course not. Because perfect form doesn&#39;t exist. But at least it&#39;s not 5 plates after 16 years lmao</p>

<p>OP&#39;s head angle is fine</p>
