<div class="md"><p>I think that‚Äôs an easy way to dismiss something we can‚Äôt easily understand, as of right now. Especially considering the massive expense and difficulty of doing worthwhile studies on digestion and various highly specific elimination diets.</p>

<p>Here‚Äôs where I‚Äôm willing to buy that this is real for some people. In the world of dog food, there are products labeled as ‚Äúlimited ingredient.‚Äù Manufacturers like this label because it sounds like ‚Äúnatural‚Äù or otherwise sounds positive to buyers. </p>

<p>‚ÄúLimited ingredient‚Äù is also more accurately referred to as ‚ÄúSingle protein.‚Äù That‚Äôs not as attractive on a package but actually describes the product. </p>

<p>All of this exists for one bizarre reason. Some dogs (honestly quite a lot of dogs) develop or inherit (no one fucking knows how or why) a strange allergy in which having more than one type of meat in their regular diet will cause them insane discomfort in the form of itching. My dog Fred will chew his tail tip to a bloody nub. </p>

<p>If you‚Äôve ever seen a dog that scratches themselves to the point of damage, this is very frequently the resolution. </p>

<p>My dogs eat beef. Only beef. Their food formulas are beef based, their treats are beef based, (or peanut butter) any food they eat with animal in it is coming exclusively from cows. </p>

<p>It works.</p>

<p>If I feed them duck or venison, or whatever, even just once, Fred will reliable start chewing his tail off or biting at his ass, etc. I can go with any meat as long as it‚Äôs the only meat. They seem to happiest with beef long term, and there‚Äôs loads of products to support that. </p>

<p>No one knows why this allergy exists or why this solves it. But it works and the dogs surely aren‚Äôt dealing with a placebo effect. </p>

<p>And that‚Äôs my point. If dogs can experience this insane allergy from having meat variety, it‚Äôs entirely plausible to me that some people have an allergy to vegetables in general, or anything non meat. </p>

<p>And there are people out there who appear to have every bit of earnest conviction that eating this way has changed their lives dramatically for the better in ways that other therapies have not. But I don‚Äôt think it makes sense to suggest that this applies to a broad spectrum of people, there‚Äôs just not enough info. </p>

<p>I‚Äôm not going to dismiss the idea, however I think people should be curious of anything promoted as curing everything and solving all your problems.</p>

<div class="md"><p>thks for this. we&#39;re not selling anything and our subreddit doesn&#39;t make grand claims about what the diet can do, we&#39;re there to help ppl that want to try it. all it can do is fix a problem if it was caused by the one or more of the plant foods they were eating. </p>

<p>fatty meat is just food, but people get pretty flipped out about it. </p>

<div class="md"><p>The thing is, those subs promote a lot of absolute nonsense. Just blatant stupid bullshit. Even if the sub itself isn‚Äôt doing it directly, it‚Äôs not exactly being removed. </p>

<p>And yet you‚Äôre also cultivating an echo chamber by refusing participation to anyone who doesn‚Äôt buy into the narrative, like just the suggestion of actually consulting a doctor and taking their advice. </p>

<p>No one ever believes this. We mock and ridicule what we perceive as idiocy, and your subreddit is a reliable source for that. Go figure. If you like the reputation  that people think you‚Äôre stupid, I have no idea what to say.</p>
