<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Hey guys. I am in search of help and advise on what I should do for a body type like this. My goal is not to get big and buff(Deyzel etc) but to be lean and muscular (etc Canelo). It will mean the world to me if anybody here can give me advise on my diet and workouts that will be specific for the state of my body in the pictures. Thank you</p>

<p>Stats: 5’7 138 pounds</p>

<div class="md"><p>There is nothing unusual about your body type other than being on the short side. If I were you I would
Bulk up and get as muscular as you can since yoir height will
Always be an issue</p>

<div class="md"><p>I’ve always wanted to go for that lean and fit body and in my personal take going that route will help with the perception of making me look more slender/taller as opposed to big and stout since as you pointed out my height is an issue</p>

<div class="md"><p>You’ll just look shrimpy being lean. Shorter guys need to pack on the muscle IMO so they can stand up for themselves and their ladies</p>

<p>I dated a 5’7” guy a couple years ago and We got harassed at a comedy club- a table of drunks called me a slut- and he just sat there. What could he do? Nothing! So I no longer date small guys- even tho I find them cute</p>

<div class="md"><p>The question isn’t what could he do, but what SHOULD he do? And the answer is exactly nothing. You don’t address stupid drunk remarks with violence.</p>

<p>That’s coming from someone who’s 6’3, 220lbs and trained in Brazilian jiu-jitsu and judo. </p>
