<div class="md"><p>After losing 60lbs over the last year I decided to join a gym to supplement my at home body weight exercises. I am losing motivation as I feel I&#39;ve hit my goal and Im asking myself &quot;Now what&quot;? I have been running 3-5miles daily and my knees are beginning to complain. I started bulking/weight lifting along with crossfit exercises but realized that aesthetic has never been what Im after and I was only looking for the next personal achievement. I am happy with where I am now my question is how do I stay where I am long term?</p>

<div class="md"><p>Knees: instead of landing on your heel, try landing on your midsole or better the fore foot. This will use more of your tendons as springs to reduce the force of landing. </p>

<p>I changed the way I ran years ago and very rarely do I have problems. Running off road is also a huge help. Uneven surfaces mean your whole skeleton and muscle chain has to work in different ways for every step. </p>

<p>Running too fast will also make injuries more likely, so try having a few long, slow runs in between your 3-5 milers.</p>

<div class="md"><p>I was running a consistent 7:30 mile time and pushed myself for a couple weeks to get down to 6:38. It was an accomplishment but now Im not even sure I could run a 7:30 again. This is about when the pain started.</p>

<div class="md"><p>Sounds like a running injury. Slow down, try 8:30 - 9 minute miles. You still get the benefits of a run, it just takes a bit longer. </p>

<p>I&#39;m early 40s and don&#39;t plan on giving up running. The mental health benefits are worth it at least.</p>

<div class="md"><p>Thats where im at too. I have slowed my pace to around 9min as well. Im going to stop running daily and try 3-4 times a week with cycling in between. The mental health aspect is the most important part. It gives me the motivation to keep working</p>

<div class="md"><p>Preface by saying that I am 66 years old. That being said, you likely do NOT know any 66 year old men that can do 10 handstand push-ups. When I travel and don’t have access to my home weights, I do my travel routine - 5 sets of 60 push-ups; 5 sets of 200 crunches; and various calisthenics in between sets. </p>

<p>So, when I tell you to QUIT running, I know what I am talking about; and more important, it is the worst thing for your knees, hips, feet and other lower body joints. In effect, think of your body as a vehicle . . . Basically, you have a certain amount of mileage for the vehicle and parts. By the by, I was a runner . . . a damn good one. Fortunately, I came across some very good physiology articles about running that convinced me to stop doing it after I turned 45. There are plenty of other aerobic options available that don’t do near the damage running will do long term. Take care.</p>

<div class="md"><p>Someone once told me smart people learn from their mistakes and wise people learn from others mistakes. Im going to take your advice as you are not the first person to say this. I often see people in their 50s and 60s still running. How do they do it?</p>

<div class="md"><p>That&#39;s just survivorship bias.  You see people in that age bracket still running because they&#39;re the ones who were able to keep doing it without falling apart.  All the others got hurt and quit.  I have to run for my work (military) but only train the run leading up to a PT test.  I get my TDEE up through step count and build a base of cardio with lower impact exercise.</p>

<div class="md"><p>That’s why I don’t buy the whole “your body is a vehicle that only has a certain mileage” analogy. We’re not machines; we are adaptable organisms. Your tissues are able to adapt to stress. The same mechanisms that allow you to get bigger muscles also keep your joints healthy. Don’t stop running just because. You said in an earlier post you can feel the running in your knees. THATS a different story. Listen to your body obviously, but don’t stop running just because you reach some arbitrary age.</p>

<div class="md"><p>I can also attest. I do not run, I walk about 10,000 steps per day on any given day. That is basically the only amount of cardio you need unless your goal is to be a distance runner. </p>

<p>If you really enjoy cardio look into an elliptical machine or even stationary biking if really need be. Both are lower impact than running and will still give you a great workout.</p>

<div class="md"><p>Just genetically predisposed I guess (another way of saying they’re lucky). By the by, great job on your physique, I.e., you’re already 99.9% heads and tails above everyone else your age. It’s become part of your life. If you’re anything like me, it’s an enjoyable part of your life, e.g., I have traveled to 45 plus countries, including an around the world trip in 2013. I also retired early at 2007. Regardless of work or adventures - I always made room for exercise.</p>
