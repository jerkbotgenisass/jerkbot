<div class="md"><p>You arms and shoulders look great. You could probably use more pec development. The real area to focus on is your legs. Your quads don’t look proportional to your upper body.
You sound like you may be overtraining too. Six days is too frequent for recovery. That may be why your are regressing. If you keep overtraining you will actually get smaller. 
You should go to a back/chest, arms/shoulders and legs split. Do not work out more than 2-3 times per week. The best thing you could do for yourself is take a 10-14 day layoff from training. You will come back stronger and start making gains.
Something else you need to understand is that not training legs hurts upper body development. This has to do with systemic hypertrophy. When you do big compound movements like squats and deadlifts you stimulate whole body growth. The larger stressful lifts like squats stimulate testosterone and growth hormone release which affect the entire body.</p>

<p>The creators of many great programs disagree with you. But let’s listen to a random guy with no credentials on reddit</p>

<div class="md"><p>I’m a certified personal trainer. But don’t take that as evidence. Read Mike Mentzer, Dr. Doug McGuff or even Dorian Yates. If one is working at a high intensity (meaning sets taken to failure or close to it), he can’t recover using a high weekly training frequency. Unless of course one is chemically enhanced. If you are training that frequently (5-6 times per week), are you getting stronger? You should be up a rep or two or up in weight every one or two workouts. If you’re not, what are you doing? Getting weaker? If you want bigger muscles you have to get stronger.</p>
