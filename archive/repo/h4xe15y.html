<div class="md"><p>You always hear not to lift with your back, but that&#39;s what deadlifting is right? Is it okay just because of the form or because you control the weight, or something else? Or is it just a dumb saying?</p>

<div class="md"><p>Your lower back is used to keep your core rigid, but the deadlift is a hip-hinge movement which means the prime movers are the hammies and glutes.  Quads are also being used to get the bar off the ground.</p>

<div class="md"><p>No, the saying applies to the deadlift too. The majority of work during a deadlift should be done with your legs.</p>

<div class="md"><p>It&#39;s pretty dumb because yes of course you use your back. But the idea is to que beginners to use their hammies and ass with a neutral lower back</p>
