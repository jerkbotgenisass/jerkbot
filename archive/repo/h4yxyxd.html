<div class="md"><p>I started a lean bulk a week ago (first time attempting it). Im not sure if Im eating enough currently. How long should I track my weight/measurements before increasing my calorie intake (in the case that Im not eating enough and I plateau in my lifts).</p>

<div class="md"><p>Not sure what program you are following or whose advice you are taking, but a lean bulk is nigh impossible. Based on the phrasing of the comment I&#39;m assuming you are a beginner lifter.</p>

<p>Don&#39;t eat dirty, and eat as much as you can stomach.   Only advice I&#39;ll give. Don&#39;t track macros or calories. If u work out with a dedicated program, you aren&#39;t eating enough.  I guarantee it</p>

<div class="md"><p>Ummm no.  But considering the fact that every beginner lifter thinks he can get bigger and maintain the same body fat % I&#39;d assume I&#39;m right. But hey maybe a lean bulk is possible for some people</p>

<div class="md"><p>Again, you have no information about OP other than that he&#39;s trying to slow bulk(which works given time and proper programming) and needs to figure out timeline before increasing calories. Not sure how do you think your answer helped with OP&#39;s question.</p>

<div class="md"><p>Think he said lean bulk and NOT slow bulk.  That would be a key difference in ur interpretation versus mine.  Just trying to point out that lean bulk doesn&#39;t exist save SARM</p>
