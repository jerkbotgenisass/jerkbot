<div class="md"><p>People seem to forget (or more likely ignore) the fact that slave owners literally bred their slaves to make bigger stronger slaves. You ever wonder why black men absolutely DOMINATE the majority of professional sports in the US? Yeah, it&#39;s not an accident. It&#39;s the remnants of eugenics playing out in real time. Genetics play a HUGE role in physical development, and for a very long time only the strongest survived while being paired with their equivalent for breeding purposes.</p>

<p>I&#39;m not a supporter of eugenics but the end result can be seen, ironically, in those many have deemed as being &quot;genetically inferior.&quot; It&#39;s ALMOST funny.</p>
