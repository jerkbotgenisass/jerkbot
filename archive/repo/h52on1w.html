<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Hey I&#39;m starting a new job as a warehouse picker next week, it&#39;ll be including lots of heavy lifting and being on my feet 12hrs a day, 3 days a week. If I was to follow a strict diet of chicken, rice, Broccoli etc, would I be able to gain any noticeable muscle mass?</p>

<p>I&#39;m also considering going to the gym twice a week as I&#39;ll have 4 days off, but I want to settle in my new job first.</p>

<p>I&#39;m 21, 6&#39;1, weigh around 75kg if that helps, any input/advice is appreciated, thanks!</p>

<p>Edit: thanks again to all the replies, I&#39;ll read up on the FAQ and do more research on my diet as you guys pointed out. Cheers!</p>

<div class="md"><p>FWIW</p>

<p>I was in a similar position:</p>

<p>-hard gainer</p>

<p>-late 20’s</p>

<p>-physically demanding job </p>

<p>-lifted heavy 5 days a week before work</p>

<p>-paid meal prep in excess of 4,500 kcal/day</p>

<p>I looked very fit and the muscles showed but I absolutely could not get “bigger”</p>

<p>I’m now working a sedentary job and eating much less but seeing noticeable growth.</p>

<p>(I was not eating your diet, meals were intentionally MUCH more calorically dense)</p>

<p>Your metabolism, daily caloric burn, and caloric intake and density are the important variables in your equation.</p>

<p>In my case, I was eating a LOT of VERY dense foods (beef stews etc) but I still burned it all.</p>

<div class="md"><p>Well it’s pretty simple. You just would have needed to eat more.<br/>
Also there are no Hard gainers. Somatotypes are pseudo science</p>

<div class="md"><p>Hard gainers are real, they just aren&#39;t a biological phenomenon. Like some people find it hard to gain weight, same way people find it hard to lose it.   </p>

<p>Tends to just come down to shitty habits and a incomplete knowledge base.</p>

<div class="md"><p>You should stop spreading misinformation.  Somatypes are thoroughly researched by multiple leading university teams across the planet.</p>
