<div class="md"><p>What can I do one month out from a vacation to most effectively look more shredded? I&#39;m 12-14% body fat at 6&#39;2, 195lbs. I&#39;ll lose a pound a week from here via caloric deficit, and am decreasing fat/carbs and increasing protein.</p>

<p>Am I understanding correctly that bodybuilders gradually decrease sodium / carb intake and increase protein as competitions get closer?</p>

<p>I&#39;m also going to play more basketball than usual and do occasional HIIT (and lift 5x / week of course). Just going to drink a ton of water and stretch to cope with having fewer calories and higher cardio than normal. </p>

<p>Any other suggestions or comments?</p>
