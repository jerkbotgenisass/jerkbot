Insane diarrhea on keto?

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I had been doing keto for 2 months.  SW was 143, got down to 133 during those two months with a less strict weekend every now and then.  I&#39;m 30F and 5 foot 2 and have always had issues with snacking/portion control so I was loving how keto controlled my cravings and was generally really satisfied with all the food I was eating on the diet.  My goal weight was to get down to around 116.</p>

<p>I was eating pretty healthily - incorporating a good amount of veg (typically romaine, mixed greens, spinach, bell peppers, and cooked cauliflower every once in awhile) with protein (eating a lot of fat trimmed pork loin, chicken breast, deli meat, bacon, occasional sausages) and cooking all my meals at home and weighing and measuring everything.  I know my body fat percentage is high so I was not trying to add extra fat.</p>

<p>I was, however, having insane uncontrollable diarrhea - apologies in advance, but it was like pressurized water coming out the rear and sometimes it would feel pretty urgent.  Luckily I&#39;ve mostly been working from home so I never had any accidents.</p>

<p>I have IBS and GERD, so I&#39;m pretty used to some level of discomfort and was having trouble telling if it was related to my IBS, or maybe to my caffeine consumption (I reintroduced coffee to my diet a month into keto since I was feeling good and my GERD symptoms were completely gone, but I stopped drinking it after a week).  I noticed that the diarrhea is definitely worse when I have caffeine, but even without it I still had a couple bouts of it a day without fail.</p>

<p>Then this weekend, I had to travel for a bachelorette and knew I needed carbs to be able to drink without getting crazy hangovers.  I&#39;ve been off keto for 6 days now, and I haven&#39;t had diarrhea once, which suggests it&#39;s the diet itself.</p>

<p>I&#39;m super confused because I was making sure to keep on top of my electrolytes - I drank 3-4 packs of LMNT throughout the day each day (typically splitting half between a flavored pack and half using the no flavored packs) while on keto and also drank a minimum of 120 oz of water each day and tried to prioritize foods high in potassium and magnesium (ate a lot of spinach and avocados).  I was eating around 900-1200 calories a day, staying consistently under 20 net carbs, and prioritizing protein.</p>

<p>Has anyone had a similar experience or any advice as to what they think the cause could be?  I don&#39;t eat any keto cheat foods so outside of the LMNT, I never had any sugar replacements, which I know can cause diarrhea.  I&#39;m pretty bummed because I really want to get back on the diet and was loving the progress and how it made me feel but I am so tired of the nonstop diarrhea.</p>
