<div class="md"><p>Reality. Any normal person that wants to be in better shape does not need to go to extremes. Period.   </p>

<p>What&#39;s the difference between &quot;recompositioning&quot; and &quot;cutting&quot; beyond 250 calories? Nothing.</p>

<div class="md"><p>&quot;cutting&quot; or &quot;bulking&quot; is typically defined as a 500 (up to 1000) calorie deficit or surplus. That leads unsustainable eating patterns.   </p>

<p>A small deficit or surplus (250-500) (a la recomposition) by comparison enforces a more stable eating pattern because it&#39;s close to what you&#39;d theoretically need to eat to maintain.  </p>

<p>There&#39;s really no difference beyond calorie counts. There&#39;s really no such thing as a magic bulking workout or magic cutting workout beyond strategies to burn more or less calories.  </p>

<p>Cutting and bulking at this point has just become marketing speak as far as I care. Anyone looking to get into better shape is technically recompositioning.  The massive deficit/surplus is best left to someone who&#39;s made a career/pro hobby out of it.</p>

<div class="md"><p>500-1000kcal surplus or deficit is 1-2lbs per week, that&#39;s absolutely sustainable for the majority of people.</p>

<p>Your definition for body recomposition gives lots of grey area, like why is a 499kcal deficit good and ok because it&#39;s body recomposition but a 501kcal deficit is too far and unsustainable because it&#39;s a cut. </p>

<p>And yes there are definitely differences between programs so that you can or can&#39;t run them on a cut. You don&#39;t recover as well in a caloric deficit so have to manage intensity much more closely, conversely in a surplus you can handle more volume/intensity and so can progress faster. For example  running Building the Monolith on a caloric deficit is simply asking to be ran into the ground. </p>

<p>Maybe it&#39;s just in the content you consume that it&#39;s become marketing speak but using bulking and cutting methods absolutely has a place for anyone invested in fitness and lifting
It&#39;s effective, it works, why restrict yourself to deficits/surpluses that are small enough to be lost in the noise because &#39;cutting and bulking is for pro bodybuilders&#39;</p>

<div class="md"><p>2lbs a week is not sustainable in the long term. I&#39;m sorry, I disagree. 1,000kcal defecit is enormous. It&#39;s marketing that has people hyped that 2lbs a week is sustainable.  </p>

<p>That&#39;s the addition or removal of like 5 chicken thighs per day.   </p>

<p>Slower is better, and ultimately results in having a faster net change because you&#39;re not playing games ping ponging your weight back and forth.   </p>

<p>Normal people (the majority) do not need to go to extremes to get in better shape. They just don&#39;t. The fitness community makes a fortune by people fucking up.</p>

<div class="md"><p>It&#39;s sustainable for the 8-12 week period that cuts are recommended for, followed by a period of maintenance or a bulk and then you can cut again. It&#39;s nowhere near as extreme as you try and make it to be. </p>

<p>I&#39;m not trying to argue bulking and cutting is always the best option. If you can&#39;t handle it then that&#39;s fine, continue your slow recomp, but making sweeping statements like &#39;slower is better&#39; is ridiculous especially on a subreddit populated by people who are dedicated to fitness.</p>

<p>It&#39;s effective, there&#39;s a reason why the most successful members of the community use these tools.</p>

<div class="md"><p>Most of the people here are normies, no matter how hard they boast. The fact that a cut is only recommended for 8-12 weeks pretty much furthers my point: Literally no one is achieving their ideal body in three short months or everyone would already be fit.   </p>

<p>So no, I don&#39;t think my claim is ridiculous at all. Transforming your body takes quite literally years. The biggest guys in the gym have typically been doing it all of their lives.  The fastest guys on the track have been running all their lives. The best basketball players have been playing basketball all their lives.   </p>

<p>Radically changing your diet for a short three month stint is not sustainable because it does not reinforce long term healthy eating habits. It&#39;s really that simple.   </p>

<p>We&#39;re both trying to argue in favor of health, which is fine, but I implore you to take the &quot;long view&quot;. The best shape of my life came when I stopped listening to the knuckleheads on bodybuilding .com. Slow and steady wins the race. We can agree to disagree on that point if you like.</p>
