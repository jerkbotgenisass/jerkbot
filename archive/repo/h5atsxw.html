<div class="md"><p>We have recently spoken with Reddit Admins and have to bring a few issues to light. Firstly, I want to say I am personally guilty of this, and I take ownership of that. Effective today: </p>

<p><strong>We cannot continue posting screenshots without blurring usernames - no exceptions.</strong></p>

<p><strong>We cannot continue mentioning usernames  of &quot;Apes&quot; within our comments - no exceptions.</strong></p>

<p><strong>We cannot continue directly linking to threads in other subreddits - no exceptions. This includes cross-posting.</strong></p>

<p>These rules are effective immediately and will be enforced, again - without exceptions. Obviously there will be some newer posts by people who haven&#39;t read this. We will try to be understanding, but obvious ignoring of these new rules will result in a permanent ban from this subreddit.</p>

<p>I know, other subs brigade and do the same to us. But it&#39;s time for us to be the bigger hedgies. Discussions are fine, blurred screenshots are fine, mocking ape mentality is still fine. But we can&#39;t allow anymore posts/comments that make it easier to harass or encourage harassment of other Redditors - no matter how much fun it can be. </p>

<p>Please do not post on these Ape subs with the intention of eliciting reactions, and especially do not post screenshots of yourself doing so, <em>even if the other posters usernames are blurred</em>. </p>

<p>We can still make fun of bagholders, we just can&#39;t be specific about who we&#39;re mocking anymore, and we can&#39;t post links that will allow further harassment to continue.</p>

<p><strong>Basically, let&#39;s keep our hands to ourselves.</strong></p>

<p>I apologize if my posts and comments have encouraged anyone else to do this. It&#39;s not acceptable, and I will do my part to ensure this sub follows all Reddit TOS from here on out.</p>
