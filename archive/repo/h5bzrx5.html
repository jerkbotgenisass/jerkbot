<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I eat ground beef (80/20) almost everyday exclusively. I eat two pounds in the morning and 2 pounds in the evening. I am almost at week 4 of this WOE and I still get a diarrhea episode after meal 1. Meal 2 doesn&#39;t bother me as much if at all.</p>

<p>I chalked that up to drinking the rendered fat which also made me feel bloated and nauseous, so I ceased this behavior. I then ate it cold with improvement but then in an around 1 - 2hrs I had the same diarrhea episode again.</p>

<p>Yes, I do drink water before and after my meal which I plan to cut out, however I do know that rendered fat for me is an issue.</p>

<p>If I strain the ground beef I will lose some fat content. Would you make up for the lost fat with other fats? Would you throw them in the same meal or eat these fats at a later time?</p>

<p>Basically what should I do to prevent this diarrhea episode from happening but still take in the same fat and protein content daily?</p>

<div class="md"><p>How long have you been doing this? I eat almost exclusively 73-27 ground beef most days and it took me about six to eight weeks to stop the diarrhea. I strain mine and sometimes add cheese for additional fats but have to be careful not to add too much fat back in or I get another fun squatting on the Reddit throne session.</p>
