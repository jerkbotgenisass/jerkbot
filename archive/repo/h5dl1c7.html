<div class="md"><p>If you believe that round back lifting is inherently dangerous then maybe. But given that Atlas stones are a regular lift for strongman I don&#39;t really think so.</p>

<p>I know my face says different but this was relatively conservative weight. Biggest risk factor I see in this lift is the eccentric because to get past your knees you have to shift the center of gravity away from your body making this the hardest part.</p>

<p>If I do these again then I&#39;ll probably just rack them or put them down like a regular Zercher instead.</p>

<div class="md"><p>I should have been more specific!</p>

<p>Strong men injure themselves at far higher rates doing the lifts they do then athletes in other lifting sports.</p>

<p>You do you man, I&#39;m not judging. </p>

<p>I&#39;m just saying &#39;strongmen do it&#39; doesn&#39;t mean you aren&#39;t going to fuck up your back.</p>

<p>My issue isn&#39;t with your lift, it&#39;s with your rationale on why you think it&#39;ll be OK for you.</p>
