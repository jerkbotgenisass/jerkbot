<div class="md"><p>My goal for the year was to join the 1/2/3/4 plate club. (1 plate ohp, 2 plate bench, 3 plate squat, 4 plate deadlift)</p>

<p>Recently did OHP and hit 2 plate bench last week, and 3 plate squat today. Deadlift Iâ€™m coming for you!</p>

<div class="md"><p>If you&#39;ve been lifting consistently for years and can&#39;t do a 3 plate squat yet then you really need to change your program. </p>

<p>Unless of course you have hip/leg/back issues that prevent heavy squats</p>

<div class="md"><p>That depends on the individual&#39;s starting strength, but squatting 140kg should be doable for most adult/teenage men following a program within a year at most, if not half a year or sooner for some.</p>

<div class="md"><p>This is simply not true and lacks nuances. For some it will be very doable, for others it can take years.
It really depends on a lot to factors such as your gender, your weight and height, if you previously did sports and your general activity levels, your age, how much you can train, your recovery, your diet etc.</p>

<p>I have changed my comment, as this is a good point, and intended within my original statement.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>height</p>
</blockquote>

<p>While leverages certainly change the difficulty level of lifts, it&#39;s not the be-all and end-all, and I&#39;ve seen many 190cm+- guys squatting close to 200 at my local gym.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t, however, think weight, recovery, general activity and diet are any arguments. Yes, they play a factor, but they can be easily modulated.</p>

<p>To rephrase (now I know why so many warning labels are hyperdetailed):</p>

<p>I think most teenage to adult males with no severe physical ailments, that are not more than 200 centimeters in height will be able to squat over 3 plates within half a year, if not a full year, provided they eat well and use a sensible strength training program.</p>

<div class="md"><p>Those numbers are very achievable at the end, or even during a linear progression program.</p>

<p>There&#39;s some in the wiki if you&#39;re interested in getting started with lifting, you might surprise yourself!</p>
