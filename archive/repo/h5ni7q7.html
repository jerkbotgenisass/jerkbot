<div class="md"><p>Whenever someone asks my opinion about fitness, I tell them to just start doing something. I am of the opinion that something is better than nothing. People over contemplate the whole idea of the perfect diet, whereas in my opinion it should be a life style change as the first step. Where you increase your daily activity and then just worry about your diet along this journey. Writing all this because my sister recently asked for my guidance and she was too focused on buying the perfect food, instead of figuring out the exercise routine.</p>
