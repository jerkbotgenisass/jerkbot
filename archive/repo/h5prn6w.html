Caught a cold for the second time this year. Is it the diet or am I doing something else wrong?

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>So, a bit of context my roommates both caught some nasty cold/flu and for the last two weeks have gradually descended into hacking phlegm morning until night. They also don&#39;t take particularly good care of themselves. They certainly do not eat carnivore and almost all meals are accompanied by some sugar of sorts if not entirely so. </p>

<p>I have been feeling great eating 4lbs ground beef everyday, sometimes with cheese, BP coffee&#39;s minus the coconut oil, and on occasion I will indulge in Greek yoghurt. Those of you who have seen my posts in the recent weeks will notice that I have been having some diarrhea issues but these were fixed the moment I began straining my ground beef. Turns out the rendered fat is just no good for my gut which has problems to begin with.</p>

<p>As for supplementation I consume omega 3&#39;s, vit D with vit K, and a multivitamin everyday. I accompany that with vitamin C. All this because I do have a rigorous training schedule. Sleep is decent I assume because I wake up with a fair amount of energy. I am consistent with my sodium intake so I don&#39;t believe that to be an issue.</p>

<p>Here is my issue:</p>

<p>I have now caught their cold. I don&#39;t feel as bad and I am not coughing as bad, but today I feel run down and had to take a break from training. I train 7 days a week which totals to around 15hrs. 4 sessions of lifting weights and the rest is martial arts: grappling and striking.</p>

<p>Three of those days are double sessions though. The martial arts is cardio intensive and the weight lifting routine is a push pull schedule.</p>

<p>I have been training like this for a year and this is the second time I am sick in 2021.</p>

<p>Is there something I should be adding to my diet? A supplement? Could it be that I just got unlucky living with two sickly guys who passed it on to me? Should I take a day off sometime? Any advice in general?</p>

<div class="md"><p>Might you be overtraining?</p>

<p>&quot;Overtraining syndrome (OTS) occurs where an athlete is training vigorously, yet performance deteriorates. One sign of OTS is suppressed immune function, with an increased incidence of upper respiratory tract infection (URTI). An increased incidence of URTIs is also associated with high volume/intensity training.&quot;</p>

<p><a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/12696983/#:%7E:text=Overtraining%20syndrome%20(OTS)%20occurs%20where,respiratory%20tract%20infection%20(URTI)">https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/12696983/#:~:text=Overtraining%20syndrome%20(OTS)%20occurs%20where,respiratory%20tract%20infection%20(URTI)</a>.</p>

<p>Can you make space to have one or two days off where you just walk in the park? Or are you training for an upcoming competition?</p>

<p>Also, maybe eat a few eggs everyday as a &quot;supplement&quot;. They&#39;ve got some nutrients you don&#39;t typically get in meat (unless you&#39;re eating liver regularly) like choline and fat-soluble vitamins. Multivitamins won&#39;t help IMO because they&#39;re nowhere near as bioavailable as real food.</p>
