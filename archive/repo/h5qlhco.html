<div class="md"><p>Not that I think he is 70 anyway but he is at least on testosterone replacement therapy.And he doesn&#39;t work out everyday, that would be detrimental to building muscle. Why is it always &quot;every single day&quot; with these journalists as soon as they make a story on somebody impressive?  </p>

<p><strong>EDIT:</strong> Yes you can of course work out every day smart asses. You can go on a bike for 10 minutes every day or do 1 pushup every day. Obviously I meant if you want to build muscle you don&#39;t lift weights every day <em>especially</em> if you are older. Recovery is one of the most important parts of building muscle and overtraining is very real. And yes you can also take steroids to speed up recovery. Taking 0 days off is still a bad idea.</p>
