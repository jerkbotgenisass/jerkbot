Why is a carnivore diet helping me?

<div class="post">
<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I&#39;ve had some problems with negative mood for a long time, manifesting especially in anxiety mainly of a physiological kind (fight or flight/chest tightness) around social situations. This has caused me to be a bit timid and nervous generally, resulting in a lot of fear that I won&#39;t be able to accomplish the things I want to do in life.</p>

<p>I recently did an experiment with a carnivore diet and all of this is just gone. I can feel a very clear physical difference in how I react to things - there is much less, if any, of that chest tightness; talking feels a lot easier; and I have a generally much more positive attitude toward life and am not crippled by the same sense of insecurity, precariousness, and incompetence - instead I am starting to feel powerful and confident.</p>

<p>Clearly, then, I think something was wrong with how I was eating before. But this diet is a hassle, so if possible, it would be nice to identify the particular issue my previous diets were causing, so I can avoid whatever food might have been the problem without being constrained to animal products alone (especially the cheap meat I&#39;d probably end up eating to keep it sustainable cost-wise - not the most fun). I&#39;ve tried a lot of different diets before, but my intake was overall pretty &quot;balanced,&quot; at least for Americans (so I wasn&#39;t binging on garbage).</p>

<p>Does anyone have a sense of what this diet actually does to improve mental health? There are a few theories I have: maybe all the cholesterol and saturated fat raise testosterone. Maybe there is something bad going on with PUFAs from vegetable oil. Maybe carbs themselves cause issues like inflammation that filter through to the mind (I don&#39;t think it&#39;s a Celiac thing because I had a test that came back negative).</p>

<p>It would be nice if I could find an easy takeaway like &quot;your issues were caused by vegetable oil so eat anything except that.&quot; Does anyone have any ideas?</p>

<div class="md"><p>What did your diet consist of before switching to a meat-only diet? Did it include sugar, processed foods, and lots of high GI carbohydrates?</p>

<div class="md"><p>Actually I can be pretty lazy about food so before this it was basically all Huel, which iirc has a very <a href="https://huel.com/pages/what-is-glycemic-index-and-load">low glycemic index</a>. That&#39;s why I was wondering if it had something to do with cholesterol or seed oils. Huel has 0 cholesterol, so maybe I wasn&#39;t getting enough for T levels? Alternatively, it has <a href="https://huel.com/pages/the-huel-powder-formula-explained#fats">sunflower oil</a> which maybe didn&#39;t agree with me?</p>

<div class="md"><p>Yes sorry, I meant over the course of my life I&#39;ve tried lots of different diets. The most recent period was almost all Huel. I edited the post to clarify that</p>

<p>But I guess now that I think about it, before Huel I was mostly eating random stuff with little rhyme or reason, so probably pretty high GI overall.</p>

<div class="md"><p>All huel is probably the worst possible diet a human being could have lmao. Go eat fruits and vegetables, meat and fish, and supplement that with some carbohydrates of your choosing, healthy fats (olive oil, coconut oil, butter, ghee) and see how you feel then.</p>

<p>Out of interest why do you say this? While I&#39;d expect there to definitely be healthier diets, I think I&#39;d expect huel to fairly handily outperform typical western diets high in junk/fast food etc.</p>

<div class="md"><p>You know what, I looked into huel and considering how garbage a standard western diet is, probably huel beats it. It is not as terrible as I thought (oats, fatty acid profile, some fruit powders), but actual food has vastly better nutritient absorption rates, phytochemical benefits and higher satiety. </p>

<p>Biggest pitfalls probably come from the lack of fresh plants, lack of chewing and isolated minerals/vitamins that are just not well absorbed at all.</p>

<p>But that being said, I would love to see some actual research of all huel diets vs SAD and Mediterranean, in terms of health, longevity, disease rates etc. Very exciting stuff for sure. But if you are using it as intended, to replace a meal, probably its not bad :)</p>

<div class="md"><p><a href="https://drcate.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/good-fats-and-bad-post-Dr-Cate-jan-2019.jpeg">Sunflower oil</a> is definitely on the list of oils I would never touch. But in the case of Huel it also contains oats, rice, pea protein, etc which some people react to.</p>
