<p>Hard work and TRT often go hand in hand. I got on TRT when I turned 40 precisely because I love working hard in the gym and was finding that my low testosterone made it harder for me to keep doing it.</p>

<div class="md"><p>Right. But in order to get TRT you need to be diagnosed with low T. </p>

<p>Not everyone has low T. It’s not a blanket “effects everyone equally” condition. Yes, testosterone levels drop off as you age, but we are all decidedly not created equal. </p>

<p>If you have low T, fine. Get it treated. if you don’t, then don’t. But far too often these fitness subs just say, “well TRT is just legal steroids and it doesn’t matter what your levels are you can just get it after 40”</p>

<div class="md"><p>I&#39;m 40 and never touched TRT and can still put on muscle bulk, even in short term routines. This dude&#39;s before and after pics span 2 years. I have a hypothesis that people who reflexively cry &quot;TRT&quot; at any buff dude over 40 probably knows Jack shit about how to lift effectively.</p>

<div class="md"><p>No one cried. Did you saw his shoulder development in two years? Cmon, give me a break. Maybe it’s the photo, lighting or how is positioned, but TRT would easily be the first guess, especially to someone saying “it’s more hard work” and other bullshit.
Don’t be retarded.</p>

<div class="md"><p>The amount of 20 year old somethings who don’t have the first clue about fitness who claim “TRT!” Every time some old guy puts them to shame is just another day on Reddit. It’s sad. These gains are pretty average for two years of lifting. It takes real dedication to run a half marathon and get this far in two years of lifting, I’m not knocking it. But these are exactly the results you get from consistent effort, good diet, and smart training. This guy trains like an athlete and it shows. </p>

<p>That 70 year old woman who made the rounds on social media last is what you would expect from 2 years of TRT  with regular lifting.</p>

<div class="md"><p>Facts. These dumbasses tell on themselves every time they raise the &quot;TRT&quot; flag. Nah, brah, you just have never had the discipline to do the work and dieting.</p>
