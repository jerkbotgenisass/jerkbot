<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I am a 34 year old guy blessed with a very Napoleonic stature of 5&quot;1. Shout out to my fellow shortys.</p>

<p>Anywho, I am really struggling to escape the skinny fat vortex and thought i&#39;d post here to see if i&#39;m missing something??</p>

<p>Been working out on and off for about 5 years but became a bit of a slob during the months of the UK lockdown and experienced a hard break-up which didn&#39;t help eating and drinking habits. Happy days. So, I decided to get my shit together. Since Nov 2020 i&#39;ve been doing bodyweight/free weight routines consistently, tracking calories and weighing myself weekly.</p>

<p>I&#39;m a small guy and fairly slight but always had lots of fat around my stomach and &#39;love handles&#39;. Just winning that genetic lottery all the way. Did a cut first based on working out my TDEE and settled on 1900 cals with around 90g protein (I was 8st 3 or 115 pounds when I started cut).</p>

<p>During the 12 week cut I made real progress on my belly and side fat, got some modest lean muscle and my back got shredded. Also had the noticeable veins in my arms which I&#39;d always wanted. BUT, overall I was losing weight, my trousers were falling off me, neck seemed to get skinnier. It seemed the price to pay for losing the belly fat was getting more &#39;petite?!&#39;</p>

<p>Now, I wanted to start packing on some lean muscle and in June 2021 I decided to embark on Tom Merrick&#39;s (Bodyweight Warrior YouTube) progressive, bodyweight routine for mass. <a href="https://static1.squarespace.com/static/57e50bc4d1758e426f43ec5d/t/5ada0951f950b799c203cf0c/1561539492490/The+Bodyweight+Warrior+eBook+V3.pdf">https://static1.squarespace.com/static/57e50bc4d1758e426f43ec5d/t/5ada0951f950b799c203cf0c/1561539492490/The+Bodyweight+Warrior+eBook+V3.pdf</a></p>

<p>So I decided to up my calories to around 2200 a day. 5 weeks in and the belly fat has returned. I feel like I can&#39;t win!?</p>

<p>For info: I do at least 10,000 steps a day and on top of my hour long full body split sessions three times a week I try and squeeze two good HIIT sessions in for fat loss.</p>

<p><strong>TLDR: Skinny fat guy here, when I cut I get lean but lose weight seem to get smaller overall, when I go on a slight calorie increase the belly fat returns. I can&#39;t win, halp.</strong></p>

<p>Edit: Date started new routine</p>

<div class="md"><p>If you are gaining fat instead of muscle mass you are either not working out enough or eating to much. Or both. If you lose fat yes you will look smaller. Many &quot;big guys&quot; are mostly fat. Look at linus from linus tech tips. The guy looks really small but has muscles and is fit. I think its more a mental thing for you, already being smaller posture, to accept youll be smaller while being fitter. Its not the size that matters but what it consists out of. Once you are fit you can start working out more and adding some protein.</p>
