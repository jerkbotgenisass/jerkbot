<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I am a 34 year old guy blessed with a very Napoleonic stature of 5&quot;1. Shout out to my fellow shortys.</p>

<p>Anywho, I am really struggling to escape the skinny fat vortex and thought i&#39;d post here to see if i&#39;m missing something??</p>

<p>Been working out on and off for about 5 years but became a bit of a slob during the months of the UK lockdown and experienced a hard break-up which didn&#39;t help eating and drinking habits. Happy days. So, I decided to get my shit together. Since Nov 2020 i&#39;ve been doing bodyweight/free weight routines consistently, tracking calories and weighing myself weekly.</p>

<p>I&#39;m a small guy and fairly slight but always had lots of fat around my stomach and &#39;love handles&#39;. Just winning that genetic lottery all the way. Did a cut first based on working out my TDEE and settled on 1900 cals with around 90g protein (I was 8st 3 or 115 pounds when I started cut).</p>

<p>During the 12 week cut I made real progress on my belly and side fat, got some modest lean muscle and my back got shredded. Also had the noticeable veins in my arms which I&#39;d always wanted. BUT, overall I was losing weight, my trousers were falling off me, neck seemed to get skinnier. It seemed the price to pay for losing the belly fat was getting more &#39;petite?!&#39;</p>

<p>Now, I wanted to start packing on some lean muscle and in June 2021 I decided to embark on Tom Merrick&#39;s (Bodyweight Warrior YouTube) progressive, bodyweight routine for mass. <a href="https://static1.squarespace.com/static/57e50bc4d1758e426f43ec5d/t/5ada0951f950b799c203cf0c/1561539492490/The+Bodyweight+Warrior+eBook+V3.pdf">https://static1.squarespace.com/static/57e50bc4d1758e426f43ec5d/t/5ada0951f950b799c203cf0c/1561539492490/The+Bodyweight+Warrior+eBook+V3.pdf</a></p>

<p>So I decided to up my calories to around 2200 a day. 5 weeks in and the belly fat has returned. I feel like I can&#39;t win!?</p>

<p>For info: I do at least 10,000 steps a day and on top of my hour long full body split sessions three times a week I try and squeeze two good HIIT sessions in for fat loss.</p>

<p><strong>TLDR: Skinny fat guy here, when I cut I get lean but lose weight seem to get smaller overall, when I go on a slight calorie increase the belly fat returns. I can&#39;t win, halp.</strong></p>

<p>Edit: Date started new routine</p>

<div class="md"><p>Any proof of that? Anytime I see him I see a skinny guy without any muscle.</p>

<p>Jeff Cavaliere is a guy I consider Fit but not Buff, whatever he has his shirt on he looks like an average guy.</p>

<p>Buff for me would be Buff Dudes/Jeff Nippard, any clothes they put on you can immediately see they are packing.</p>

<div class="md"><p>You&#39;re looking at bodies through the lens of fitness influencers/fitness freaks.</p>

<p>Linus is &quot;normal person fit&quot;. He&#39;s got low body-fat %, visible abs, and general muscle tone over his body. Due to this he looks skinny and &quot;normal&quot; in clothes, because fit doesn&#39;t mean &quot;big&quot;. He is in much better shape than the avg person, probably better shape than the avg person on this subreddit too.</p>

<p>Jeff Cavaliere is a fitness model . . . he&#39;d look small next to a Strongman, some athletes, and bodybuilder competitors, but he <em>is</em> a buff fitness freak that puts 99% of other &quot;fitness freaks&quot; to shame.</p>
