<div class="md"><p>Okay, this is just going to devolve into semantics then because ignoring this extreme analogy, I’d personally argue that 1 action is less work in a way due to being completed faster. I judge work based on time, quantity, and quality - and time to me is one of the most valuable resources when it comes to doing any work, that’s one that I personally want to spend the least of. When you factor everything including time spent and his target physique, this is more work, if you compare the actions 1:1 then obviously this is easier and I’m sure he has way more in his routine than just pull-ups.</p>

<p>10 lbs 10 times is not going to ever give the same physique as 150 lbs one time, it’s just not a realistic comparison when you take so many other real world factors into account.</p>

<div class="md"><p>That would be true for this particular exercise but I don’t know how realistic that would be to pull off. That would be a significant amount of weight to match what legs would be and could present problematic stress to areas that aren’t meant to bear that kind of load leading to an injury, but that’s a different issue.

<p>His entire torso is available. How do you think military can hold 200lbs backpacks on them? It&#39;s distributed on their shoulders and around their torso. If you&#39;re strong enough, this isn&#39;t extra stress and you can do just about everything normally with that. 200lbs is about what I put on my body for dips, just around my waist, and there&#39;s no issue because I built up to it. 200lbs is far more than the average set of legs. </p>

<div class="md"><p>Arguing to argue, dude you literally came in here and tried to make this a one-dimensional argument. Are you intentionally trying to misread things or do you struggle with basic context? The spine example was an example of area everyone clearly knows you shouldn’t put direct weight on. When did soldiers running around come into this?? That weight is balanced by legs and that’s not good for anyone long term just because it can be done. I never even said it was impossible for him to pull up weights but it’s not as clean and dry as it would be for us. Seriously you want to claim that I’m here to argue just to argue and you’re over here huffing and puffing “You’re wrong!! You’re wrong!!” When I never said it was impossible for him.

<div class="md"><p>Nope, this is easily disproved by the fact that those other factors subjectively carry different values to different people such as time etc. however as living beings our time is much more limited than an individual effort than we put out.

<div class="md"><p>If you want to go full circle, then we&#39;re talking about effort put in vs results gained. Frankly, his situation would not make results come any slower so long as he programmed it well. Time spent on an individual exercise doesn&#39;t matter, only time spent at the gym does. This is because if you only take 10s to work out but have to do 5 sets with 5 minute breaks in between, shaving 20 seconds off of each set doesn&#39;t make effective time at the gym any different. Again, this should feel obvious to anyone who actually does resistance training...which you claim, but doesn&#39;t seem to be the case by how to talk about any of this.</p>

<p>But if it&#39;s easily disproven....disprove it; find me any definition of work that doesn&#39;t include forces and displacement. I&#39;m waiting.</p>

<div class="md"><p>You showed up to a random thread just like I did. The only reason I brought up my workouts is because they&#39;re relevant...dips and pullups don&#39;t use legs.

<div class="md"><p>No expert, but I think it gets important to have resistance. Reps vs higher weights have different outcomes in training - 1x 100kg does not equal 10x 10kg. So idk if the work is more or less, but I don&#39;t think it&#39;s as simple as &quot;work is exactly the same, just more reps&quot;.</p>

<div class="md"><p>I did over simplify it. But for the most part muscles need to be broken down a certain amount in order to build muscle. Which means 2 people would need to do the same &quot;work&quot; to get the same muscle. The method typically affects whether you have usable muscle or just show muscles.</p>

<div class="md"><p>Yeah, I think that’s technically true but it would take a significant amount of weight to match what legs would be and that could lead to an injury putting that much weight on areas of the body not meant to bare that weight like joints. The potential injury is a separate issue but I think it’s something to consider.</p>
