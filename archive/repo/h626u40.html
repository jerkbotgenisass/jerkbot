Normal deadlift vs hex bar deadlift?

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Hey fellas, been a lurker around here for a while had a question about deadlifting. </p>

<p>I almost always use the hex bar for deadlifting. For me, it feels much more natural and less of a strain on my back. Am I missing out on crucial muscle groups by not doing traditional deadlift or is it a reasonable substitute?</p>

<div class="md"><p>How long did you use low handles? It would be interesting to know.</p>

<p>Years ago I got to a 230kg while only doing it with a bar less than handful of times by using the trap bar. My squat was only 155kg at the time, so that didn&#39;t contribute much. </p>

<p>However, that is going from novice to having a not awful  deadlift. I  don&#39;t know anyone with a strong deadlift who then switched to trap bar for a period and then went back.</p>
