<div class="md"><p>Nah she is confident in what she lifts and knows her limits. When you know what you are capable of you don’t need any assistance.</p>

<div class="md"><p>Ok can you explain why. Not being an ash hole I just want your opinion. She can safely squat 350-375 with a spot so if she is confident lifting 295 without a spotter why is that bad?</p>

<div class="md"><p>What’s she going to do if her knee gives out and the weights crash on her? The bars don’t guarantee that she will be safe in an emergency. </p>

<p>I could list off more emergencies. She is living with her back as she raises up and locks her knees, if she knew what she was doing she would not try to lift those weights with her back. She full bends at the hip and extends for half of her lift. Her form is wobbling as she goes up and down, and she’s bouncing the weights at her apex. You don’t do any of that in lifting unless you don’t care about injury and just want to show off for the sake of showing off.</p>

<div class="md"><p>Those safety bars are better than a spotter any day and set at the right height to get you out. She is a college degree trainer with ten years of coaching experience. And she qualified for Nationals in the light weight women’s strongman. So I’m pretty sure she is doing okay. What is your background in weight lifting?</p>

<div class="md"><p>About 50% of that lift was with her back, holy cow that’s bad form, I’m sure she’s strong and I’m sure this isn’t her best rep, might just need another clip cause this is bad form. Also, your inability to take in constructive criticism is kinda anti “post stuff for the world to see and comment on” most in this post are offering good advice despite yours and her qualifications in regards to fitness</p>

<p>That said, gah dayum she strong!</p>
