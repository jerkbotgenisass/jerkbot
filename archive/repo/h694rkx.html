<div class="md"><p>The top comment with his work out “a lot” apparently does triathlons but I didn’t see any full length ones, just some shorter ones and no lifting credentials I could see either.  So, I’m going to guess skinny-fat runners body with terrible skin.</p>

<p>Sorry what? He submitted a 70.3 race report. Anything other than an Ironman is not a &quot;full length triathlon&quot; to you? There&#39;s still time to tell the Olympics they&#39;re about to make a big mistake!</p>

<p>yeah yeah tuchus i get it</p>

<div class="md"><p>He isn’t an Olympian though and as someone who does ironmans, yeah, I can judge what I consider to be “full length.”  My point wasn’t that it isn’t impressive though, which it is, it’s that adding another 8 hours to an endurance event is a whole other ballgame and I am doubtful he could do it neglecting carbs completely.  Shit doesn’t get any easier as you add more miles.</p>

<p>Edit: and post ass or shut up.</p>

<div class="md"><p>I thought keto and other high fat, low carb diets were good for endurance. I&#39;m not sure what the limit of it is though. Are you eating/refueling with carbs during the triathlons?</p>

<div class="md"><p>I eat right before I hit the water and I basically eat non-stop during the bike portion.  Most of what I am eating is carbs.  The lone exception is that for 5 of my 6 ironmans, I had a cheeseburger between bike and run because I was always starving and I don&#39;t like eating during the run itself.</p>

<p>I can&#39;t speak for many others out there because most of those days are a blur but quick digesting carbs and drinks like gatorade are staples for the majority of people I see on the longer ones.</p>

<p>I also think it&#39;s important to note that there may very well be people who could do an ironman without carbs.  Hell, I probably could do it on race day but I&#39;d certainly feel like shit.  The thing I contest was he wrote in a comment &quot;I improved my time by 6 minutes compared to my carb eating days.&quot;  If I only improved my time by 6 minutes in a race that long and I knew my training was on point, I would suspect my diet was the problem.  Maybe that&#39;s just the competitor in me but I improved by nearly 90 minutes between my first and second races.  My times are slower now but that is almost all entirely due to less training and a bum foot making me hobble for 26.2 miles.  And the dude doesn&#39;t seemingly lift, so he isn&#39;t even getting all the benefit out of his diet he could.</p>

<p>Just as you don&#39;t need to be an olympian to do olympic weightlifting, you don&#39;t need to be an olympian to do olympic triathlons.</p>

<p>There is no &quot;full length triathlon&quot;, that&#39;s just stupid. IRONMAN™ races may have done a lot for the popularity of the sport, but they certainly didnt invent it. There is also no &quot;full length foot race&quot; - there are races across any distance from 100m to 200+ miles. Just as there are triathlons from supersprint to ultraironman.</p>

<div class="md"><p>Sure, and do you run in them?  Because when I say full-length, I am clearly talking about full ironmans and that is a term that exists and is used by the people who actually compete in them.  Arguing otherwise tells me you are just looking for something to argue about without knowing what you are saying.</p>

<p>Or, are you just here to defend another random person on the internet who I never insulted beyond saying they likely have a skinny fat runners body, which I still stand by based on their post history.</p>

<p>Or, are you here because you do some length of endurance racing and it hurts your feelings I didn’t call your ravens full-length race.  I’m honestly confused why you even care but also care enough to keep being wrong.</p>

<p>That all being said, shut the fuck up you assless wanker.</p>
