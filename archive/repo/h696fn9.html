<div class="md"><p>Did you even read the ResearchGate article you linked?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>There is little if any research to indicate that locking out the knee or elbow will cause damage to normal joints with properly performed exercises. </p>

<p>In the normal, uninjured knee or elbow, full extension is the strongest weight-bearing position during axial loading.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The whole damn article basically says &quot;yeah, locking out joints is fine as long as you&#39;re not an idiot.&quot;</p>

<p>Not even going to open the bodybuilding.com article because that website is not a valid source.</p>

<p>I&#39;ll ask again, how much ya squat?</p>

<p>Yes, and in the context of the article it includes <em>a few specific examples</em> where locking out the joint may not be ideal, i.e. in injured athletes, in movements that are not axially loaded, and in certain very high volume contexts.</p>

<p>Tell me you don&#39;t know how to interpret science without telling me you don&#39;t know how to interpret science.</p>

<p>Literally the same source that you just linked because it explicitly says that full extension is totally safe in axially-loaded and properly performed exercises such as the squat/Bulgarian split squat. </p>

<blockquote>

<p>Need I remind you were the first one who questioned whether or not <a href="/u/BenchPolkov">u/BenchPolkov</a> squats?</p>

<p>Since you refuse to answer the question my assumption is that you don&#39;t squat.</p>

<div class="md"><p>I asked &quot;Do you even squat?&quot; Not &quot;How much do you squat?&quot; &quot;Bro&quot; and your assumptions are irrelevant. And not to mention I asked polkov not you.                                                                                    </p>

<p>&quot;IN AN EFFORT TO ADVISE THE
general public on the ‚Äúsafest‚Äù ways
to exercise, many professionals in
sports medicine advise individuals
not to lock out joints during resis-
tance training. Though there does
not seem to be much research
backing up the recommendation
not to lock out joints, <strong>there are
practical reasons for this recom-
mendation.</strong>&quot;</p>

<p>Why do I need to be a good interpreter just to read some simple English sentences...                                                              </p>

<p>And if you just wanna say it is safe if you know your shit then you are correct I do that as well for my 1rpm&#39;s </p>

<p>And if you interpreted that this whole source &quot;Explicitly said it is TOTALLY SAFE&quot; then I guess I don&#39;t need any advice on interpretation from you.                                                                  </p>

<p>I disagree.</p>

<p>So if he asked you how much (sorry, <em>if</em>) you squat, that would be okay?</p>

<p>I don&#39;t think you are a particularly good reader if you fail to realize that the article is literally saying it is safe to lock out joints <em>except in a few circumstances</em> which the article itself outlines. I don&#39;t know how you don&#39;t understand this. Further, nothing in the article negates the statements that there is no evidence that locking out joints in properly performed movements are inherently harmful to joint health. It provides that statement as an initial point of information that is important for readers to know, and <em>only then</em> does the article introduce <em>specific contexts</em> in which locking out the joint could <em>potentially</em> be harmful.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t know what you&#39;re getting at here.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>And if you interpreted that this whole source &quot;Explicitly said it is TOTALLY SAFE&quot; then I guess I don&#39;t need any advice on interpretation from you.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Fine, totally safe in axially-loaded, properly performed exercises where the athlete is not already injured. There, I specified it even more for you.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>&quot;DO NOT CORRECT A FOOL, OR HE WILL HATE YOU; CORRECT A WISE MAN, AND HE WILL APPRECIATE YOU.&quot;</p>
