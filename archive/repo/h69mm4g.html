<div class="md"><p>Neither one is better for you health-wise. You can do either one and benefit.</p>

<p>Given the nature of your question, however, I recognize that you do not have the knowledge to write your own program/routine. I recommend following one of these programs ordered according to quality and my own preference: Barbell Medicine Beginner Prescription, BioLayne Beginner Strength Building, Jeff Nippard Hypertrophy Fundamentals, BioLayne Beginner Muscle Building, and Westside for Skinny Bastards. Note that all of these cost money except WSFSB. The quality suffers in WSFSB, but I need to make a free recommendation. Ignore the name because it will work whether you are trying to just get in shape, get bigger, get stronger, or slim down. The writer does not allow for overhead presses and leaves a lot unsaid. I would modify the program to make overhead pressing an option and incorporate RPE or RIR, but this is going to force you to make decisions that you might find confusing and certainly aren&#39;t experienced for. So that is something to consider.</p>

<p>Ask your follow up questions, and if you need help getting started on the nutrition end, let me know.</p>

<p>Edit: I removed one of the programs because I no longer think it is a good recommendation.</p>
