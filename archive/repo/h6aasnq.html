Low Testosterone Bulking Strategy

<div class="post">
<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Just to start, I’m not looking for medical advice and I am planning to see my doctor next week. Just trying to see if anyone has experience with anything similar or any general suggestions. </p>

<p>So for some background, M22 6’1, currently ~155-160 lbs. I have been lifting consistently and trying to lean bulk for a few months now, and this was following a cut where I went from ~180 (of mostly fat) to as low as 146. I realized after a while that I was taking the cut way too far, especially because I had no frame of muscle underneath to cut to. So around April this year I decided to start eating at maintenance and have slowly transitioned into a lean bulk.</p>

<p>Towards the end of my cut around the end of 2020, I started to notice different things that signaled something wasn’t right. Sex drive / energy drastically dropped, and I just generally felt off. I figured these were just symptoms of eating too little fats / too little in general and going back to maintenance and eventually a surplus would fix the issues.</p>

<p>So as I said, I have been lifting / eating more since April, and my lifts / weight have slowly but steadily progressed over time. However, the symptoms of low sex drive / energy, although improving, haven’t gone away as I expected they would even when I started eating more. I decided to get bloodwork done (twice in the last few weeks) and my Testosterone levels came back at 100 and 104 ng/Dl, which are apparently very low levels given that the normal range is 250-827. (My results also showed high cortisol, low vitamin D and low Luteinizing hormone if those mean anything to anyone).</p>

<p>I am frustrated because I feel like I’m eating enough calories and protein, and ensuring I’m eating more healthy fats. (2500 cal / at least 150g protein daily). 2500 may not seem like a ton, but I have been gaining about 0.5-1 lb per week which is a good rate from what I understand, and I don’t want to go into a crazy surplus because I used to be pretty fat and don’t want to end up there again. I am also getting a good amount of sleep most days, and putting effort into my workouts and ensuring progressive overload. So all the “natural” ways to increase testosterone and lower cortisol I feel like I’m already doing. I will be meeting with my doctor in a few days to discuss my bloodwork results and next steps, but I was wondering if any of y’all had any suggestions about what I could be doing wrong or other ways that I could look to improve the symptoms of my low T.
Appreciate any advice/suggestions.</p>

<p>TLDR: Been bulking for a few months but testosterone levels still very low and cortisol levels are high. Feel like I am following good eating / lifting / lifestyle habits and slowly increasing my weight / lifts, yet still feeling other symptoms of low T.</p>

<p>Icing your balls a couple times a day. Won&#39;t help with OPs low LH but I guess it might help him get more T out of what little LH he does have?</p>

<p>LOL, what?</p>

<div class="md"><p>Been trying to remember where I heard that, with limited success. And a cursory google seems to suggest there&#39;s not a lot, if any, science to back it up.</p>

<p>t <em>feels</em> like it works when I remember to stick to it for more than a week - higher sex drive and I feel stronger after a few days. But that&#39;s far from proof.</p>

<p>I <em>think</em> I first heard it from <a href="https://youtu.be/SadcUFe2KZ8">this guy</a>, but in another video of his. But even his &quot;evidence&quot; is all anecdotal - his citations all seem to be about fertility, even though all he talks about is test. I&#39;m not going to bother tracking them all down.</p>

<div class="md"><p>Icing your balls is a bad idea, bud, if you want to boost test. Getting adequate sleep, lifting, losing weight if you are seriously obese with a high adipose composition, and dealing with stress in healthy ways such as seeking therapy/counseling to handle stress/depression/etc. are much more fruitful than anything you&#39;ve suggested here.</p>

<div class="md"><p>Eh... Alright. But I don&#39;t see how it could be harmful. I&#39;m not talking about submerging your ballsack in dry ice, just a bag of frozen peas or something near your nads for ten minutes two or three times a day. They&#39;re not going to get as cold as they would from being outside for ten minutes in January. It&#39;s mild contrast therapy, not cryoablation.</p>

<div class="md"><p>Don&#39;t get me wrong, blunting my sperm count naturally is awesome, but many individuals don&#39;t want that. </p>

<p>More importantly, why would I waste time doing something that both has not demonstrated any significant evidence, nor has any physiologic basis?</p>
