<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Hello there,</p>

<p>i was inspired by one of those &quot;100 Pushups a day for 30 days and see what happens&quot; videos and decided to try it. No idea how many days it took me but eventually i was able to do 100 pushups a day and actually became pretty fit and strong.</p>

<p>At some point however my left shoulder started to hurt - like from one day to the next. I think its due to shoulder impingement because i really worked and even grew my front delt. </p>

<p>Haven&#39;t done pushups in a while due to this but would like to start again. What exercise would be best to offset this push motion? Maybe mounting a pull-up bar halfway in my door frame and pulling up, as to have an exact &#39;reverse&#39; movement of the pushup? Or a face pull?</p>

<p>Thanks!</p>

<div class="md"><p>Possibly. I still think you misunderstood his point.</p>

<div class="md"><p>That doesn&#39;t make sense; if you understand exactly what I was driving at, then why is your response so disproportionate?</p>

<p>I mean, i know why, but i would like to hear your reasoning.</p>

<div class="md"><p>You mistakenly think the average person at stasis is a worthwhile benchmark for people who are training to stronger and generally fitter.  It isn&#39;t.  It&#39;s a useless self-congratulatory measuring stick that justifies not trying.  It&#39;s too low of a bar, especially if you live somewhere like America where the average person is a deconditioned slob.  It&#39;s not just useless, it&#39;s actually antithetical to progress. </p>

<p>The average person has the capacity to train up to 100 push-ups. Especially over a long period.  If a person is training to be strong, they need to compare themselves to some farther down the road who has been trying to be strong.        </p>

<p>The general attitude of this sub got even shittier than it already was with COVID and people looking for attaboys for putting in the least amount of effort.  You&#39;re making each other worse, not better.</p>
