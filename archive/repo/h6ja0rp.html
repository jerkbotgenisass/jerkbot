<p>1) He did not arch, if he did its no where near what xfit tells you to do.
2) arching the back in a lift is wrong and super unhealthy for the spine</p>

<div class="md"><p>You already proved it&#39;s irrelevant what someone&#39;s degree is in. I&#39;m having a hard time someone with a doctorate in pt is worried about the spine during a bench, again inquire for a refund.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I generally recommend most people to arch at least a little bit on the bench.  A little arch will help decrease range of motion a bit more.  This will generally help you lift more weight and, more importantly, it will make the lift a little bit safer for your shoulders since the bottom position is where your shoulders are the most vulnerable.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>He much more knowledgeable than both of on the bench, you could definitely learn something. </p>

<div class="md"><p>I got my science from an experienced strength athlete, coach, and exercise scientist. Greg probably has forgotten more about these lifts than you will ever know, especially with your toilet paper degree.</p>

<p>Have fun being confidently wrong I guess.</p>
