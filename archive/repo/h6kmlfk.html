<div class="md"><p>Do you not think you’re over complicating things here?</p>

<p>There is a high risk of injury if you fall from the ball.</p>

<p>Wouldn’t a simple say a single arm over head walking lung work a similar set of muscle groups?</p>

<div class="md"><p>It is not a specific muscle group workout. It is all around core and body control. And it guarantees no muscle imbalance. There are many levels before reaching that. But once you reach it, it is almost the same than standing up. You can injure yourself as any other workouts, if you overtake steps in your progression. 
When we were baby, standing up and walking was a lot more dangerous than crawling. Yet, our parents teach us how to walk and at some point it becomes natural. If you try to run without ever learning or training. You will injure yourself. 
And sincerely, it is very easy to learn how to fall (Which I never had to use in years of practice). 
This is not the type of exercice where you push your limits. But understand them and highlights your weaknesses.</p>

<div class="md"><p>Shouldnt Progression should be based on intensity, volume, frequency not how hard a circus trick is?</p>

<p>The risk/reward and bang/buck ratio is totally wrong here. Keep it simple and you’ll have much better outcomes long term.</p>
