<div class="md"><p>I mean it helps that almost no other grown adult in the world is that small and in an almost double digit (lbs) weight class for powerlifting.  This is like being the best Formula 1 driver in a league for specifically dwarves.</p>

<p>55kg is the size of an average 12 year old in most of the world. This weight class is essentially a participation medal competition for nations with comically tiny people.  “Wowee you competed against the other 5 people on the planet who are this tiny and deadlift/clean n jerk!  You’re a world champion.”  Fuck it, I’m the fastest person alive with my full name and born on my birthday.  Where’s my gold medal?</p>

<p>Big edit: Gotta love everyone getting mad at me for “body shaming” by calling me “little dick energy and obese”.  Y’all are kinda goofy, huh? People outside of the internet don’t view this as impressive, and it’s only receiving accolades on Reddit because people love pity upvotes for perennial losers who win once in a blue moon.  It’s a classic underdog story - an inspiration to hobbits everywhere, really. </p>

<p>She’s 4’10”.  She has to move the bar a fraction of the distance of someone who is 6’, she has a lower center of gravity, and she still barely squeaks past 2x bodyweight.  The Philippine government itself doesn&#39;t even give care - she had to self fund her Olympic journey. </p>

<p>110million people, a century+ of Games, and this is the first Gold Medal. Could you imagine the collective embarrassment and mockery on reddit if that was the case for a country like Germany, or Ethiopia, whose populations are somewhat comparable? The memes that would generate?</p>

<p>Most countries on Earth don’t even make adults that small - so she’s ostensibly competing against Guatemalans and literal dwarves from China. Not exactly an Olympic sized talent pool to compete against.</p>
