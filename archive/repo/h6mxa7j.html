keto induced reactive hypoglycaemia

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I didn’t have reactive hypoglycaemia before keto, but since I started every time I eat my blood sugar drops to the point I feel I am about to faint. It is not electrolytes. I could literally go all day without eating and get no blood sugar drops, but as soon as I eat something, my blood sugar drops. </p>

<p>Example today, my blood sugar was fine when I woke up, ate my friend meal at 1pm, 2 eggs with onion and a spoonful of almond butter as soon as I finished my blood sugar dropped.</p>

<p>then I ate lunch at 3pm 2 chicken things and half a zucchini, as soon as I was finish my blood sugar dropped a lot and I almost passed out. </p>

<p>I have no idea why this happens. I just ordered a glucometer. I may also mention that this blood sugar drops are more intense during the day, at night I don’t really get them. Could it be cortisol related? I do have high cortisol and high aldosterone. Any advice would be really helpful....</p>

<div class="md"><p>I have a theory (I&#39;m not a doctor). So here&#39;s what&#39;s going on with you, and it&#39;s normal. </p>

<p>Our bodies can grow accustomed to eating at certain times and/or consisting of meals of certain macro percentages. For instance, if you always eat breakfast at 8 am, your brain and pancreas will get used to that schedule and start producing insulin BEFORE YOU&#39;VE EVEN EATEN. Sugar is so toxic in the blood, that even a healthy pancreas can&#39;t necessarily keep up with the amount of carbs we often eat at breakfast, so you start making insulin before you even eat. And because you&#39;re accustomed to sugar-bomb meals, your brain and pancreas are accustomed to providing enough insulin to counteract those carbs. Or even if they don&#39;t start before you eat, they&#39;re still trained to assume they&#39;ll need to make enough insulin to work for a 80 carb meal, or 120 carbs, or whatever.</p>

<p>Now, for you, you&#39;re not eating those carbs now. But your pancreas and brain are still like &quot;Woah boy, they&#39;re eating a meal, we gotta get in gear!&quot; So they&#39;re still releasing the same amount of insulin even though you stop eating food before you get to that usual carb load you&#39;ve trained them to anticipate. So they&#39;re still making 80-carbs-worth of insulin, but you&#39;ve only eaten 10. That extra insulin stays in your system and can make your blood glucose levels drop farther than typical.</p>

<p>This is why when you mention that it doesn&#39;t happen when you fast, I figured out my guess for what is happening. It&#39;s happening because when you start to eat, your body is expecting that 80 carbs.</p>

<p>IM NOT A DOCTOR. I honestly don&#39;t think anything is wrong. I know you&#39;re feeling a bit faint right now after you eat. Eventually your body will relearn how much insulin to make when you eat. My suggestions IM NOT A DOCTOR is switch over to 20 net carbs, make sure you&#39;re drinking some salty broth with your meals, maybe go a little bit higher protein right now, and keep doing the IF.</p>

<div class="md"><p>I think your theory is right! I have also been thinking about this... my body is used to meals with carbs so as soon as it senses that I am eating something even if it’s very low carb, it releases insulin and since I ate almost no carbs that makes me crash... thanks a lot for sharing all of these information!!</p>
