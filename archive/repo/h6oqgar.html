<div class="md"><p>I would need some advice on this one: I&#39;m a man and I&#39;m currently focusing mainly on the compound lifts: bench press, OHP, deadlift, chin ups, pull ups and of course, the squat.</p>

<p>However, and this is gonna sound funny but I&#39;m serious, I noticed that my butt is getting really big. With muscle. It seems to be responding much better than my quads themselves. I think it&#39;s the squats that do this? Is there anything I can do to make my butt not grow so much without forsaking the squat which is, I suppose, a very important movement?</p>

<p>Sorry if it&#39;s a silly question.</p>
