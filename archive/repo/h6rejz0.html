<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>So I screwed my early years up being fat and anxious and ballooned up to 230 at my worst 5 months ago. I’m 5’6 220 now due to high protein diet, IF, and lifting. But the fact that I ballooned up to such a horrendous weight will it be possible for me to ever get down under 200? My goal is 160 rn. I mean if so this gym training and diet has been a waste. I just need a honest answer. Help?</p>

<div class="md"><p>You will definitely be able to get to your goal but the only thing that’s stopping you is YOU! You have to want it bad enough to be able to diet perfectly and follow a good workout routine that will get you towards your goals.</p>

<div class="md"><p>You haven’t ruined your life at all… You’re a young 22 year old. My older brother is actually turning 23 soon at 5’8 280. It makes me so upset of how much he weighs and how much he doesn’t do anything to better himself. At least you are trying to make a change and that’s the first step. You got this</p>

<div class="md"><p>That is not at all what I was saying… I was saying good for you for trying because if you don’t start you will never finish. But it seems like all you want to hear is no you can’t do it. YOU HAVE TO FUCKING WANT IT! No one can help you lose weight besides yourself.</p>

<div class="md"><p>Stop feeling sorry for yourself and just do it. At my heaviest I was 230 lbs and now I’m 175 lbs and in the best shape of my life at age 33. You have to stop doubting yourself and listening to others. Set goals and crush them.</p>

<div class="md"><p>... I&#39;m  5&#39;8&quot; at 220. My %bf dropping down to single digits would still have me at overweight or obese.  I body built for 5 years.  </p>

<p>Take photos.  Check %bf. Gaining muscle and losing weight is a thing which can fuck with your mind.  I&#39;ve seen people LOOK skinnier but WEIGHED more.  </p>

<p>Do it.  Keep going.</p>

<div class="md"><p>I was 220 and dropped to 165. Its 100% possible, take some deep breaths and recognize that it’s a marathon not a sprint. You won’t lose that weight in the gym only, your diet is by far the most important thing. There’s lots of advice on this sub about it, use the search bar and you’ll find your answers. Don’t panic, just do some research and you’ll be okay.</p>

<div class="md"><p>Why? An Argentinean streamer called Papo MC shared his whole one year journey with his viewers as he went, the whole ups and downs, sacrifice and hardship, getting from around 260+ to around 195
Is it easy? No. Impossible? Also no. He&#39;s pushing 30, you&#39;re younger, your body responds to changes much better.
His main advise after all this was diet first, work out is secondary. In fact working out was harming his process early on because he&#39;d over eat in compensation, and his body would hurt from having to carry all that weight through workouts.</p>

<p>Good luck friend, don&#39;t give up.</p>
