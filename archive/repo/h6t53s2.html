<div class="md"><p>Once you lose weight, there is nothing tremendously straining about maintaining your current weight. Otherwise we&#39;d all be obese.</p>

<div class="md"><p>It is when you&#39;re thin.  It means eating salads all day and eating at most one small piece of bread throughout the entire day.  It means feeling worn out all the time if it isn&#39;t your ideal weight.  Combined with the busy work schedule, yes, it is a bit difficult to maintain.</p>

<p>Frankly you shouldn&#39;t encourage that sort of thing.  Being an actor/actress is not about being paid to gain or lose weight, period.</p>

<p>Edit:  To those of you who disagree and feel actors and actresses should be forced to gain/ lose weight, that&#39;s kind of  a shitty stance to have if I&#39;m being honest.   I stand by my statement.  Downvote away.</p>

<p>Edit edit:  After careful reconsideration of my position, I have decided that yes, you&#39;re still pieces of shit for thinking that.</p>

<div class="md"><p>Man props to you for standing up to fat phobic Reddit. Agree 100% with this. itâ€™s really NOT as simple as ci/co and over the long term weight suppression can be a very taxing and exhausting thing for people who are already at a normal weight.</p>

<div class="md"><p>Thank you for that comment.  If losing weight were as easy as simply consuming less calories, then why would anyone voluntarily be obese?  It&#39;s an absurd argument.  I don&#39;t really mind the downvotes so much, though.  If I did I would have long since removed that comment by now.  Getting downvoted for the right reasons is a sort of badge of honor for me.</p>

<div class="md"><p>So a 200 kg woman likes being 200 kg?  Prefers it even because they like to eat?  I&#39;m not saying such a woman shouldn&#39;t lose weight, but that&#39;s kind of besides the point.  I&#39;d think if they could lose the weight by snapping their fingers, they would.

<p>Of course it isn&#39;t as easy as snapping your fingers, that&#39;s precisely my point.  There was an obese man who went 382 days without consuming anything save for vitamins, supplements, and liquids and at the end of which he was still obese.  </p>

<p>I can&#39;t even imagine the kind of willpower you&#39;d have to have to accomplish that.  It could have quite easily have been fatal without the proper vitamins.  </p>

<p>But then I suspect, it doesn&#39;t really even matter what I tell you at this point.  You&#39;re just trolling me.</p>

<p>&quot;At the end of his ordeal, Barbieri tipped the scales at 180 pounds. Five years later, he&#39;d still kept almost all the weight he&#39;d lost off, weighing in at 196 (89 kg).&quot; </p>

<p>bro.. fasting is very healthy for you. and ketogenic diets greatly reduce the cravings for food you get, fasting isn&#39;t that hard when your body adjusts. nothing like the sugar and carb cravings you get on standard western diets. you should look at some of the science done on it. obviously 382 days is extreme, but being 450lbs is extreme as well. your body can live off fat and vitamins for a long long time. you don&#39;t need carbs to live and you only need a little bit of protein.</p>

<div class="md"><p>Obesity is defined by 30 or more BMI.  By my calculations at 89kg, he&#39;d have had to be under 1.72 meters high to still be considered obese.  That&#39;s not an unreasonable conclusion.  </p>

<p>that&#39;s the height of a woman lol. so yeah it&#39;s an unreasonable conclusion. yeah a 180lb woman is obese, but a 180lb man is not. considering 180lbs was his &quot;Ideal weight&quot; and he doesn&#39;t look obese anymore in the photo, I&#39;m guessing he&#39;s atleast 5&#39;10&quot; and not obese. would be kind of unreasonable and illogical to assume his ideal weight is still obese wouldn&#39;t it?</p>

<p>Because people often do things that feel good in the moment without regard for the long-term consequences. </p>

<p>Humans are generally bad at making these sorts of judgements. Immediate gratification is usually the easier choice; the &quot;long term&quot; is much harder to conceive. It&#39;s particularly tricky with a behaviour which is so frequently repeated, as we tend to form habits - once a &quot;bad&quot; pattern of behaviour is ingrained it can be hard to overcome. So it takes both a significant intellectual effort of understanding and self-reflection, and an iron self-discipline to break that pattern, even though ultimately what you are doing really is as simple as consuming fewer calories than you expend.</p>

<div class="md"><p>I agree with this, except that isn&#39;t voluntary.  Voluntary would imply they wanted to be obese. Doing something that ultimately causes you to end up being in an undesirable situation doesn&#39;t mean you wanted to be in an undesirable situation anymore than gambling addicts voluntarily want to be broke.</p>

<p>Of course they should assess these consequences, but they don&#39;t.  That doesn&#39;t make it any more voluntary imho, otherwise you could argue anybody who has ever done anything risky and ended up dying as a consequence wanted to die.  &quot;Smokers are voluntary suiciders&quot; for instance.</p>

<div class="md"><p>Honestly I thought it was weird when you used the word &quot;voluntary&quot; in the first place - I feel like maybe it&#39;s not quite what you mean or I am not understanding your point.</p>

<p>I&#39;m not arguing that people <em>want</em> the negative outcomes, I&#39;m arguing that people often choose behaviours that lead to negative outcomes <em>despite</em> not wanting the negative outcomes. Of course a person isn&#39;t choosing to become obese, or to develop lung cancer, or whatever. But if they choose behaviours that have those consequences then it amounts to the same thing. Unintended consequences are still consequences.</p>

<p>It seems like you&#39;re arguing that the unintended but forseeable negative consequences of an action should be considered &quot;involuntary&quot;, if they are sufficiently far-removed from the action that caused them. I&#39;m interested in knowing where you would draw that line? If someone jumps off a bridge, how long would they need to be falling for before you decide hitting the ground wasn&#39;t voluntary?</p>

<div class="md"><p>It is literally as easy as consuming less calories. I&#39;m obese because I eat/ate too much. If I ate less I wouldn&#39;t be. It&#39;s extremely simple from a food goes in kind of perspective. Don&#39;t try to spread misinformation.</p>

<div class="md"><p>It&#39;s &quot;easy&quot; in the sense that it&#39;s straightforward.  If it were easy as in &quot;easy&quot; to lose weight, why would there be overweight people?  How about you stop acting like losing weight is as easy as riding a bicycle?  It clearly isn&#39;t..</p>
