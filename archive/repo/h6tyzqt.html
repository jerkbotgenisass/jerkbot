<p>I saw a study once that had various groups of people either lift weights with no testosterone, lift weights and take testosterone, take testosterone but not lift weights, and a control group that did nothing.</p>

<p>That group that took the T and didn&#39;t have a training regimen built more muscle than than the ones that lifted weights without taking T.</p>

<div class="md"><p>I have trouble believing this based on how artificial testosterone works.</p>

<p>I mean it improves healing rates, so these people are still damaging muscles somehow.</p>

<p>EDIT: Already found one problem. It said that the weight lifting group performed weight training 3 times weekly.</p>

<p>A large part of the point of testosterone is that it improves muscle recovery rates, so you can train the same muscle groups more frequently. These guys were only training three times a week. I doubt they were doing the right amount of training to see increased muscle gain.</p>

<div class="md"><p>Depends on what you mean by &quot;healing and recovery&quot;. </p>

<p>Weight-training creates microtears in the muscle that must be healed. This requires protein synthesis which depends on DNA transcription. This DNA transcription depends on testosterone. These tears are repaired and additional muscle fibers are added to decrease the likelihood of repeat microtears. In addition, the stimulus of heavy weight stimulates DNA transcription and protein synthesis as well. So you have microtears being repaired and overall growth of the affected muscle in response to lifting. This is all regulated by testosterone. More testosterone = quicker repair and a greater response to stimuli. </p>

<p>Tendon and ligament tears, which are pathological, have been shown to heal faster when exposed to supraphysiological doses of HGH. HGH also has an impact on muscle growth.</p>

<div class="md"><p>The muscle is often weird though. My bf is really into body building and he can look at someone and tell immediately if they are on any kind of steroid. He only has done one round of testosterone once before the only big competition he ever did and wouldn&#39;t do it again, but he used to hang around juicers a lot and even had to help a guy at his gym inject it every day for money, so he knows what it looks like. Apparently there&#39;s a guy at our gym who is using steroids but not working out properly or enough (spends much of his time at the gym sitting on his phone) and he is a big guy, but does have a strange muscle distribution. I wouldn&#39;t be able to pick it out but he&#39;s shown me pictures and it definitely looks like that&#39;s whats up. </p>

<p>There&#39;s a subreddit called <a href="/r/nattyorjuice">r/nattyorjuice</a> where people guess if a person is using steroids and he can call it like immediately.</p>

<div class="md"><p>The most commonly misinterpreted study in the realm of people who don&#39;t understand bodybuilding/AAS who want to comment on how steroids do everything for you. This study demonstrates that LEAN BODY MASS increases while using AAS (in this case 600mg Testosterone per week). LEAN BODY MASS includes water and glycogen. Testosterone, like most AAS, rapidly increase glycogen reuptake which adds fluid mass to muscle bellies. This <em>is not</em> new muscle tissue. Additionally, Testosterone aromatizes into Estrogen which increases subcutaneous water retention. You know how women often report fluctuations in bodyweight alongside their menstrual cycle? Would you consider their 5lbs of increased bloat to be increased muscle?  </p>

<p>Anyone who takes 600mg a week of Testosterone for 10-12 weeks and makes no additional changes will see no improvements in muscle mass or strength 6 weeks after stopping supplementation.  </p>

<div class="md"><p>If you were only comparing immediate strength increase, i.e. 3 identical people, 1 control, 1 creatine loaded, 1 testosterone loaded, yes, the actual mechanisms in which the creatine loaded and testosterone loaded individuals outperformed the control on a 1-rep-max would be very similar, coming down largely to increased leverage from glycogen/water retention. That being said androgen-loaded individuals continue to have the CNS advantage and the upper limits of increased glycogen retention are far higher with AAS use than creatine use.  </p>

<p>You&#39;re absolutely welcome to explain why the mechanism of strength increase is actually relevant, or prove that increased leverage actually accounts for the entirety of the strength increase (10kg increase in max bench, 13 kg in squat, over 10 weeks).</p>

<p>You&#39;re doing nothing but nitpicking. People took steroids, did nothing, and were stronger and bigger afterwards, moreso than the people who actually exercised. That&#39;s all that&#39;s relevant.</p>

<p>I get it, the study upsets you because it further underlines just how much of an effect PEDs have, but this isn&#39;t about your ego.</p>

<p>Nope, you called explanation of increased specious, I took that to mean that it is literally incorrect. You said I&#39;m incorrect. Correct me.  </p>

<p>Is it? Because you said you gain muscle, which I told you I interpret as muscle tissue, which is a fair assumption I think. If you&#39;d like to amend your statement to &quot;Individuals who take 600mg/week of Testosterone Enanthate can note an increase in lean body mass through increased glycogen retention as well as subcutaneous water&quot; then I will agree with you completely!  </p>

<p>Surely you must just be having a hard time interpreting tone through text, I don&#39;t blame you, it can be tough sometimes. That being said, no, this study doesn&#39;t upset me. I appreciate that this study exists, it&#39;s one of the first studies I ever read on the subject of AAS prior to starting use/abuse of PEDs myself. I personally would love to have seen a 12 week extension of this study and a bit more critical thought put into better analysis of the increase in LBM. But you have to start somewhere, right? The trouble with this particular study is the absence of additional/follow-up information, which leads to individuals like yourself, who are effectively illiterate on the subject, making incorrect inferences or drawing inaccurate/misleading conclusions. It&#39;s not an ego thing. If you were right, I would say you&#39;re right. If steroids + couch really did lead to significant muscle tissue gains, I would be completely okay with that. If steroids + couch really did lead to significant (and lasting) strength gains, I would be okay with that. Maybe that&#39;s the difference between you and me?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>No they&#39;re not, that&#39;s the funny thing. You can actually gain muscle and strength by literally just taking the right gear and not even working out.  </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Here&#39;s your original statement once more (btw it&#39;s not that funny). At the very best it is misleading, at worst its just an entirely illiterate interpretation of literature on the subject.  </p>

<p>It&#39;s cool if AAS and/or weightlifting/bodybuilding aren&#39;t for you but there&#39;s no reason to denigrate the achievements of professionals by deliberately misinterpreting studies on the subject.</p>

<p>LOL. Is this a criminal proceeding?

<p>You okay chief? You think that distinguishing the difference between muscle tissue and lean body mass is an &quot;incredibly technical, no-one-fucking-cares degree&quot; of nitpicking? If so I would like to politely disagree, I think most people would actually find this to be a very useful distinction. In the context of bodybuilding competitors actively try to reduce subcutaneous water as much as possible to avoid appearing bloated or &quot;spilled over&quot;, would you tell them that they should do the opposite because more water = more muscle? </p>

<p>No, it&#39;s an argument, to which the burden of proof applies. I don&#39;t have to prove you wrong, you have to prove yourself right, and &quot;relatively well accepted&quot; doesn&#39;t cut the mustard.</p>

<p>As already pointed out, no one&#39;s &quot;misinterpreting&quot; anything, I all but quoted the study verbatim. You&#39;re the one trying to grasp at straws, inventing irrelevant distinctions for god knows what reason. I already quoted the summary at you, you&#39;ve apparently read the thing, at this point either take it up with them, do your own study to prove them wrong with water leverage or whatever you think is going on, or shut up. You&#39;re not arguing with my &quot;inferences&quot;, despite what you may think, you&#39;re just incapable of accepting the simple fact that steroids make you bigger and stronger in and of themselves, so you try to draw a distinction between the strength and muscles achieved by the steroids alone and what is achieved by exercise - a distinction no one cares about, <em>even if it exists</em>, which you haven&#39;t proven.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>Yes, completely and totally. Nothing in this thread has anything to do with bodybuilding. You take drugs, you get bigger, you get stronger, no exercise required. <em>Fact</em>. Anything further is extraneous addenda that interests no one outside of meathead gym rats.</p>

<p>If you could only pick one between blasting testosterone and working out, the testosterone would give you superior results.
