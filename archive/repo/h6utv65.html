<div class="md"><p>is there any downside to not doing deadlifts? </p>

<p>ive been lifting 6 days a week for about 4 months and have made decent progress, however i have never deadlifted once. mainly because my brother (who is much stronger then me and has been lifting for years) messed up his back doing deadlifts. another friend of mine hurt his back as well. both guys who usually have impeccable form. </p>

<p>imo deadlifting is just too risky as I don’t wanna mess up my back. is there any downside to not doing deadlifts?</p>

<div class="md"><p>Easy answer is majority of  pro athlete are not allowed to do deadlifts because they are dangerous and can easily put an athlete out. You can accommodate with other workouts. I too do not touch deadlifts nor squats</p>

<div class="md"><p>Besides the fact that you missed a ton of nuance in your excuse against deadlifts, I’m pretty certain that the guy asking this question is not a pro athlete. In fact, I’m pretty certain that everybody asking questions in this thread is not a pro athlete.</p>

<div class="md"><p>No ones a pro athlete. And if his main worry was about injuries I gave a reason why athletes don’t. Because people are stupid and add bunch of weight and hurt themselves or bad form. I don’t like them at all. That’s just me</p>

<div class="md"><p>If you don’t like them you don’t have to do them. That is perfectly fine. </p>

<p>What is not fine is trying to nocebo somebody into avoiding a movement because of something you read on the internet one time that “pro athletes don’t deadlift”.</p>

<div class="md"><p>Bro stfu this is stupid argument. Go tell him why to do them simple. So many people don’t do them because people get hurt. It’s not fine to tell me not to tell him to do deadlifts because you saw on the internet to do them</p>

<div class="md"><p>This is wrong. In this day and age, most pro athletes don‘t do straight bar deadlifts. Trap Bar is usually preferred, RDL‘s and the like also have their place. So yes, they deadlift, most just don’t straight bar deadlift. </p>

<p>Throwers, Contact Sports athletes and dudes like Bob pushers do a fuckton of cleans as well, which trains the hinge as well.</p>

<div class="md"><p>Injuries from deadlifting are rarely about bad for and almost always associated with improper load management.  Furthermore, they carry no greater risk than any other standard barbell movement.  So, I wouldn’t be afraid of doing them and one of the best ways to protect your back is to have a strong back.</p>

<p>To answer your direct question, you’ll want some sort of hip hinge movement or work on the hamstrings, glutes, and lower back.  Deadlifts are an incredible exercise that are effective at hitting the entire posterior chain.  To replace them, you need to add a bunch of stuff in.</p>
