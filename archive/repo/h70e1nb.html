<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>This is pretty much a post I&#39;m making before going off to college. Definitely only the beginning of my journey, but a great foundation.</p>

<h1>Athletic history:</h1>

<p>I had done sports pretty much my entire life, most notably fencing 4 days/12 hours per week from 2016-March 2018. I quit fencing and didn&#39;t do anything until November 2018 when I started messing around at my school gym.</p>

<h1>Training</h1>

<p>I started going to the gym consistently at the start of 2019, though I didn&#39;t have a program. The starting lifting numbers are slightly inaccurate because I didn&#39;t max out lifts such as squats until much later. I remember failing a 115lbs bench very early in my training, and the 255lbs squat didn&#39;t come until around April or May of that year. My lifts at the end of this period were: 75kg/165 bench and 115/255 squat. I weighed 70kg/155 lbs.</p>

<p>At the start of summer, I switched to <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Fitness/comments/37ylk5/a_linear_progression_based_ppl_program_for/">reddit PPL</a> and made great gains. After 2 months, bench shot up to around 88kg/195 lbs and I gained some experience deadlifting. I weighed 72kg/155lbs. Because I was starting a new school year, I switched to <a href="https://thefitness.wiki/routines/nsuns-lp/">nSuns</a> and really started going hard (2hrs+ sessions). During Late October, I maxed out again and hit a 95kg/210 lbs bench, 129/285 squat, and the heaviest I ever deadlifted was 137kg/300 lbs for 6.</p>

<p>After watching a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nfA8rAfHSI">weightlifting video that got on my youtube recommended</a>, I fell into the rabbit hole, watching <a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/clarence0">Clarence</a>, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uoj4DsAwJwg">Ashgabat</a>, and all types of weightlifting content. I decided to switch to weightlifting in November.</p>

<p>My weightlifting training has been pretty inconsistent: November 2019-February 2020, August 2020-October 2020, March 2021-today for a total of 12 out of 21 months. I also only train 3 days a week (my coach runs his gym as a passion project, so it&#39;s only open 3days/wk) which is significantly lower than nSuns or PPL. My weight also fluctuated a lot. I weighed 75kg/165lbs right before quarantine but dropped all the way to 70kg/155lbs by August 2020. I made it up to around 76/168 lbs in October but managed to keep my weight despite not training and I&#39;ve been pretty stable at 82kg/180 lbs for a few months now.</p>

<p>Regardless of inconsistent training and weight, I made great squat PRs, hitting 145kg/321lbs in December 2019, 127kg/280 x 5 in October 2020, 143kg/315lbs x 5 in May 2021, and 162kg/357lbs for my first double bodyweight squat in June 2021. I had and have injuries in my wrist, so I&#39;ve been unable to train the snatch for about 2 months, and I recently injured my shoulder so I wasn&#39;t able to do anything overhead for around 3 weeks.</p>

<p>I haven&#39;t benched for almost a year now and I haven&#39;t deadlifted anything above 130kg/286 lbs because I can only clean 118kg/260lbs.</p>

<h1>Diet</h1>

<p>I don&#39;t have a very precise diet. I make sure to limit sugar heavily (only milk and water for the past 3-4 years, no candy, no ice cream, no sweet snacks like cookies/brownies) and roughly hit my calories/protein. However, more often than not I end up not eating enough. I usually eat 2 meals a day, sometimes only 1 because my sleep schedule is terrible. In college I hope to bulk up a lot because I&#39;ll have a much better diet.</p>

<p>For supplements, I never took anything until the start of July of this year, when I started taking creatine and vitamin D. I started drinking protein shakes but that&#39;s not really a supplement(?).</p>

<h1>Physique</h1>

<p>Physique was never really one of my main goals but of course it&#39;s a nice bonus. Sucks that I couldn&#39;t get pictures of my legs before working out, but they were still pretty big regardless because of all the fencing (and soccer/track as well). I just wanted an opinion, do I really look like I&#39;m 180 lbs? I always look at other people and think to myself like damn they&#39;re huge!, only for them to weigh less than me.</p>

<p>Some of my biggest inspirations are <a href="https://imgur.com/a/rDvicTd">apti aukadov</a>, <a href="https://i.ytimg.com/vi/k2zSsPxVCMs/maxresdefault.jpg">toshiki yamamoto</a>, and <a href="https://www.thehandbook.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=300,height=300,fit=cover,q=85/https://files.thehandbook.com/uploads/2020/03/44378283-335510077244129-2228533361662492672-n.jpg">tian tao</a>... Absolutely monstrous quads and a ripped, aesthetic upper body is a killer combination</p>

<h1>What&#39;s next?</h1>

<p>I&#39;m going to continue weightlifting for probably the rest of my life. I hope to squat 270kg and have a weightlifting total over 300kg one day. My current goal is a 200 kg squat by the time I&#39;m 19 (next february) and to qualify for usaw junior nationals next year. In college I might do some bodybuilding and accessory training that I&#39;ve been neglecting, and maybe even bench a little. I plan to bulk to 89kg and maybe far in the future 96kg (based on weight classes).</p>

<p>Thanks for reading, and thank you to my coach, teammates, reddit for their resources, and various youtube channels. If you&#39;re still reading thank you as well!</p>
