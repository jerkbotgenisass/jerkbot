<div class="md"><p>Lower your weight, use the bar only to get the form right first. Keep your head straight, you&#39;re putting pressure on your neck by looking up. Don&#39;t squat the deadlift, keep your knees straight and don&#39;t move them up and down. The placement of your hands is confusing, both of them are placed in different position, keep your hands facing to the inside of your body, not the outside. Work on your muscle mind connection, you need to work on core strength. I can tell by the video you have really bad posture on your daily basis, deadlifts are hard to perform since you need to keep your shoulders, hips and spine in alignment. Watch a YouTube video and try to copy by looking at the mirror or with this recording, it&#39;s easy to tell what you&#39;re doing wrong, no one needs to point it out, you can look it up yourself and tell the difference.</p>
