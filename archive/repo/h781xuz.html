<div class="md"><p>I didn’t say that, you did. I actually don’t stay on TRT all year around. Mostly just for bulking purposes. When I’m off I don’t lose any noticeable muscle. I was asked a question if I’m on TRT and I answered as to currently.</p>

<p>So you used TRT like a Anabolic Steroid to briefly increase your T levels, then you got off it because you never needed it anyway.... If it was medically necessary you would not have stopped treatment.   </p>

<p>I have no problem with its use, just with people who are dishonest with its use. Your results are not achievable at your age in the time period you describe with an age appropriate T level. You prove this by admitting you too it &quot;During bulking only&quot;  </p>

<p>Face it, your physique isn&#39;t you, it was the drugs.... nothing wrong with that, but it is akin to plastic surgery IMHO</p>

<div class="md"><p>He isn&#39;t on TRT though, that seems like the primary issue the guy has with what OP is saying. Yes he&#39;s being honest that he&#39;s using exogenous hormones but dishonest about it being TRT. You don&#39;t cycle TRT, or only hop on when you want to bulk. That&#39;s literally just a steroid cycle lol</p>

<div class="md"><p>He’s probably being prescribed legit TRT at will by one of these slightly shady “men’s health clinics” where you can get prescribed all the ED meds and TRT you want as long as you’re paying.</p>

<p>The guy I responded to is just fucked in the head and worrying way too much about what other people are doing. It’s not like OP is even trying to deny what’s what.</p>

<div class="md"><p>Most likely the case! While I appreciate the fact that he has admitted to being on something, I don&#39;t think it&#39;s good to use the term TRT to describe what he&#39;s doing. I wouldn&#39;t want people to think that legit TRT is something you do for a bit then stop when you are done bulking. Fucking with your hormones is no joke, just dont want it being downplayed like oh it&#39;s just TRT where in reality he&#39;s doing low to moderate dose test cycles not TRT</p>
