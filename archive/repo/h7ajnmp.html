<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I have been carnivor for 60ish days now. I have not been perfect but I am doing my best. I would say I am 97% meat and less than 10 carbs a day. 
The scale keeps going up. I need to lose 50+ lbs. I know weight game can happen in the beginning but I can not find anything that says how long it lasts. I am positive I am not in ketosis. I know this is not a fast thing but I feel like I should be seeing some change by now.</p>

<div class="md"><p>Carnivore isn’t really a weight loss diet. It’s a healing diet. If you want to lose weight you can start tracking calories or just keep going. As you mentioned, you’re body needs to heal before it will drop some weight. </p>

<p>Being in ketosis wouldn’t matter anyways. Weight loss isn’t driven by ketosis.</p>

<div class="md"><p>No.... It&#39;s an outdated and neglective belief. One calorie does not equal a calorie from a different source for the body.
As an example, I&#39;ve been eat approx 4000kcal per day during my time with the carnivore diet. I&#39;ve lost 14kg of weight. Previously I ate about 2800kcal kcal every day, and I was gaining weight.</p>

<div class="md"><p>Your metabolic rate increased as you gained lean mass. That doesn’t invalidate CICO though. No not all calories are equal but they’re not completely irrelevant either.</p>

<p>When people try your “eat when hungry until full” strategy and do not get the results they’re looking for, it’s time to try something new. That was the case for me. It wasn’t until I dropped dietary fat that I started to drop body fat.</p>

<p>To OP: Start doing resistance training to increase lean mass which will increase your metabolic rate. Do that for 2-3 months and then begin to taper down the fat intake. You can do it sooner but you may be hit with fatigue if you make too many changes at once.</p>

<div class="md"><p>Because theyd realize the only way they are losing weight is because tgey suddenly halved their cals. Ive been there. Lost 20lbs first 2 weeks then hit a hiatus. But like the man before me said, carno is not a weight loss diet. Why is everyone treating it like one...</p>
