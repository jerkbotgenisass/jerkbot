AITA for watching my pregnant wife's calorie intake?

<p>I (29m) and my wife (27f) are expecting our first child. Before the pregnancy my was extremely fit (went to the gym 4 times a week). As many of you may know pregnancy can cause some crazy cravings for potentially high calorie food (ice cream, peanut butter, junk food). Lately my wife has been eating more food than I believe to be healthy for an average adult woman. </p>

<p>Last night I brought the subject up to my wife. I explained to her that the amount she&#39;s eating is not healthy and she would regret it as soon as the baby comes. She immediately got upset with me saying that I dont understand what she&#39;s dealing, with which is not true by the way, and that she is &quot;eating for 2&quot;. I told her that plenty of women eat healthy throughout their pregnancy and I would even help her with a meal plan. </p>

<p>She has been giving me the silent treatment since our conversation even though I had nothing but her best interest at heart. I don&#39;t think she understands the impact of her actions. </p>

<p>AITA?</p>

<div class="md"><p>You know what she&#39;s dealing with, you say. You&#39;ve been pregnant then? Because unless you have, then no you don&#39;t. </p>

<p>YTA. Sit down, shut up, and don&#39;t offer your grown ass wife unsolicited advice. Be supportive. Realize it&#39;s going to take a year after delivery for her body to be hers again, and realize it&#39;s never going to look or function exactly the same either. Accept this and support her when she realizes this. Don&#39;t offer advice or solutions. Just support her.</p>

<p>Repeat after me. No advice. Only support.</p>

<p>Editing to add, she&#39;s not the average adult woman. She&#39;s an individual pregnant adult woman. &quot;Maybe she doesn&#39;t care about her body anymore&quot; or &quot;I&#39;m shallow and afraid my wife is going to gain weight&quot;?</p>

<div class="md"><p>I actually just read this article that I feel is relevant. Scientists looked at caloric usage in all different types of lifestyles (sedentary office workers, athletes, hunter gathering societies) and found that there was really not a huge amount of variation in the amount of calories burned on a daily basis. Apparently the human body adjusts to activity level very easily and becomes more efficient at other processes (digestion, respiration, and such) so that even the most active societies didn’t burn calories at a rate people would think. The one exception and, according to this scientist, and the most calorie intensive activities the human body can ever do is pregnancy and breastfeeding. Apparently pregnancy pushes the body harder than most endurance sports. All this to say, this guy needs to stop. His wife is literally growing a person.</p>

<div class="md"><p>Science and Pseudo-science are not the same. Exercise and diet are still the most effective forms of weight management. It&#39;s a simple &quot;calories in, calories out&quot; equation with about 70% being intake and 30% related to expenditure. Yeah, exercise isn&#39;t the major contributing factor to weight maintenance, but caloric intake is.</p>

<p>If you take in more than you burn, your body will retain the excess in fat tissues. 3000kcal is equivelant to one pound of fat.</p>

<p>It baffles me that our standards don&#39;t transcend topics. </p>

<p>People can read a single article or book from one or few qualified individuals and extrapolate a stance based on the information given. That&#39;s bad science.</p>

<p>Somehow though, it&#39;s acceptable when applicable to a lifestyle. This same mentality is leading to a failure in vaccination efforts with CoVID. </p>

<p>&quot;I read an article from so-so that said,&quot; is fine when relevant to exercise, but an abhorrent sin when in relation to the vaccine effort. In reality, it&#39;s an incorrect stance either way.</p>

<div class="md"><p>I’m not going to argue about this- I thought it was an interesting perspective in the context of the post. But here is the bio of the researcher-  Herman Pontzer is an Associate Professor of Evolutionary Anthropology at Duke University and Associate Research Professor of Global Health at the Duke Global Health Institute. He is an internationally recognized researcher in human energetics and evolution. Over two decades of research in the field and laboratory, Dr. Pontzer has conducted pathbreaking studies across a range of settings, including fieldwork with Hadza hunter-gatherers in northern Tanzania, fieldwork on chimpanzee ecology in the rainforests of Uganda, and metabolic measurements of great apes in zoos and sanctuaries around the globe. Dr. Pontzer&#39;s work has been covered in The New York Times, BBC, PBS, Washington Post, The Atlantic, NPR, Scientific American, and others.</p>

<div class="md"><p>All he said was exactly what we practice now.</p>

<p>Nomadic hunter-gatherers moved more frequently, thus burning more calories. </p>

<p>It&#39;s really not an argument. Calories in -&gt; calories out. </p>

<p>Dr. Oz makes a lot of wild claims too, with plenty of qualifications under his belt.</p>

<p>If you are interested in the science of exercise, please study exercise science, aka Kinesiology.</p>

I’m not claiming to be an expert, I’m not trying to make anyone do anything. It was an interesting article that seemed interesting and related back to the topic. I’m not spreading disinformation or fake news. It’s a small comment on a post about a guy trying to manage his wife’s caloric intake during pregnancy when we call all agree pregnancy is extremely taxing on the body. That’s all I was bringing in.</p>

<p>You know this doesn’t contradict the information you’re trying to claim is pseudoscience at all? It’s still a calories in, calories out. It’s just saying that our bodies quickly adapt to activity levels, so the “calories out” for a given exercise of a person used to physical activity is much lower than the “calories out” of someone just starting to work out.</p>

<div class="md"><p>Yeah, I&#39;d like more information on this if you have it. I have a B.S. in Kinesiology and this was never discussed. But, to make the claim that a high-level athlethe requires the same amount of calories as a stagnant individual seems absurd. I did learn that calories burned varies greatly on your current physical fitness level. I.e. At 6&#39;2 and 200lbs, I will burn less calories than a person at 6&#39;2 and 300lbs during the same routine. This doesn&#39;t mean I&#39;m more efficient, it means they have more spare calories to burn, so they will.</p>

<p>My hiking loop costs me, on average, 2500kcal to hike. That means I need to consume approximately 4250kcal daily to <em>maintain</em> my weight. Were I to have a stagnant lifestyle, I should be consuming 1250-1600kcal to maintain weight. If I were to consume even 2000kcal at my current level, I would see a definite loss of muscle mass and overall weight in general.</p>

<p>Basically, exercise alone doesn&#39;t lose you weight since the body will adjust how it burns calories. Doing extreme exercise will lose you weight, however. Eating less is the key to losing weight.</p>

<div class="md"><p>Here’s the synopsis of the book: One of the foremost researchers in human metabolism reveals surprising new science behind food and exercise. </p>

<p>We burn 2,000 calories a day. And if we exercise and cut carbs, we&#39;ll lose more weight. Right? Wrong. In this paradigm-shifting book, Herman Pontzer reveals for the first time how human metabolism really works so that we can finally manage our weight and improve our health. </p>

<p>Pontzer&#39;s groundbreaking studies with hunter-gatherer tribes show how exercise doesn&#39;t increase our metabolism. Instead, we burn calories within a very narrow range: nearly 3,000 calories per day, no matter our activity level. This was a brilliant evolutionary strategy to survive in times of famine. Now it seems to doom us to obesity. The good news is we can lose weight, but we need to cut calories. Refuting such weight-loss hype as paleo, keto, anti-gluten, anti-grain, and even vegan, Pontzer discusses how all diets succeed or fail: For shedding pounds, a calorie is a calorie. </p>

<p>At the same time, we must exercise to keep our body systems and signals functioning optimally, even if it won&#39;t make us thinner. Hunter-gatherers like the Hadza move about five hours a day and remain remarkably healthy into old age. But elite athletes can push the body too far, burning calories faster than their bodies can take them in. It may be that the most spectacular athletic feats are the result not just of great training, but of an astonishingly efficient digestive system.</p>

<div class="md"><p>So, the synopsis says we burn 3000kcal daily but thias evolutionary strategy has doomed us to obesity? That seems to directly contradict itself.</p>

<p>If hunter-gatherers burn more calories BECAUSE they are pseudo-nomadic, then it stands to reason that exercise burns calories. Which it absolutely does.</p>

<p>Sorry, but I can&#39;t buy into this.</p>

<div class="md"><p>Pregnancy is a mega-expenditure for obvious reasons. I&#39;ve personally helped build exercise prescriptions for pregnant women. </p>

<p>But in terma of pregnancy, there is nothing that you can change in those 9 months that can&#39;t be changed in the following years in relevance to weight gain.</p>

<p>Also, exercising while pregnant has to be approached with great, great caution as it can harm the mother and the fetus. Even when I helped create those ExRx&#39;s, I was helping under the guidance of someone much more qualified than myself. It&#39;s better to be comfortable during pregnancy than fit, but if being fit means being comfortable, then awesomesauce for ya.</p>

<p>But yeah no OP is a major AH. Doubt he has the qualifications to be watching anyones calories, let alone a pregnant female.</p>
