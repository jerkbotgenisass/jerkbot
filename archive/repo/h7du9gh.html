<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I have been carnivor for 60ish days now. I have not been perfect but I am doing my best. I would say I am 97% meat and less than 10 carbs a day. 
The scale keeps going up. I need to lose 50+ lbs. I know weight game can happen in the beginning but I can not find anything that says how long it lasts. I am positive I am not in ketosis. I know this is not a fast thing but I feel like I should be seeing some change by now.</p>

<div class="md"><p>No.... It&#39;s an outdated and neglective belief. One calorie does not equal a calorie from a different source for the body.
As an example, I&#39;ve been eat approx 4000kcal per day during my time with the carnivore diet. I&#39;ve lost 14kg of weight. Previously I ate about 2800kcal kcal every day, and I was gaining weight.</p>

<div class="md"><p>CI/CO has helped millions of people drop body fat. And gain muscle &amp; weight too, for that matter.</p>

<p>When I eat fewer CALORIES, at true deficit, my weight goes down. Regardless of what I&#39;m eating.</p>

<div class="md"><p>There seems to be some confusion here. Ill just say that yes, death camps and POWs have a great diet routine for weight loss, that does not mean it is healthy weight loss. Just understand that CI/CO weight loss is not a health strategy, that con for the pros is always there. Its for maintaining aesthetic on an already unhealthy diet.</p>

<p>Yes, yes it is. Most health markers always improve by dropping fat. Cholesterol, blood pressure, resting heart rate, etc. Until you get too-lean (hormonal suppression), you&#39;re only getting healthier the more fat you drop. You&#39;re adding to the confusion by claiming all CI/CO fat loss is not healthy. We&#39;re not saying &quot;starvation diet&quot;, just modest deficit.</p>

<div class="md"><p>What’s a con of a 250-500 calorie deficit? Please don’t compare what happens in death camps and to POWs to eating in a caloric deficit. It’s a profoundly stupid comparison to make.</p>

<div class="md"><p>Then you have little understanding of the living conditions of the ones that were actually fed anything. Also, no one can determine the correct CI or the correct CO, currently we are all technologically incapable of doing so, even in the best lab setting we can create.</p>

<div class="md"><p>You don’t think I can eat 2500 calories for two weeks, realize I lose two pounds in that time, and understand that my TDEE is 3000? The CI (2500 calories in) gives me the CO (calories out). </p>

<p>It literally can be done with paper, a pencil, and a bathroom scale.</p>
