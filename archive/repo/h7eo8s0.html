<div class="md"><p>But you have given us context:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>A slight calorie surplus is most optimal for muscle gain. Though it is not required and you can build muscle perfectly fine while maintaining or being in a slight deficit. <em>I&#39;ve done it</em> while being lean already, and countless ex-overweight people have done it.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>You think it worked for you, but it seems to have actually held you back if you’ve been doing this longer and your results are no different than what most able-bodied men can do in their first 6ish months of training… or less. </p>

<p>And qualifying your lifts with your bodyweight is a weak mans game. If you want to stay perpetually weak, then stay at 62kg. If you want to actually get big and strong, bulk up and put on some muscle mass. </p>

<p>Regardless, you have nothing to show from your methods aside from invoking “other people” have had success (whatever the fuck that means). You should not be giving training advise at all until you actually try other methods and actually get to the point where people don’t mistake you for a beginner with your lifts.</p>

<div class="md"><p>That has nothing to do with the missing context you needed to not create that verdict out of thin air </p>

<p>I doubt I was held back much. I&#39;ve gained 6kg over the past year, was I supposed to double my bw?  </p>

<p>You were likely born thrice my size or something. You&#39;ve learned to ignore BW so you can compare your lifts to the average to further inflate your ego. I&#39;m not planning to stay 62kg, was I 62kg to begin with? Again, you don&#39;t have the context, you&#39;re pulling shit out of your ass as if you know I&#39;m 62kg bone and started lifting yesterday. You don&#39;t know anything about my body composition, just like how you don&#39;t know the very basic fact that you can build muscle at maintenance</p>

<p>To quote <a href="/u/ZBGBs">/u/ZBGBs</a> “you bench curl weight”</p>

<p>That’s called a bulk. A very slow bulk, but it’s a bulk. Which directly contradicts your initial claim anyways. Regardless, nobody is advocating getting overly fat you overused rectal thermometer! A 250-500 cal daily surplus will not turn a skeleton into a TLC reality show personality. </p>

<p>The only person stroking their ego around here is you. I don’t have to qualify my lifts with my bodyweight just to claim I’m strong “for my weight”. I’m either strong, or I’m not. I currently see myself as the latter, actually.</p>

<div class="md"><p>To quote myself, half of you were born curling double my deadlift and have learned to ignore BW and lost perspective of lifted weight relative to size to fuel that massive ego  </p>

<p>LMFAOOOO, it&#39;s a bulk now is it? Despite what I continuously said about getting leaner and building muscle? Let me spell it out, I started with MOOORE bodyfat. LESS abdominal definition. FEWER visible veins. The only one contradicting anything is you. Now that you&#39;ve learned my original BW, I MUST have been bulking. No, I simply broke the laws of the universe, as I can&#39;t build muscle at or just below maintenance. No strength coaches advocate that <a href="https://youtu.be/QCcP46HWbgw">either</a>.</p>

<p>I never claimed I&#39;m strong. Add to the list of bullshit you&#39;re spewing. I literally called myself intermediate, with my bodyweight as support because guess what, it&#39;s very relevant. Otherwise weight classes wouldn&#39;t exist.</p>

<p>Were you dropped on your head or something? The first law of thermodynamics states that &quot;energy can be <em>changed</em> from one form to another, but it cannot be created or destroyed&quot;. In other words, in order to create a <em>surplus</em> of mass you must introduce an <em>surplus</em> energy source -- calories. You&#39;re the who believes in some magic beans sold to you by a snake charmer that actually defies the laws of physics. </p>

<blockquote>

<p>One. One &quot;coach&quot; advocates that. And he himself bulked and cut to get where he is. That is fact and easily verifiable on <a href="https://OpenPowerlifting.org">OpenPowerlifting.org</a>. Go on. Find Greg and check his bodyweight over time.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I never claimed I&#39;m strong. Add to the list of bullshit you&#39;re spewing. I literally called myself intermediate</p>
</blockquote>

<p>If you&#39;re intermediate by the strength standards site you linked, then I&#39;m &quot;advanced&quot; by the same metric. Which, as I said prior, I do not consider myself to be so. But if that&#39;s the metric we&#39;re going to use, you should STFU.</p>

<p>Weight classes are relevant in competition. Are you competing now?</p>
