<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>To no avail. Unfortunately due to some shitty event I have been eating a lot but anyway I tried getting back on track and have been going to the gym to no avail. What I&#39;m worried about Is that prior to this if I had ever had a cheat day of something, my weight used to go back to normal after a heavy session at thr gym but now I&#39;ve realised that I&#39;ve actually put on visible fat and my weight won&#39;t budge no matter how hard I try and unfortunately this is not water weight. </p>

<p>I got so dejected last night that I indulged again in pancakes and sweets and what not and felt myself upto thr brim. Really really dejected that this is happening at this point and dk what to do tbh. Thought the water weight would come down but it didn&#39;t at all cause it&#39;s not water weight it&#39;s FAT. Fuck</p>
