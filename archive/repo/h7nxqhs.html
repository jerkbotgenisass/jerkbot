<div class="md"><p>correct me if I’m wrong but aren’t these considered “crossfit pullups”. I remember seeing a whole group of women doing pullups like this and it looked hilarious.</p>

<div class="md"><p>Yes it is crossfit and it is full of these dangerous exercises where you can fuck up your joints</p>

<div class="md"><p>Yeah I&#39;m no fitness expert, but rapidly and continually jolting your shoulders, elbows and back with your entire body weight can&#39;t be good.</p>

<p>Are there any actual advantages over just doing pull ups like a normal human, or is it just one of those try-hard idiot things?</p>

<div class="md"><p>The momentum might help you complete more pull-ups and thus feel more satisfied, at least until the pain sets in.</p>

<div class="md"><p>I am a fitness expert and I can tell you that there are no advantages. 
I like to think of pull ups as a survival exercise if you need to pull yourself up the side of a cliff. Obviously, that&#39;s a rare circumstance and general strength and fitness are the common rewards for doing them correctly. That being said, crossfit is dangerous and absolute hell on your joints. If you&#39;re not 20 years old you&#39;ll realize why very quickly.</p>

<div class="md"><p>So basically, this allows people who can&#39;t do &quot;proper&quot; pull-ups to do some sort of pull-up. That&#39;s really all there is to it. It might also be more fun. Outside of fucking up your joints, trying to make that work looks like it might be fun. I mean, obviously you look ridiculous, but idk.</p>

<p>Regular pull-ups are a miserable experience, especially when you struggle to do them, and that&#39;s why this exists. People who can&#39;t do normal ones can be like &quot;oh yeah I can totally do 15 pull-ups.&quot;</p>

<div class="md"><p>The reason people do Kipping is because it utilizes momentum to knock out as many pullups as they can.</p>
