<div class="md"><p>Yeah I&#39;m no fitness expert, but rapidly and continually jolting your shoulders, elbows and back with your entire body weight can&#39;t be good.</p>

<p>Are there any actual advantages over just doing pull ups like a normal human, or is it just one of those try-hard idiot things?</p>

<div class="md"><p>I am a fitness expert and I can tell you that there are no advantages. 
I like to think of pull ups as a survival exercise if you need to pull yourself up the side of a cliff. Obviously, that&#39;s a rare circumstance and general strength and fitness are the common rewards for doing them correctly. That being said, crossfit is dangerous and absolute hell on your joints. If you&#39;re not 20 years old you&#39;ll realize why very quickly.</p>

<div class="md"><p>Hi! Ex-Crossfit coach here!
I agree and disagree with what you&#39;re saying. CrossFit, at a mass level, should not be either dangerous nor hell on your joints. It promotes a general well-being and every exercise it&#39;s scalable if there is a preexistent injury or pain or the client simply can&#39;t do the movement. The bottom line idea of CrossFit is the high intensity, to push yourself always a little bit more. Coaches should be able to identify movements done wrong, encourage the correct technique and discourage increasing intensity or moving to a harder exercise if the client isn&#39;t ready for it. (All this very summed up, I&#39;m at work)</p>

<p>Now, the reality is very different. Coaches are not always prepared to protect the client how they should. I think, most of the times safe movements and progressions get lost in the hype of always pushing yourself more, and that is 100% wrong. Joints are a problem cause as you would know muscles increase their strength much faster than tendons and ligaments and that misleads people to think they can lift more or push themselves more. </p>

<p>That being said, I don&#39;t think that all injuries are for the above reasons, you know as well that many other factors can be involved in an injury even when doing right the movement or being well warmed up.</p>

<p>And lastly, all this doesn&#39;t only apply to CrossFit coaches. I work out in a conventional gym nowadays (in the functional area lol) and honestly, I see about 50% of the people doing something wrong that can lead to an injury and coaches pass by and do or say nothing about it.</p>

<p>I&#39;ll have tos top this cold now, back to work!</p>

<p>Yeah, the bottom line is that is dumb.  It would be dumb for any elite science based training on an elite athlete.  It&#39;s more dumb with average humans.  You haven&#39;t noticed this as a coach that really, it&#39;s not good to always push a little more?  You haven&#39;t noticed that in yourself?  Are you 20 years old and taking steroids?  Because everybody else needs light days, rest days, plateau days.</p>

<p>Kinda hard when official CF doctrine is full of officially dumb movements.  I submit kipping pullups as officially the dumbest.  The &quot;crossfit&quot; swing comes in a close 2nd.</p>

<div class="md"><p>&quot;It&#39;s safe if done entirely correctly&quot; ignores the reality of the situation and crossfit is stupid for that reason still even if you really want to ignore the biodynamics of stuff like kipping pullups.</p>

<p>The fact that the exCEO of crossfit was such a straight up trash human is a fun secondary bonus..</p>
