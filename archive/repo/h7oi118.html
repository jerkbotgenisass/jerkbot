<div class="md"><p>I think there should be weightlifting competitions done with percentages of competitors weight and just combine all the weight classes. Call it a pound for pound competition. For instance, I’m 178lbs and my best bench press is 405lbs, which is 227.5% of my own weight. Compared to that, a 344 lbs competitor like let’s say Hafþór Júlíus Björnsson would have to bench  782.7 lbs to be equivalent.</p>
