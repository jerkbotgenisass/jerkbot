<div class="md"><p>Have there been any further studies on half squats (as opposed to full depth squats) from the point of view of knee injury? The only studies I&#39;ve heard quoted are a couple from over 7 years ago. The studies say half squats are more injury prone than full squats, but Greg Nuckols says to only squat to the depth you can manage, even if it&#39;s just half squat. So, what do if I can&#39;t safely squat to anything below just above parallel?</p>
