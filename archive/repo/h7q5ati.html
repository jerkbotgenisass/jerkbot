Major lifts not progressing for 6 months

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Hi. 33M, 5&#39;10, 161lbs, ~20% BF. Been lifting consistently for 5 years (125 lbs - 161 lbs).</p>

<p>Over the last 6 months, I&#39;ve basically made no progress on my bench or rows. I go to near-failure on most sets, and hit the major muscle groups 3 times a week (full body). I&#39;ve tried adding more volume and accessory lifts. While these extra lifts go up week to week, my main ones do not. I have taken a few deload weeks when needed, so I don&#39;t think it&#39;s under-recovery.</p>

<p>According to an InBody scan, I basically spent last year recomping (dropping ~5 lbs fat and putting on ~3 lbs muscle). (I know InBody scans aren&#39;t necessarily accurate (valid), but they are <em>reliable</em> from a measurement standpoint.) I was 161 in Oct of last year and I am 161 now, in August. This wasn&#39;t necessarily by design. I just didn&#39;t eat enough calories.</p>

<p>Is this a cut and dry case of just needing to eat more if I want to continue to get stronger?</p>
