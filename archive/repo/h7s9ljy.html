<p>Also, do you really think a thumb is going to stop that from happening?</p>

<p>Erm... Yes? Obviously?</p>

<p>He didn&#39;t drop the weight, the weight slipped. If weight is sat on your palms (suicide grip) then it can slip, if your thumb is wrapped around it it&#39;s almost impossible for it to slip unless you purposefully let go/pass out.</p>

<div class="md"><p>Relevant Paragraph </p>

<blockquote>
<p>A thumb simply isn’t going to be strong enough to stop a bar loaded with heavy weight from rolling out of your hands once it’s been set in motion.  Literally ever singly slipped bench I’ve ever seen has been WITH a full grip, and in every instance, it proceeds exactly the same; the trainee is grinding a rep, the wrists inevitably tip upward as the trainee is trying to “push” their hands up, the bar starts it’s roll forward, and then the world ends.  If your thumb can stop a rolling 300+ bar, why aren’t you currently setting the world record on the rolling thunder?  What sort of weird dichotomy is this that a trainee has such a massively strong thumb that it will stop any manner of rolling barbell yet all 4 remaining fingers are so weak that they have zero chance to do the same?  Is this the byproduct of a life spent playing video games?  Massively overdeveloped thumbs and underdeveloped fingers?</p>

<div class="md"><p>That thumb could be the difference between life and death, your thumb might break but at least you’ll see your family again, I don’t understand your dislike for safety, if that guy was able to slow down the bar slamming into his chest even a little he might have survived, there was nothing to slow it down with a thumbless grip. It’s kinda like getting the vaccine for COVID vs being a dumbass</p>

<div class="md"><p>There’s inherent risks in everything. Driving a car is less safe, than bench press. What’s the alternative, sitting in the house wrapped with bubble wrap.</p>

<p>Acceleration due to gravity is still 9.8 m/s<sup>2</sup> with or without a thumb?!</p>
