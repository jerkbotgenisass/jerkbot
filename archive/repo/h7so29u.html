Looking for the best routine to toned up/lose weight

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I’ve been toying with kettlebells for over a year now. I’ve been using it a bit more seriously into the last 6 weeks. I work in the cinema industry (long hours shift) and don’t have a lot of time to workout. I basically workout right after eating my lunch at lunch break.</p>

<p>I’m looking for a good routine where I could lose extra pounds and get more fit.</p>

<p>Right nowmy routine looks like this:
20kg kettlebell 
5x one hand swings
5x cleans
5x press
5x snatch</p>

<p>After each hand is done, it’s one round. I do ten rounds for about 20 to 22 minutes of work with normally 30 seconds of rest in between each rounds. So basically a 100 of each exercises.</p>

<p>This week I’ve add 5x rack squat in between the swing and the cleans ,because I felt like I wasn’t doing enough leg movements, but can’t do them for the whole ten rounds.</p>

<p>I really like TGU but can’t really do it right now because I’m working under a farm shed and the floor is gravel.</p>

<p>I’ve been doing this routine for the last 6 weeks (4 weeks 16kg and 2 weeks 20kg) 4-5 times a week. I feel stronger, feel my muscles a bit more defined but haven’t lost weight really. </p>

<p>My diet isn’t that bad but I do have a hard time keeping track of my calories right now since we have a catering and craft service at work. </p>

<p>Anyway, I’m looking for insights
and advices. Am I on the right track or not?</p>

<div class="md"><p>None of the options you selected are needed for weight loss. The commenter to lose weight simply needs to ensure they are in a calorie deficit. Double-you mentioned a good strategy, the poster can bring their meals to work in order to ensure they know what they are eating, leading to a calorie deficit.</p>

<p>Carbs are totally fine to eat. We should not give people information like this.</p>

<div class="md"><p>Calorie deficit works absolutely but not even close to how good a zero carb diet works.</p>

<p>When you deprive your body of carbs it switches to fat as it’s primary fuel. </p>

<p>The result is low or very low hunger combined with massive energy since your now primary fuel is abundant. </p>

<p>Maybe you also should read up on Carbs, the insulin they spike and what that does for fat retention in the body instead of thought policing others. Idiot.</p>

<div class="md"><p>Great work! All props to your effort. </p>

<p>But I will need to repeat myself since you are dumb.</p>

<p>“Calorie deficit works absolutely but not even close to how good a zero carb diet works.”</p>

<p>Zero carbs uses fat as fuel. Exclusively. </p>

<p>It makes it mathematically impossible to loose more fat -everything else 1:1- than on a zero carb diet.</p>

<p>A zero carb diet also makes it way way waaay easier to be calorie deficient since it makes your hunger cravings go away due to no insulin spikes and thus no Ghrelin (the hormone that makes you want to over-eat)</p>

<p>So yes you could do the stupid thing and go for calorie deficiency only. </p>

<p>But I would recommend anyone who is wishing to loose weight to read up on zero carb, keto and carnivore. </p>

<p>I’f they do read up on it they will understand why it’s a better route to take.</p>

<p>Just because you lost weight the stupid and ineffective way doesn’t mean everyone else needs to do the same.</p>

<p>Facts.</p>

<div class="md"><p>Sounds good. That final comment you made is more of a self-own than a dig at me though. It’s true, just because you lost weight in a stupid and inefficient way doesn’t mean you should push your diet onto others. </p>

<p>Have a good day.</p>
