What's the consensus on coffee?

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>It seems that coffee gets a bit of a pass in the carnivore community. Is there a rationale for this, or people just like it too much to give it up?</p>

<p>I stopped for a few months. No withdrawal or anything and I didn&#39;t knowingly miss it, but when I had a cup one day I felt so much better. I suspect coffee (or tea, the caffeine) simply puts me above baseline. I&#39;d love to have an excuse why this is okay, or at least no big deal. Like one cup a day.</p>

<div class="md"><p>“I’d love to have an excuse” is what I used to say about alcohol, nicotine, and industrially-processed foods. The short answer: it shouldn’t get a pass, but everyone is so addicted they’d rather not talk about it. </p>

<p>Caffeine is a drug like any other. Quit it.</p>

<div class="md"><p>From a general health perspective that&#39;s a defensible argument, but it has nothing to do with the Carnivore Diet protocol. It&#39;s a similar situation to exercise. Does exercise typically improve general health? Yes. Is it a requirement of the Carnivore Diet? No.</p>

<div class="md"><p>Most drugs are made from plants. Coffee is not a food, it&#39;s a drug.</p>

<div class="md"><p>As I said in my reply to your other comment:</p>

<p>&quot;The Carnivore Diet protocol was developed on a forum in the late 2000s of which I was part. The people there decided that coffee, while arguably not optimal, and maybe not even workable for everyone, and certainly not an animal sourced product, was generally tolerated enough and far enough outside of the bounds of food to be considered not off limits as part of the protocol <em>we developed and defined</em>.&quot;</p>

<p>It gets a pass because the community that made the protocol decided it did, in part because of our stance toward food vs drugs. It&#39;s no longer really up for debate. </p>

<p>You don&#39;t have to drink it, and you&#39;re perfectly within your rights to say it doesn&#39;t fit with your notion of what the Carnivore Diet should be (but isn&#39;t).</p>

<div class="md"><p>This isn’t a diet. This way of eating helps people like me become the best humans we can possibly be. Dependence on any drug isn’t natural and caffeine forms a dependency.</p>

<div class="md"><p>It&#39;s a specific protocol that doesn&#39;t happen to exclude coffee. It&#39;s emphatically not a mandate to do everything you think would make humans best, nor an injunction to be &quot;natural&quot;, which isn&#39;t even meaningful. That&#39;s not what the Carnivore Diet is. </p>

<p>Your individual ideas about the evolutionary role, healthfulness, or naturalness of drugs, sexual practices, sleep hygiene, exercise, or whatever are irrelevant to the practice of the Carnivore Diet.</p>
