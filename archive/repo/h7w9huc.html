On MEAT FRIDGES and DIET LETTUCE BOYS!

<div class="post">
<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Today, I will EXPOUND upon several CRITICAL MATTERS that are UNDERMINING the PROGRESS of NOVICE and INTERMEDIATE 
LIFTERS, and in doing so, I will HOLD NOTHING BACK! The TRENDS that I AIM to DISMANTLE have, since their INCEPTION, 
done NOTHING but KEEP YOU MEDIOCRE, and if YOU claim to be a STUDENT of the IRON, you WILL take MY WORDS to HEART! I 
GUARANTEE that upon READING THIS, your MINDSET will NEVER BE THE SAME, your PRs will FOREVER be BOUNTIFUL, and your 
ZEST for LIFE will TRANSFORM into an INSATIABLE APPETITE that will LEAD YOU to ENORMOUS SUCCESS in all DOMAINS of the 
HUMAN EXPERIENCE! It is SAID that the PEN is MIGHTIER than the SWORD, but a PEN in the HANDS of a REFRIGERATOR MADE OF MEAT is a NUCLEAR WARHEAD against DIET LETTUCE BOYS!  </p>

<p><strong>The TWO KINDS of PEOPLE</strong>  </p>

<p>There are ONLY TWO KINDS of PEOPLE in the GYM and in the WORLD: REFRIGERATORS MADE OF MEAT and DIET LETTUCE BOYS! A MEAT FRIDGE is a SPECIMEN of ENORMOUS PHYSICAL STRENGTH and SUFFICIENT WIDTH to BLOCK DOORWAYS, whose very PRESENCE inspires ADMIRATION, AWE, RESPECT, and ENVY from the BEGGAR to the KING alike! These UNITS have an INSATIABLE LOVE for THE IRON and for LIFE, and the GRIT, STRENGTH, and ENDURANCE they have FORGED in the GYM carry them through the TRIALS and TRIBULATIONS of the HUMAN CONDITION, from the INEVITABLE, INVARIABLE TRAGEDIES of this MORTAL COIL to the SETS that would BREAK the BONES and SPIRITS of the UNPREPARED!  </p>

<p>On the other hand, DIET LETTUCE BOYS embody INDECISIVENESS, WEAKNESS, LISTLESSNESS, and IMPOTENCE of MIND, BODY, and SPIRIT! They are EASILY OVERWHELMED and DEFEATED; they QUIT at the SLIGHTEST HINT of ADVERSITY, they make a MOCKERY of the MAN-IRON RELATIONSHIP, and they EMBRACE MEDIOCRITY because EVERYTHING ELSE is TOO STRONG for them to GRASP! They&#39;re SO AFRAID of GAINING MUSCLE and STRENGTH that they WON&#39;T EVEN EAT THE FULL CALORIE LETTUCE, and they have COME to PROLIFERATE the SPACES where LIFTERS GATHER to OPENLY SPEAK about TRAINING only to SHIT UPON EVERY DISCUSSION 
THEY ENTER!  </p>

<p>Now, HOLD ON to your SKULLS, because I am about to BLOW your MINDS WIDE OPEN! EVERY SINGLE THOUGHT and EVERY SINGLE 
ACTION you THINK or PERFORM in the GYM and in LIFE moves you CLOSER towards the EXULTATION of MEAT FRIDGEDOM or the 
TORMENT of DIET LETTUCE BOYHOOD! EVERY SINGLE ONE OF US has the TRAITS that LEND THEMSELVES to the DEVELOPMENT of BOTH EXTREMES, and it is only through WILLFUL, CONSCIOUS CHOICE that we GRAVITATE in a SPECIFIC DIRECTION! NOBODY has EVER become a MEAT FRIDGE ACCIDENTALLY, and NO MATTER HOW DEEPLY you&#39;ve FOUND YOURSELF in a PILE of PALE, LIMP, WILTED GREENS, it is NEVER TOO LATE to CAST OFF EVERY IDEA AND HABIT that KEEP YOU TRAPPED in that COMPOST HEAP of MEDIOCRITY and to BEGIN TO CLAIM the ABSOLUTE ENORMITY OF MIND, BODY, and SPIRIT that has ALWAYS BEEN YOUR BIRTHRIGHT!  </p>

<p><strong>Your INDECISIVENESS is KILLING YOU</strong>  </p>

<p>A POTENT DISEASE is INFECTING LIFTERS of all SHAPES, SIZES, and ABILITIES: It is called &quot;FOMO,&quot; and the first SYMPTOM 
is a BURST of VERBAL DIARRHEA with such questions as &quot;Should I DO LEG CURLS or GHR for my HAMSTRINGS? Should I BULK or 
CUT? Should I EAT half of a CHICKEN BREAST or AN EGG to get my BODYWEIGHT to BUDGE PAST 120 POUNDS?&quot; The SECOND 
symptom is INVARIABLY the SECOND-GUESSING of ANY ADVICE given to these SUFFERERS, followed by the TERROR of the 
PROSPECT of having to SUMMON an OUNCE OF CONVICTION when CHOOSING between TWO REASONABLE OPTIONS, as if the &quot;WRONG&quot; SELECTION will GUARANTEE they will REMAIN FOREVER WEAK AND SMALL! NEWS FLASH: YOU ARE WEAK AND SMALL, and it IS NOT BECAUSE YOU CHOSE to do DONKEY CALF RAISES instead of the ANTERIOR TIBIALIS MACHINE! What HAPPENED to TRYING THINGS and FIGURING out what WORKS and DOESN&#39;T WORK FOR YOU? JUST FUCKING CHOOSE SOMETHING! To those of you STRUGGLING to DECIDE whether a 2-BOARD PRESS or a CLOSE GRIP LARSEN will get your 155 BENCH to 165, I have ONLY the FOLLOWING WORDS: If you CAN&#39;T DECIDE, DON&#39;T! Choose BOTH EXERCISES, and if the NEXT DAY, your ARMS are TOO SORE to LIFT over your HEAD when you&#39;re putting on your TURTLENECK, why don&#39;t you BITCH ABOUT IT to the BARISTA while you ORDER your SKIM SOY LATTE! Sometimes the BEST METHOD for finding YOUR LIMITS is by BLOWING PAST THEM! Heaven FORBID you become ACCOUNTABLE for YOUR EFFORTS! Your 11-INCH ARMS will THANK YOU, as will EVERYONE ELSE who will no longer HAVE TO TOLERATE your INABILITY to be AN ADULT and just FLIP a FUCKING COIN! Guess what: SOMETIMES, you will KNOW EXACTLY WHAT YOU WANT when that COIN is SPINNING IN THE AIR!  </p>

<p><strong>The FEAR of DOING WORK</strong>  </p>

<p>Now, HERE is SOMETHING that REALLY GRINDS MY GEARS! I am SICK and TIRED of all these DASHBOARD CONFESSIONAL BOYS 
asking whether IT&#39;S OK to ADD a SET of LATERAL RAISES TO YOUR PROGRAM! WHY do you feel the NEED to ASK FOR PERMISSION to WORK HARDER? Are you AFRAID that an EXTRA SET of LAT PULLDOWNS will suddenly TRASH your PISS-POOR NERVOUS SYSTEM and OVERTRAIN YOU, causing you to TAKE THREE WEEKS OFF to MANAGE your FATIGUE? Do you ASK if you &quot;SHOULD&quot; or &quot;NEED&quot; to PUSH the PROWLER because you&#39;re SECRETLY TERRIFIED of NOT BEING A DECONDITIONED PIECE OF SHIT who can&#39;t even WALK from the DUMBBELL RACK to the WATER FOUNTAIN without STOPPING to CATCH YOUR BREATH? Let me SPIT some TRUTH directly into your PEA PROTEIN SHAKE! You don&#39;t NEED to do SHIT! You only &quot;NEED&quot; to EAT, DRINK WATER, EXCRETE, and SLEEP! You have CONVENIENTLY FORGOTTEN that BEING IN THE GYM is an ENORMOUS PRIVILEGE! Not a SINGLE LIFTER who CARES ABOUT TRAINING and POSSESSES any SEMBLANCE of SELF-RESPECT will EVER ask such questions! NEXT TIME the URGE to PURSUE MEDIOCRITY manifests itself in a DESIRE to ASK these QUESTIONS, ANSWER YOURSELF IN THE AFFIRMATIVE, and if that&#39;s TOO MUCH FOR YOU, then I suggest a MILDER HOBBY, like HABBO HOTEL!  </p>

<p><strong>&quot;Optimization&quot;</strong>  </p>

<p>Do you KNOW the BEST METHOD for identifying a LIFTER who has NEVER GUTTED OUT a set of 20-REP SQUATS or PUKED in a TRASH CAN from INHUMAN EXERTION, aside from their ATROPHIED QUADS and DELICATE HANDS that have NEVER seen the SHADOW of a CALLUS? If they use the word &quot;OPTIMAL&quot; in a SENTENCE that pertains to TRAINING! I GUARANTEE that a trainee&#39;s desire to &quot;OPTIMIZE&quot; their training is INVERSELY PROPORTIONAL to the amount of EFFORT they&#39;re willing to PUT FORTH and the RESULTS they have ATTAINED! FAR TOO MANY OF YOU are TOO AFRAID to TAKE ACTION until your PREPARATION is PERFECT! In your TWISTED PERCEPTION, you have COME to BELIEVE that TRAINING can be REDUCED to MATHEMATICAL VARIABLES that, when MANIPULATED with the SURGICAL PRECISION of your INTELLECT, DEDUCTIVE REASONING, and ARSENAL of STUDIES will MAGICALLY TRANSFORM YOU into a MUSCULAR COLOSSUS that is the ENVY of your ENTIRE PLANET FITNESS! Unfortunately, despite your &quot;EXTENSIVE RESEARCH&quot; and INTERNET DEBATE, you will INVARIABLY hit MENTAL and PHYSICAL PLATEAUS that can ONLY be BROKEN by, you guessed it, EFFORT! I have NEVER read a SINGLE STUDY that gave me a SICKENING PUMP in my QUADS, nor have I EVER gained a GRAM of MUSCLE by DEBATING whether TEN or TWELVE REPS is the &quot;OPTIMAL&quot; number of REPS for LATERAL RAISES! Henceforth, you are FORBIDDEN to UTTER that WORD until you ATTAIN AT LEAST a 400 WILKS! What&#39;s that? Are you BITCHING that a 400 WILKS will take YEARS of HARD WORK? Isn&#39;t that WHY you are IN THE GYM? The HARD WORK that TERRIFIES YOU will be YOUR GREATEST TEACHER, and once you LEARN its LESSONS, you&#39;ll SUDDENLY FORGET about PERFECTING every ASPECT of YOUR TRAINING! Save the &quot;OPTIMIZATION&quot; for the ELITE LIFTERS who ACTUALLY NEED IT to EKE OUT the last BITS of PROGRESS available to them AFTER A DECADE OR MORE OF TRAINING!  </p>

<p><strong>DISRESPECTING the PRINCIPLES of BODYBUILDING and/or NOT getting STRONG</strong>  </p>

<p>What does a TWELVE-YEAR OLD and a LIFTER who SHITS on the MIND-MUSCLE CONNECTION have IN COMMON? They BOTH have 10-INCH ARMS! Too MANY of these WANNABES have SOMEHOW CONVINCED THEMSELVES that they will get PROFOUNDLY STRONG while MAINTAINING the BODYWEIGHT of a SACK of BEAN SPROUTS, and they will STUDIOUSLY AVOID doing BODYBUILDING-TYPE ASSISTANCE WORK and EATING like THEY MEAN IT because they FEAR LOSING THE PRESTIGE of being the STRONGEST &lt;53KG LIFTER at their LOCAL USAPL MEET that&#39;s being HELD at their LOCAL HIGH SCHOOL! You&#39;re not IMPRESSING ANYONE with your 300 KG TOTAL, even if it was ACCOMPLISHED with SHREDDED ABS! YOU LITERALLY CANNOT BECOME A MEAT FRIDGE without HYPERTROPHY WORK, so it&#39;s TIME to put your DREAMS of BECOMING a HOLLISTER MODEL to REST and actually STARTING TO LOOK LIKE YOU LIFT! I don&#39;t give a SINGLE FLYING SHIT about YOUR ABS, and if THE IDEA of GAINING A FEW PERCENTAGE POINTS of BODYFAT in return for ACHIEVING YOUR MUSCULAR and STRENGTH potential INTIMIDATES YOU too much, then do us all a FAVOR and FUCKING QUIT! Go TALK to the BIGGEST, FREAKIEST MUSCLE MONSTER you KNOW and LEARN the SACRED SECRETS of the ART of BODYBUILDING so that you can FINALLY FILL OUT your MEDIUM T-SHIRT!  </p>

<p>SIMILARLY, if your GOALS align with AESTHETICS, you are doing yourself A GREAT DISSERVICE by REFUSING to TRAIN HEAVY 
at least SOME OF THE TIME! The STRONGER you ARE, the MORE GOOD DAMAGE you can do TO YOUR MUSCLE FIBERS! Back in THE 
DAY when PEOPLE ATE IRON ORE for BREAKFAST and SHAT NAILS, the SQUAT, BENCH, DEADLIFT, PRESS, and ROW were considered FOUNDATIONAL LIFTS to build the BASE for a PHENOMENAL PHYSIQUE, and NONE of the OLD-SCHOOL BODYBUILDERS were CHUMPS at THESE LIFTS! You would do WELL for YOURSELF to LEARN from their EXAMPLE, and THIS WAY, you&#39;ll NEVER have to WORRY about the ENTIRE GYM ROLLING ITS EYES AT YOU when you get STAPLED by a 305 SQUAT despite your BULGING QUADS!  </p>

<p><strong>DEPENDENCE on EXTERNALS</strong>  </p>

<p>Have you EVER seen a LIFTER arrive to the GYM and PROMPTLY EXIT, never to return, because they FORGOT their NEW VIRUS LEGGINGS? Have you ever SEEN a TRAINEE throw in THE TOWEL because they LEFT their HEADPHONES at HOME? Have you HEARD 
someone BITCHING that they MISSED A REP because they didn&#39;t SLAM that FOURTH SCOOP of PREWORKOUT? Let me TELL YOU an 
UNCOMFORTABLE TRUTH: Your WORKOUT would have SUCKED even IN YOUR LEGGINGS, your DEATHCAB FOR CUTIE would have DONE NOTHING to HELP YOU FINALLY ATTAIN that 170 LB FRONT SQUAT, and your PREWORKOUT would have LEFT YOU TRAPPED on the TOILET while your FACE went NUMB! What HAPPENED to just GOING to the FUCKING GYM and LIFTING WEIGHTS? WHEN did it all BECOME some STUPID RITUAL for your THIRTY-SEVEN INSTAGRAM FOLLOWERS? TRUST ME, no one is GIVING YOU SYMPATHY for WRITING that you &quot;WOULD HAVE MADE IT&quot; if you had ONLY GOTTEN more than FIVE HOURS OF SLEEP! You&#39;re getting ZERO EXTRA CREDIT POINTS for EVERY EXCUSE that you can MUSTER UP! If EXCUSES built TOTALS, I would be BITCHING instead of LIFTING WEIGHTS! I happen to KNOW a GUY who OWNS TEN PAIRS OF WEIGHTLIFTING SHOES but gets STAPLED by a 150 KG SQUAT on a REGULAR BASIS after FIVE YEARS OF LIFTING! Do you even UNDERSTAND how MANY THINGS have to GO WRONG for SOMEONE to REACH such a CONDITION? If you RELATE to this, PLEASE ask yourself IF YOU&#39;VE FOUND YOURSELF IN THE WRONG PURSUIT, because THE LAST THING I WANT is for ANYONE who doesn&#39;t, IN THEIR HEART OF HEARTS, WANT to LIFT WEIGHTS to BE LIFTING WEIGHTS! If you SUCK and you WANT to NOT SUCK, ACCEPT THAT YOU SUCK, EMBRACE IT, and FUCKING DO SOMETHING ABOUT IT instead of TRYING to MASK your INEPTITUDE with CLOTHES, ACCESSORIES, and SUPPLEMENTS! HINT: That which WILL HELP YOU will be DIFFICULT, EFFORTFUL, and OFTEN UNPLEASANT, which is WHY YOU HAVE AVOIDED IT AND CONTINUE TO SUCK!  </p>

<p><strong>Your SHITTY OPINIONS DON&#39;T MATTER</strong>  </p>

<p>I cannot BELIEVE that I HAVE TO WRITE ABOUT THIS, but the ADVENT of the INTERNET has given FAR TOO MANY people who 
have NOTHING TO CONTRIBUTE to a DISCUSSION about TRAINING the PLATFORM and the ANONYMITY required to DISSEMINATE their SHITTY OPINIONS! It&#39;s as if they BELIVE that HAVING an OPINION NECESSITATES its SHARING! You all know EXACTLY what I&#39;m TALKING ABOUT! They are the PEOPLE who will COMMENT on a FEMALE LIFTER&#39;S KNEES slightly CAVING in the HOLE of a SQUAT DESPITE the FACT that SHE IS SQUATTING THREE TIMES THEIR MAX! They will ATTEMPT to &quot;DISCREDIT&quot; a BENCH because the ARCH is &quot;TOO BIG,&quot; a SQUAT because it ISN&#39;T DROPPED to their DESIRED DEPTH, a PHYSIQUE because it was ASSISTED by STEROIDS, and virtually ANY OTHER LIFT because the &quot;TECHNIQUE&quot; wasn&#39;t UP TO PAR! NONE of these KEYBOARD ASSASSINS have ANY ACCOMPLISHMENTS to SPEAK OF, so they VALIDATE their MEDIOCRITY by TRYING THEIR UTMOST to BRING EVERYONE DOWN to their SHITTY LEVEL! To these, I have ONLY ONE THING TO SAY: MEAT FRIDGES DO NOT CONCERN THEMSELVES WITH THE OPINIONS OF DIET LETTUCE BOYS! SIMILARLY, if you are A BEGINNER, STOP GIVING ADVICE! I UNDERSTAND that YOUR INTENTIONS are GOOD and I ADMIRE your GOODWILL, but without REQUISITE EXPERIENCE, you are FAR MORE LIKELY to MISLEAD your FELLOW LIFTERS than to OFFER GUIDANCE of VALUE! Let the SEASONED LIFTERS take THE LEAD, keep your MINDS OPEN, LEARN, and ASK GOOD QUESTIONS! EVERYONE will TAKE NOTE of YOUR CONDUCT, and your BRAIN will SOON BE BRIMMING with KNOWLEDGE and EXPERIENCE!  </p>

<p><strong>I CARE ABOUT YOU</strong>  </p>

<p>MY FRIENDS, I have SCREAMED until MY THROAT resembles RAW HAMBURGER, and I have SAID what I HAD TO SAY! NONE of this 
was WRITTEN for ANY REASON other than YOUR BENEFIT, and if you have TAKEN OFFENSE, then REMEMBER that EVERY SINGLE 
LIFTER DESERVES to BECOME a REFRIGERATOR MADE OF MEAT! It IS, after all, YOUR BIRTHRIGHT! Your FEELINGS of OFFENSE 
are A SIGN of your DISCONTENTMENT with your SITUATION, so TREAT THEM as a CALL to ACTION! Should you FIND YOURSELF 
relating ALL TOO WELL to the DIET LETTUCE BOYS, I CALL UPON YOU to TAKE RESPONSIBILITY, to ESCHEW the BULLSHIT you have FED YOURSELF and LAPPED UP from the EAGER HANDS of THOSE whose LIVELIHOODS, IDENTITIES, and PURPOSES are GROUNDED 
in KEEPING YOU MEDIOCRE, CONFUSED, and DEPRESSED, and to CLAIM what is WITHIN REACH for EVERY LIFTER that has EVER set FOOT in A GYM! In EVERY DIET LETTUCE BOY there is a MEAT FRIDGE WAITING TO BURST FORTH, and he will REMAIN ALIVE and HUNGRY until THE DAY you FOREVER hang YOUR WRIST WRAPS on a CROOKED, RUSTY NAIL in YOUR GARAGE! BELIEVE IN YOURSELF LIKE I BELIEVE IN YOU, and I CANNOT WAIT to MEET EACH and EVERY ONE OF YOU at THE END OF ALL THINGS IN THE HALLOWED HALLS OF THE GREAT GYM IN THE SKY WHERE THE IRON SINGS OF GLORY PAST AND PRESENT SO THAT WE MAY LOCK OUR 21 INCH BICEPS TOGETHER, LOOK EACH OTHER IN THE EYE, AND SAY, &quot;BROTHER...WE&#39;VE MADE IT!!!!!!!!!!&quot;</p>

<div class="md"><p>I&#39;ve been tinkering a template of my own, which btw doesn&#39;t mean I&#39;m not lifting until it&#39;s finished.. and maybe it&#39;s the scientist in me, but there are more and less optimum ways to train with variables like weekly sets, number of rest days, lean bulking, periodization/split strategies, joint strain per exercise, RER targets etc. I finally finished my template that balances out different aspects of Mike Israetel and Greg Nuckols templates/lectures that I believe is optimum for me. I get that &quot;stop overthinking, lift heavy, eat a lot&quot; is peace of mind. But I&#39;ve had quite a few friends reach out on social media asking for advice after seeing my progress, because they&#39;re not progressing even though they think they&#39;re eating and lifting enough. Nerding out and splitting hairs with over optimization might be necessary for some like myself to ensure progress is made while the &quot;lift heavy and eat protein&quot; approach may work for some while causing others to waste years thinking they&#39;ll make gains...eventually</p>
