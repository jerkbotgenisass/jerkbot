<div class="md"><p>I&#39;m gonna be brutally honest here... There are a zillion rash guards that are less revealing. Just Google any fight on YouTube with say Grace Gundrum, Mesquita, Ffion Davis, Liz Clay and lots of other awesome bjj female fighters.</p>

<p>Some want to fight. Some want to show off for insta followers, onlyfans, and advertising revenue. Bjj doesn&#39;t pay that much as a professional fighter. Nobody is &quot;sexualising&quot; her. She&#39;s intentionally sexualising herself...</p>

<p>If you want to see the other end of the spectrum from the names I mentioned above have a look at Gordon Ryan&#39;s girlfriend&#39;s insta (she competing at purple I think.) Something Sony something I think... I&#39;m sure someone here will know...</p>

<div class="md"><p>You&#39;re definitely wrong. She&#39;s has a blackbelt. A BJJ blackbelt is tough as fuck and likely spent more than a decade to achieve that goal. Just because she has boobs and chooses to wear a sports bra means nothing...unless you attach a nonsense view like this to it. </p>

<p>What about dudes who are jacked that don&#39;t wear rashguards under the gi? There is plenty of the in BJJ. Are they sexuailizing themselves?</p>

<div class="md"><p>I’m not saying she’s not confident or doesn’t appreciate how she looks. I’m saying that in the context of this being posted on this subreddit and implicit (hell, even explicit if u read some comments here) desire of some to see the end result of her sports bra revealing more than what it’s covering is sexualising a fighter wearing what is otherwise a completely acceptable replacement top for a rashguard. I mentioned it above, that rashguard or bra top — they’re both acceptable clothing for exercising in other sports, wearing one or the other does not change the level of sexualisation or expectation we can bring as viewers looking at a women. Hell, my sister train at the same as I do, if I knew that my guy friends at my gym pin an expectation level of how much they can sexualise her based on whether she wears a sports bra or fucking hoodie to class that day, I wouldn’t be best pleased.</p>

<div class="md"><p>First of all, thank you for a well written comment, rather than a &quot;all men bad&quot; fest.</p>

<p>As you know, in the same way than some women and very modest while others want to monetise their bodies through OnlyFans, men have a range too. There are normal men and there are absolute pervy creepy pigs. As you say...look at the comments here...some are literally &quot;ooooh...boobies&quot;.</p>

<p>My take is, I can&#39;t change the world. I can campaign and push towards the right direction but change won&#39;t happen overnight. So, in the meantime, since I can&#39;t control what others will say and do, I can control what I do...what I wear...what I say...etc.</p>

<div class="md"><p>There&#39;s also other reasons she might&#39;ve chosen what to wear such as more breathability. Not every woman who works out in a gym with a sports bra is trying to gain new followers. Also, just because someone might have a side venture such as Instagram with sponsored posts doesn&#39;t automatically mean they&#39;re wanting to be sexualized. If you actually look at her <a href="https://instagram.com/mayssabastos?utm_medium=copy_link">instagram</a> (which the commenter you replied to shared in an edit) its nothing like the profile you gave as an example. </p>

<p>She&#39;s a multiple world champion in her sport and it seems disrespectful to automatically assume the motive behind her choice was appearance over comfort and performance. Also seems disingenuous to then link an Instagram that very clearly uses the sellability of sex and sexy poses.</p>

You can see the sleeve grips here as she is playing spider guard. Just look up any bjj gi competition on YouTube... Refs literally pause the fight sometimes so you can tidy yourself up, redo your belt, etc. </p>

<p>She loves the way she looks, she&#39;s confident, she likes to show it and there&#39;s nothing wrong with that. There&#39;s no harassment here...mostly admiration as she&#39;s an absolute killer in the gi and has won shed loads of competitions at black belt level (the highest level).

<p>They do have boobs. Showing boobs for whatever reason does not mean they are sexualizing themselves. This is not for us to decide because we do not even remotely have the own experiences with all of this to say something like this.</p>

<div class="md"><p>Not saying that you had stated that she’s monetising her sexuality. I’m stating that she as a matter of fact, is not intentionally sexualising herself because she doesn’t promote her onlyfans (even if she does have one, which I doubt she does) and her ig is not one that look like sonny’s. So it’s not fair to argue that there lies a possibility she’s purposely wearing revealing clothes to gain a following or something like that. (But hey, I’m not looking to stir a debate today, both adults here, we can agree to disagree and save the comment war to keyboard warriors.)</p>

<div class="md"><p>Alright let’s assume some do so than parts of what your saying would likely be okay but the Instagram profile does not belong to her.

<div class="md"><p>Im a dude here, but as a brother w sisters, I totally agree. A sports bra is a completely normal exercise outfit, it’s not fair to say she <em>chose</em> to sexualise herself by wearing one when it’s a good and acceptable replacement to a sports top.

<div class="md"><p>They aren&#39;t sexualizing a fighter. They&#39;re sexualizing cleavage.</p>

<p>It sounds reasonable to say &quot;I can&#39;t believe you would sexualize an athlete&quot; until you understand some nations force their volleyball players to wear certain &quot;uniforms&quot;.</p>

<p>Also, there is nothing wrong with being sexualized. That does not = objectification. I can appreciate Ronaldo&#39;s immense talent and value him as an athlete, while at the same time appreciating his philanthropic work, while at the same time thinking he is a damned fine piece of ass.</p>

<p>Also, you don&#39;t know SHIT about what this person wants. MANY athletes enjoy being sexual objects. It&#39;s not a pejorative. It&#39;s not a weakness.

<p>No I haven&#39;t lol? Sexualizing her in the middle of a match because she has cleavage is harassment. &#39;Appreciating the human form&#39; is an extremely weird way to phrase sexualizing someone. Also I never said they&#39;re veiwed as objects, you&#39;re literally the one who said earlier &quot;<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/maybemaybemaybe/comments/oz1o53/maybe_maybe_maybe/h7yfuj4/">MANY athletes enjoy being sexual objects</a>,&quot; do you have a fucking brain lmao? Or can you not remember what you wrote an hour ago? In no way is my world view &#39;archaic&#39; by saying people are sexualizing this.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>When is it ok to think the human form is sexy? under what circumstances? Is it ok to think an actor in a movie is sexy? How about someone walking down the street? Why or why not?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Again, there&#39;s a difference between someone doing their job and posting it here because their cleavage is out and someone who clearly tries to be sexual with themselves and their career. Her instagram has no posts like any of the other ones you&#39;re claiming do.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>Explain how I don&#39;t apply my &#39;values&#39; consistently? I&#39;m never saying I haven&#39;t &#39;appreciated the human form as sexy,&#39; I just don&#39;t post it on reddit and in public and keep to myself instead of being a weird fuck like you lol.</p>

<div class="md"><p>Her boobs are hanging out...what do you want from me? I&#39;m a human being. Why are you shaming guys for having primal, biological instincts? You may not be into chicks. That&#39;s cool. But a lot of guys are, and it&#39;s concerning to see a trend of men hating men for being men. </p>

<p>In 2021, it seems like the general sentiment is to be your authentic self, be open and honest about who you are and what you like and don&#39;t be afraid to embrace your sexuality....unless you&#39;re a straight guy I guess? In which case you should be ashamed of your sexuality and feel bad about having sexual feelings — you&#39;re not to share or make your preferences publicly known in any way.</p>

<div class="md"><p>I know you&#39;re not supposed to blame the victim, but she is not a victim, she deliberately wore that. I watched a lot of combat events during this Olympics, and none of them revealed that much, even though a lot of them had their (gi?) pulled open like that</p>

<div class="md"><p>So you&#39;re an expert now? Have you ever worn a gi? Every bit of area that you can keep from doubling layers by wearing something smaller underneath makes a difference. Dudes don&#39;t wear anything underneath their gi. Is that too sexy for you?</p>

<div class="md"><p>I am not an expert, just saying I&#39;ve watched dozens of matches during these games and did not see any boobs hanging out. She chose her underwear because her boobs  would get on TV and NO OTHER REASON!
She objectified herself.</p>

<div class="md"><p>Outside of jiujitsu, many female athletes wear sports bras and leggings — and taken as completely acceptable replacement top for a normal top. What she chose to wear for comfort is not reason to justify that she chose to be sexualised.</p>
