Should I start taking creatine?

<div class="md"><p>To get enough creatine from natural sources he’d need to eat a kilo of red meat to get 5g. I don’t think that’s feasible for most people. </p>

<p>I never said training and diet aren’t important, obviously they’re more important than a supplement that has minimal benefit (I’ve already stated that), but if he wants to take creatine there’s nothing wrong with that. Why does being untrained mean creatine would be a waste?</p>

<p>If putting a scoop of creatine in a cup of water is overcomplicated to you I do not think you should be offering advice on training or diet. What have you achieved to make your opinion valid?</p>

<p>It&#39;s literally my job to train teenagers for sport specific performance</p>

<div class="md"><p>Oh nice! What sport/sports? </p>

<p>I’m still waiting on when you think people should start taking creatine, and what part of being a new trainee makes it ineffective or a waste to take. Again, I’m not saying it’s anywhere close to the most important thing. Diet and programming are by far more important, but I’m curious what your reasoning is behind being so strongly opposed to someone taking a safe supplement with proven benefits.</p>

<p>Baseball, track, wrestling, football for the kids, and I separately coach strongman. </p>

<p>Usually past 2 years, unless they have an established athletic background coming in, then it&#39;s case by case. I&#39;ll say I&#39;ve recommended creatine to at least 15 of my current 20 or so kids - most on varsity teams with a competition history going back into middle school, and a demonstrated control over specific muscle engagement.</p>

<div class="md"><p>What are your best events in strongman? Numbers? Waiting until someone has been training for two years to take something like creatine seems like a joke.</p>

<p>What effect does someone’s muscle engagement have on creatine? Why is that relevant?</p>
