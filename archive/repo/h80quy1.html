	<title>I left my gym in 2018 because I had to move for college in a place that didn't have a gym nearby. Back then, the most I could deadlift in one rep was 47kgs(103.6lbs) I joined a gym two months ago And two months later this the most I have lifted so far which is a 100kgs(220.5lbs)</title>

<div class="md"><p>I know I’m going to catch hell, but deadlift is a shit lift anyway!  I’m not a cross fit guy and never will be, but I understand what they’re saying. It’s not a functional lift. There is 0% of you that becomes more athletic or healthier from doing it. Just my opinion. Don’t hate.</p>
