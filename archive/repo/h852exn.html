<div class="md"><p>steroids aren&#39;t magic, he still needed to (at bare minimum) eat enough and work out with enough intensity </p>

<p>this isn&#39;t a steroid physique but most people who do steroids also don&#39;t look like they are on steroids so that&#39;s meaningless, but it&#39;s almost impossible to tell until its obvious someone is past their natty limit. But most people don&#39;t even hit their natty limit even after doing steroids.</p>

<div class="md"><p>Achievable with a half good Diet, most people who use just use it to eat a little more and not get too fat while also getting big and having more fun at the gym</p>

<p>Most people think using roids means you&#39;re looking like fucking Knut, but his physique is impressive in it&#39;s own right, train in that pic looks like your average steroid user that&#39;s not eating broccoli and rice straight from the fridge</p>

<p>And that&#39;s absolutely fucking retarded no matter how you put it</p>

<div class="md"><p>they are cheat codes. Obviously you still need to workout an extreme amount, you dont just take steroids and magically get muscles. But if one person is all natural on the same exact diet and workout routine as someone on steroids, the person on steroids will see bigger gains. The steroids allow you to workout and make gains beyond your natural limit - therefore its a cheat code. (thats why they test for this stuff in sports) Though if someone sat on their ass and thought they were gonna get big from roids alone then they&#39;re just a fucking moron.</p>

<div class="md"><p>There&#39;s a reason cows are muscle monsters even though they just stand there all day. Different chemicals in their body.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t do anything really in terms of workout and I am way stronger than 99% of women that don&#39;t work out. Because I have a Y-chromosome and therefore different proteins in my body.</p>

<p>Steroids are the closest thing to a cheat code there is for muscle gains.</p>

<div class="md"><p>But what about the genetics of the individuals? Or the workout program they did, or if they were beginner lifters or not. They could have gotten people who already work out to test against people who never workout to do whatever steroids they had them take. Also the sample size was probably like 500 people. &quot;copium haha&quot;</p>

<div class="md"><p>What are you smoking steroids literally are magic. You can work out each bodypart once a week and eat whatever you want. Your lifts go up significantly basically immediately after shooting test. Obviously theres a cost, but I think I saw a study that says its like 7 times easier to build muscle with steroids, and that someone doing steroids without lifting will gain more muscle than someone clean eating healthy and lifting, which tracks with my experiences</p>

<div class="md"><p>What he means is that if you take steroids but lift mediocre amounts, your gains will be mediocre too. Steroids allow you to work out more. If you don&#39;t work out more, then you&#39;re just wasting  it.</p>

<div class="md"><p>Steroids pretty much are magic. I’ve seen studies where people who take a decent level of test and do 0 exercise end up gaining more muscle than natural people following a regular training split.</p>

<p>By training and being on top of your nutrition WITH steroids you can go much further… but steroids aren’t something that will be no effect if you just sit there</p>
