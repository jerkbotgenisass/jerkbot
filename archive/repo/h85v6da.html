<div class="md"><p>I noticed a couple of things:</p>

<p>Your feet are pointing outwards rather than forwards. It might make it difficult to apply power fully. It looks like it&#39;s making your knees point outwards too.</p>

<p>Are you lifting in socks? That might not matter so much on some gym surfaces, but on wooden lifting platforms it could be a bit slippery. It might limit your connection with the ground and ability to drive securely through your feet.</p>

<p>You seem to struggle towards the top of the lift when you should be driving your hips through. You could probably work some partials or band deadlifts to help with this.</p>
