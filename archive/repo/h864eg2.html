Seeing my dad go down a bad rabbit hole.

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Hello, my dad is an actor in Mexico and as a result, been taking his workouts and training more seriously. His trainer and others are at the gym are recommending to him crazy expensive supplements. Right now his most expensive is a $300 testosterone booster which I know is a scam. </p>

<p>I have a feeling that he doesn’t realize that the movie star physique is extremely hard to achieve at his age (51) without taking PED’s. His diet isn’t too extreme quite yet but I do see him being extremely disappointed in himself because he really does believe that all movie stars gain their muscles naturally. </p>

<p>I’m kinda scared for him to be introduced to them and think of them as magical. I don’t know how to approach him about it. So I want to ask, what encouraged you guys to get fit without drugs. I wanna maybe see if I can make a case for it and stave off this path I’m seeing him go down.</p>

<p>They cover realistic body goals, fake supplements and PEDs constantly.</p>

<div class="md"><p>The fact that you call someone a charlatan tells me all I need to know. </p>

<p>I honestly think it&#39;s adorable that <strong>you</strong>, some random achievement-less fuck on reddit, thinks they are in a place to call a former professional bodybuilder and decorated coach (Greg Doucette) &amp; someone who owns their own TRT clinic and supplement line (Derek), a &#39;charlatan&#39;.</p>

<div class="md"><p>Maybe he called Greg a charlatan because he sells cookie cutter programs for hundreds of dollars that he hires people for peanuts to write.</p>

<p>Don&#39;t know enough about Derek to make an assessment.</p>

<div class="md"><p>What a trash argument. He sells something therefore he&#39;s a charlatan? Oh he outsources it? Welcome to 2021, it&#39;s called being an efficient business person. </p>

<p>He couldn&#39;t charge hundreds if people weren&#39;t paying for it. Just because you can&#39;t afford it doesn&#39;t make it shady</p>

<p>No, he sells something you can find <em>very</em> easily for free, advertises it as being &quot;custom-made,&quot; and then charges $400+ for it.</p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>If I took my car to a mechanic expecting him to do the work, and then he sends the car to some other shop for them to do it, I wouldn&#39;t be very happy. I would have no way of knowing if the other shop does good work.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>Whether or not I could afford it is irrelevant. His programs are not worth $400, and the only reason he makes money off of it is because he has a massive cult following. When people worship you the way his fans do, then yeah, they&#39;re gonna shell out hundreds of dollars because they think you&#39;re God.</p>

<p>Greg is easily one of the lowest tiers of online fitness content. Better options: Stronger By Science, EliteFTS, Renaissance Periodization, Juggernaut Training Systems, Calgary Barbell, TSA, and the list goes on. These people put out incredibly high-quality, research-based  content absolutely free. Many of them have not only decades of experience as competitors but also Master&#39;s degrees and PhD&#39;s. I&#39;m not knocking Greg&#39;s achievements, but he&#39;s one guy in a sea of other high-achieving fitness guys and a lot of what he says simply isn&#39;t based in reality (ex. the moronic concept of &#39;maingaining&#39;).</p>
