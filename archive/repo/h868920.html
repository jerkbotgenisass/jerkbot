<div class="md"><p>Brahs, what do? </p>

<blockquote>
<p>pretty strong guy, powerlift for a few years now. Been having my lower back get so sore after rdls or deads that I literally can’t bend or walk (I’m 24). Squat 415 no belt for reps no problem, but whenever it comes to lower back intensive exercises it just tenses up really bad. Massages bi-weekly help but not much. Any time my lower back gets ultra tense during a workout I just hang for a few minutes and stretch my spine, makes the pain go away completely. I’m not sure what it is? If anyone has any ideas? </p>
</blockquote>

<p>And before the stretching advice - I’m able to do splits and I’m generally really flexible, so my lower back issues aren’t flexibility related.</p>
