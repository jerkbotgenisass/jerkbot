What is the absolute muscular potential for women naturally?

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I’m a female amateur boxer who has just started powerlifting and have got a bit confused looking at this sub and women into fitness in general.</p>

<p>So I know especially in powerlifting the women must have a decent  amount of muscle to lift that amount of weight, but they won’t be shredded or lean. When you see some elite cross-fitters, they are most likely taking steroids to increase their performance and be lean with a ton of muscle. </p>

<p>I’m wanting to gain some muscle and lose fat and wondering what to expect after years of training naturally as a female, what would be my so called limit?</p>

<p>If testosterone is the only thing important to build muscle women should have no muscle potential at all yet many women have a decent amount of natural muscle, so I guess stuff like HGH must be important for women</p>

<p>Any women here that can weigh in or anecdotal stories from guys who know women who have naturally gained?</p>

<div class="md"><p>I did a few different things, starting with. GZCL (free, customizable) and Barbell Medicine&#39;s powerbuilding program (paid, but lays out exactly what you need to do). The BBM stuff was RPE based, which some people like and some hate, but my lifts just kept going up and up. </p>

<p>My first year of serious focused lifting was 2 months SL, maybe 2 months gzcl while training for a half marathon, BBM for most of the rest. </p>

<p>Starting numbers for that year were something like 115 squat, 80 bench, 150 deadlift. Ended with a meet where I did a 209 squat, 138 bench, 275 dl at bodyweight around 135.</p>

<div class="md"><p>Not sure why you&#39;re being so dismissive and rude, you&#39;ve actually gone so negative you somehow failed to comprehend what the person you&#39;re defending posted as we never disagreed with each other.</p>

<p>They are commenting on breaking strength standards, I am commenting about a starter lifting program, completely different.</p>

<p>Also I never said it was a rule, but if I told you, you could earn $1000 a day or $1000 a week which would you prefer? Same concept with muscle gain/increasing numbers when comparing LP to a periodization program.</p>

<p>In fact....guess who also did LP as a starter program as clearly written in there post... the person you&#39;re referring to.</p>

<p>You&#39;re going to learn a lot more in this life if you start looking at the content of information and assessing it objectively instead of saying &quot;THIS PERSONS RIGHT NO NEED TO THINK FOR MYSELF ANYONE WHO DISAGREES IS STUPID&quot;</p>

<p>Also not to disparage her, but the aforementioned numbers are far from accomplished.</p>

<p>Makes more sense :P </p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>Would the universal advantage not be gaining strength and size faster? </p>

<p>Curious on the counter argument here because unless I am mistaken saying its not faster would be arguing greater stressors does not equal greater adaptation.</p>

<p>Not sure where this rule stuff came from, the Gestapo doesn&#39;t come and take your weights away if you don&#39;t start with LP.</p>

<p>You&#39;re assuming that there&#39;s a 1:1 relationship between the working weights prescribed by a program and the adaptations that the lifter&#39;s body undergoes. There&#39;s a <em>range</em> of stressors that can lead to adaptation, not just one specific number. For example, you don&#39;t stagnate if you squat the same working weight a few weeks in a row; if 100 pounds was effective last week it&#39;s still good for you this week. On a non-LP, soon enough your program will prescribe a bigger jump, or you&#39;ll retest your maxes, or your program will adjust based on how many reps you got on an AMRAP. There are many possible program designs that provide appropriate stressors for a beginning lifter, and an LP is only one of them.</p>

<p>If you&#39;d like to learn more, there are tons of resources out there about programming, and some specifically about the pros and cons of popular LP&#39;s. Two classics of the genre are <a href="https://thefitness.wiki/faq/starting-strength-and-stronglifts-not-recommended/">this</a> and <a href="https://www.strongerbyscience.com/making-your-novice-strength-training-routine-more-effective-two-quick-tips/">this</a>. </p>

<p>FWIW, when my son became interested in lifting--and being young and previously untrained he is the <em>classic</em> perfect candidate for an LP--I had him do a version of 5/3/1 For Beginners and then moved on to other 5/3/1 templates. All work on a three-week cycle and are not LPs. He is progressing probably as quickly as he would have on an LP, but getting a broader base to build on with more accessories, more volume, and more variation in rep ranges.</p>

<div class="md"><p>How is he progressing probably as quickly when its 3x slower if you follow the prescribed program?</p>

<p>GZCLP, pretty similar accessory volume, LP does not mean cookie cutter SL/SS which anyone with experience knows is subpar, they weren&#39;t designed for purely lifting, one is a advertising product the other is for high school athletes in the off-season.</p>

<p>Educate me don&#39;t belittle me.</p>

<div class="md"><p>You have no clue who I am or what my experience is, based on the original content I posted you decided I was less experienced and male and for some inane reason my perceived gender and skill level means I can&#39;t understand very basic biology.</p>

<p>It&#39;s pretty simple if one program adds 10lbs every 3 weeks and one adds it every week, the latter is faster, my perceived experience or gender has no bearing on how those numbers add together and saying it does is pure condescension and I find it extremely hard to believe you don&#39;t know exactly what cadence your message emits.</p>

<p>This is a very well documented cognitive bias called the Halo effect, being accomplished and female makes you like this person, therefore you give greater weight to everything they say or do.</p>

<p>They want to talk about peaking as a female which they did, I will bow down to the experience and gender all day long and not comment because I don&#39;t know, but in terms of what makes a bigger number 10x3 or 10x1, I am just as qualified as her.</p>

<p>Then you felt the need to tag on “yah but lp tho” </p>

<p>Then I said I don’t think your comment was necessary you took it hella personally. </p>

<p>So why should I give a shit about your opinion? It’s not like you offered up qualifications. Frankly not assuming someone who doesn’t provide qualifications is full of shit is foolish on Reddit.
