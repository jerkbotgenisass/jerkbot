<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Hello fellow humans, I too am a human.</p>

<p>This is deer meat sold cheap as pet food.  I’m looking to buy deer or kangaroo meat in bulk, and this is a cheap price.</p>

<p>My Japanese friends reckon that it’s just not a really tasty cut but is fine to eat.  I’m more worried about buying “meat” and getting a 5.5kg box of tendons.</p>

<p>I don’t think it’s going to be rotten or contaminated with some kind of drug/poison Bc they couldn’t sell that as pet food right?</p>

<div class="md"><p>WHY? Are you trying to save money on groceries? I am not gonna explain the potential dangers, others here have done that. I am just saying it is a stupid idea. Don&#39;t do it. If you need money, ask for it. I&#39;m sure your friends would help you get some real groceries, rather than see you risk your health by consuming garbage.</p>

<div class="md"><p>I mean, I make enough money to live, but going towards a competition in March there’s a lot of costs involved.  I’ll probably spend several 10万円 on different things involved so I want to cut costs where possible.</p>

<p>My coach is asking me to find the leanest red meat I can for one 220g meal a day.  The other meats are fish and chicken which I get at gyomu-super.   Lean beef is fine but it’s stupidly hard to find.  Horse and kangaroo would be fine too.  The Meat Guy can’t seem to keep stock anymore and is too unreliable now to depend on.</p>

<div class="md"><p>Egg white, yogurt, lentils… lots of better options than pet food!</p>

<div class="md"><p>I’m not even going to argue with this.  You simply can’t pick random foods to do a contest prep on.  Those foods are fine, but there is a place for red meat, which is why I have it in 1 meal.</p>

<div class="md"><p>I mean, he was #10 in the world. </p>

<p>I think I’m generally in pretty good shape.
Let’s compare pics and if you’re in better shape than me I’ll hire you as my coach. </p>

<p>You can criticize me for eating dog food, that’s fine I don’t give a shit.  But don’t slam a world famous coach for telling me to eat 1 meal of lean red meat a day, that’s stupid.</p>

<p>Edit:
Also, egg whites aren’t even cheap.  They’re one of the more expensive foods in my diet.</p>

<div class="md"><p>I&#39;m sorry, IDK who you are and IDK who your coach is. You asked a question,,,I replied. Go ahead and eat garbage I don&#39;t give a shit. You can&#39;t afford to hire me as a coach, you can&#39;t even afford to eat human food. I have to go eat dinner now, Shrimp cocktail followed by a nice rib-eye steak,Coconut cream pie for desert. Enjoy your Alpo.</p>
