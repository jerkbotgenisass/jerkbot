<p>Nah, a good program with a reasonably progression and it&#39;s not worse than any other exercise. It gets a bad rap because people get fatigued lower backs and they think it&#39;s an injury. It&#39;s not more injury prone than any other exercise.</p>

<div class="md"><p>Definitely can get rid of deadlifts if your goal is aesthetics. Deadlifts hit a lot of muscles, but they don&#39;t hit any one muscle particularly well.</p>

<div class="md"><p>Because deadlifts work so many muscles, there is always going to be a limiting factor. If your grip is weak, you&#39;re basically doing a grip exercise. You&#39;re much better doing Romanian deadlifts if you&#39;re looking to work glutes or hamstrings.</p>

<div class="md"><p>If my grip is a factor, I can use straps.  While an RDL or SLDL can target a muscle more directly, you are also lifting less weight than you are in a deadlift.  That difference in weight matters.  If any single muscle is a weak point outside of grip, just by the nature of the movement it’ll be brought up to par quickly.</p>

<p>I’m not saying there isn’t a place for something like RDLs in programming, either for hypertrophy or strength, but arguing cutting deadlifts completely is optimal for hypertrophy is dumb.</p>

<p>But tell me, what is your experience in this area?  I look at your profile and I see someone who is mostly inexperienced in the area of fitness who seemingly has a lot of answers for people but also a lot of questions.  I on the other hand have a 295 squat and 315 deadlift.</p>

<div class="md"><p>Many bodybuilders and hypertrophy coaches avoid traditional deadlifts. There is a reason for that: <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/CSKWVmhL-4Z/?utm_medium=copy_link">https://www.instagram.com/p/CSKWVmhL-4Z/?utm_medium=copy_link</a></p>

<p>I could in theory just do flat bench only for chest, tris and shoulders. However I&#39;d be better off choosing the best exercise for each of those muscles if I wanted to optimise aesthetics.</p>

<p>I wouldn&#39;t say I&#39;m inexperienced. I&#39;ve been lifting weights two or three days a week for a few years. I don&#39;t squat or deadlift anymore, but for 15 reps I do 100kg romanian deadlifts, 110kg hack squats and 280kg leg press.</p>

<div class="md"><p>Don&#39;t have to, it&#39;s an effective way to hit a large number of muscle groups all in one go. I would at minimum keep in some RDL variation. </p>

<p>Deadlifts are nowhere near as dangerous as people make out to be. For every 1 person I hear getting an injury from deadlifts I must hear 10 people getting shoulder injuries from benching or overhead press, no one ever seems to stress issues with these exercises though. Just practise good form and don&#39;t lift too heavy too often, which should always be the approach with aesthetic goals in mind.</p>

<p>The DL doesn&#39;t come with higher injury risks compared to any other exercise if you follow intelligent programming and lift within your means.</p>
