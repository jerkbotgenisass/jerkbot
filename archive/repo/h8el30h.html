<div class="md"><p>If my grip is a factor, I can use straps.  While an RDL or SLDL can target a muscle more directly, you are also lifting less weight than you are in a deadlift.  That difference in weight matters.  If any single muscle is a weak point outside of grip, just by the nature of the movement it’ll be brought up to par quickly.</p>

<p>I’m not saying there isn’t a place for something like RDLs in programming, either for hypertrophy or strength, but arguing cutting deadlifts completely is optimal for hypertrophy is dumb.</p>

<p>But tell me, what is your experience in this area?  I look at your profile and I see someone who is mostly inexperienced in the area of fitness who seemingly has a lot of answers for people but also a lot of questions.  I on the other hand have a 295 squat and 315 deadlift.</p>

<p>....why lmao</p>

<p>you could also pull way more weight from 20&quot; blocks but it&#39;s not clear how that causes more hypertrophy. the weight used for two different movements does not really tell you anything about their hypertrophy stimulus</p>

<div class="md"><p>Because it represents an increased stimulus to similar areas.  Are you pretending to be stupid?  Of course it&#39;s not one for one.</p>

<div class="md"><p>so you can probably quarter squat way more weight than you can squat to parallel. should you do quarter squats for hypertrophy? you should get an increased stimulus to similar areas!</p>

<div class="md"><p>Yes, many bodybuilders do use partial squats to maintain tension on their quads through the entire set.  I think that was a Tom Platz thing originally if you want to google up a picture of him.</p>

<div class="md"><p>i wasnt asking about other bodybuilders who made their own decisions for possibly other reasons. i want to know what <em>you</em> specifically do in training. if you squat or deadlift with standard technique, how come you  don&#39;t quarter squat or pull from blocks? by your own logic, you should get increased stimulus.</p>

<div class="md"><p>lol you lil bullshit artist acting like that didn&#39;t answer your bullshit question.  They made their decision for the specific reason of hypertrophy because they&#39;re bodybuilders.</p>

<p>I do pull from blocks in addition to pulling from the floor--I&#39;ve used a shit ton of deadlift variations .  I&#39;ve utilized quarter squats along with jump squats for power output.  I don&#39;t have any examples of utilizing them for hypertrophy because lower body hypertrophy has never been a priority for me.  I&#39;m fine with what I&#39;m getting as a secondary benefit of focused work on other facets of training.</p>

<p>I&#39;ve also used bands and other assistance devices for overloading in countless movements.  </p>

<p>How much ya banch?</p>
