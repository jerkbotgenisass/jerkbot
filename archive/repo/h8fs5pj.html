<div class="md"><p>I never said they&#39;re the same, but they&#39;re still all bench presses. </p>

<p>And no, a &quot;car&quot; would be working out. A &quot;Porsche&quot; would be what lift you&#39;re doing, and the model would be the variant. So my comparison still checks out.</p>

<div class="md"><p>You sound like a guy who does hacksquats and brags about big prs as if it was a real squat… bet you consider front to be just as hard as a back squat cause they are both squats so they are the same…</p>

<p>I tried to fix your uneducated car analogy</p>

<p>I forget the uneducated younger kids don’t understand words having meaning and wash everything to what best suits their idea of what should be right. Sumo deadlift is a lift, it’s completely unimpressive as i can literally pull 100-125 lbs more doing it</p>

<p>Ever notice social media lifters who sumo ALWAYS point out its recognized by powerlifting blah blah blah… they know people see it as bs and justify it to be as legitimate as the old ideal and standards. </p>

<p>She can lift an insane amount of weight i never spoke bad on her… just the wrong name for the wrong lift.</p>

<div class="md"><p>You should tell all the powerlifting federations they are wrong since literally none of them specify a difference between sumo and conventional.</p>

<div class="md"><p>Im not saying they are wrong, im simply saying workouts? Lifts? have names. These names often denote a specific workout. I haven’t said anything negative on the gal lifting. Just that she is doing a sumo deadlift. </p>

<p>Im not saying a sumo deadlift is “not a real deadlift” I have said it is cheating the rep to the max extent possible to move the max weight…. Which is the point of powerlifting. </p>

<p>You ever seen that guy who does “worlds heaviest overhead press” big fat blob of a guy banging hundreds of lbs on a smith machine moving it mere inches. I would say that is in fact not an overhead press. As an overhead press has things like form and range of motion. All the woke babies of democrat reddit just getting too hurt feelings too easily</p>

<p>My words saying its a sumo deadlift got reported as harassment… speaks volumes of how weak society is</p>

<p>I’m getting downvoted solely because they stated it as the wrong lift.</p>

<p>If you think a sumo deadlift isn’t a deadlift then you disagree with every powerlifting federation. Not sure what politics have to do with it lol.</p>

<div class="md"><p>Its a deadlift… its a sumo deadlift. </p>

<p>Like bench press… i can hit maybe 85lbs more on decline bench… if i put a “new pr bench video up” and then you watch the video and im max arch decline bench a lot of people would call shenanigans. </p>

<p>Politics? Every forum… literally every sub i happen across has a wide range of Biden is our savior none sense…. Even idiotsincars or whatever simply posts pics of other cars that have bumper stickers slightly below chortling the balls of the current dictator. You know mass censorship, words mean what i want, rules exist only in my favor regime… and its here….. </p>

<p>Which their politics encompasses this topic… because tomorrow i could just say… hmmm i feel like a lady and then? Proceed to crush many female powerlifting records. Which has been happening(not by me but others)</p>

<p>Thanks for admitting that your initial statement is wrong. 
I don’t know what you’re taking about with the rest of that comment because nobody in this comment thread is talking about anything you mentioned.</p>

<div class="md"><p>Well clearly comprehension is tough… </p>

<p>I am saying words have meaning. A dead lift is a workout, a variation of the deadlift is still a workout. </p>

<p>I never said she wasnt deadlifting i only clarified she is doing a sumo deadlift</p>

<p>Im saying your acceptance of misrepresentation and drive to solidify misuse of words probably stems from social programming thats been especially heavy this last year or two… well 5-6 really as the msm has been out in force to mislead people and remove their own critical thinking ability. </p>

<p>I grew up with “sticks and stones may break my bones but words will never hurt me” and i would guess you grew up in the “words are literally violence”</p>
