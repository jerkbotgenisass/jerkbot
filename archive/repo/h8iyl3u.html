<div class="md"><p>How do you develop more of a muscle mind connection?</p>

<p>If the top question has been asked a billion times before then how do you benchpress without fucking up your shoulders? It seems like I can&#39;t keep them tucked in</p>

<div class="md"><p>Lie below bar such that bar is just above your nose. Slightly lift your back off the bench. Lightly graze the bar with your fingers and hover them over the bar such that they are equidistant from the center. Don&#39;t grip yet. Retract and depress your scapula. Do it hard enough that your hands move away from each other. Grip the bar lightly while holding the scapula squeeze. Rest your back on the bench while holding the scapula squeeze. Firm your grip. At this point, raise the bar by doing nothing more than straightening your arms at the elbows. Make sure to focus on your scapula all this time. (If you are unable to get the bar off the rungs by just straightening your elbows, lower the height of the rungs, and start all over again.) Move the bar to chest level. Start doing reps.</p>

<div class="md"><p>Usually I try to &quot;open my chest&quot; before lifting the bar i.e. I try to relax my shoulders --&gt; raise my hands in front of me --&gt;  try to make my shoulder blades touch each other --&gt; and then I lift the bar. This helps me alot to isolate my chest over my shoulders.</p>

<p>Other thing is lifting the bar at the right &quot;level&quot;, by level I mean that in my case I place it right above the bottom of my pecs to perform the exercise. I can&#39;t tell you to place it this way but you should try to find the right spot and use the technique I told you above with an empty bar. I&#39;m an amateur but I hope my sharing will help you...

<div class="md"><p>Gradually through focus and experience with the movement. You can try and find additional cues for certain movements from YouTube for example.</p>

<p>If you only retract your scapulae, try also depressing it before grabbing the bar.</p>

<div class="md"><p>A mmc isn’t necessary and I haven’t once, at any point in my life, considered it while lifting.</p>

<p>As for how you bench without messing your shoulders up, that sounds like a form issue.  Have you posted a form check here?</p>
