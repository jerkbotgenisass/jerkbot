Still good morning my squats? Stuck at this weight for 2 weeks with accessories to try build core and quad strength

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>These are low bar squats </p>

<p>So I’ve been on stronglifts about 2 months now, but squats are really hard for me. I have 33/34 inch legs and am only 5’5 so my long femurs make them very uncomfortable and I seem to always look like I’m good morning my weight.</p>

<p>Some vids-</p>

<p><a href="https://streamable.com/u8ey9k">https://streamable.com/u8ey9k</a></p>

<p>My back doesn’t hurt at all after but they don’t look like the squats I see in videos and starting strength models. </p>

<p>I have been working on the cues back tight pull down on the bar with lats. Narrow grip. Confident duck under bar, short steps out, brace stomach and flex abs. Drive the triangle into the bar.</p>

<p>I have been doing alternating pause squats 30kg 8 reps 3 sets, and kettlebell squats which are now at 20kg 10x3. </p>

<p>And also leg press 100kg 15 reps 3 sets.</p>

<p>Should I stick with this weight and keep my accessories up or move to 45kg.</p>

<p>Also doing t bar rows and lat pull downs for back strength to support rows and squat and deadlift.</p>

<div class="md"><p>You sure man? Squats feel so weird because like I said I was shocked when I measured my inseam length today so I know it’ll never look like a good perfect form</p>

<p>I saw Layne Norton squat a similar way though, lots of forward lean</p>

<p>I’ll watch all those videos, i know I do better low bar than high bar. If I do that though I’m worried I’ll come on here in a couple months post a form check and everyone will say Deload it’s completely wrong</p>

<p>If a person is saying that there&#39;s only one way that a squat can look like, they&#39;re not worth listening to. People will squat differently based on a lot of factors, leverages being one of them. Learning to squat for yours will you do much better than trying to squat in a way that&#39;s not fit for you. Round hole square peg and all that.</p>

<div class="md"><p>I&#39;m similar to you in that I have long femurs (I&#39;m about 5&#39;11 but with a 6&#39;4 wingspan, I&#39;m basically all limbs) and I similarly have a lot of forward lean and low bar.

<div class="md"><p>Thanks for the input, yeah I definitely feel better with low bar than high bar, cause when I try high bar I lean forward way too much for high bar </p>

<p>Did you make good strength gains in your squat, and build muscle in your legs? I’m concerned I’m not hitting my legs enough by leaning over and maybe using my back too much, hence why I’ve added all those assistance exercises for legs</p>

<p>Glad to know someone else with a long legs ratio still has persisted with squats and not given up or anything</p>

<div class="md"><p>My best squat is 140kg starting out from a 1rm of I think 30kg about 2 years ago (with about 9 months or however long of no lifting due to gyms being shut) so not like amazing astonishing results but it has improved especially once I settled into doing low bar and accepting that there will be lean instead of like obsessing over it. My legs are bigger now but then past the first 6 months where I didn&#39;t have a clue what I was doing and just made up my own silly program I&#39;ve done lunges, split squats, leg press etc.</p>

<div class="md"><p>I disagree, in fact the only good thing in Starting Strength is that they definitely teach you how to squat properly. Have you read the book? There&#39;s like 80 pages about how to squat.</p>

<p>The programming is bad, and the nutrition advice is terrible, but they make a good job teaching the basic lifts (except the overhead press, idk what the hell rippetoe was thinking there).</p>

<div class="md"><p>Well, that&#39;s the thing with beginners. They need to be taught one way to squat, and once they have learned how to do it, they can slightly change it to better suit their needs/anatomy. I don&#39;t know if you remember when you were a beginner, but you had no clue about if what you were doing was good, safe, or had any way to tell the difference. </p>

<p>Unless OP has access to a professional trainer (a good one, someone that teaches you the lifts, not a glorified rep counter), they are much better off learning one way from a good source than trying to guess how the movement is done. Squatting properly is difficult.</p>

<div class="md"><p>Meh.. who cares, it&#39;s not like the LP phase should last more than 3-6 months, I don&#39;t think it matters at all if you do SL or SS before changing up to a &quot;real&quot; routine like an upper/lower or PPL.</p>

<p>Well, like I said, the only good thing about SS is their technique resources. Take that from it and leave their silly ideas, their programming, and their nutrition to themselves. Have you actually read the book? I haven&#39;t seen a more detailed explanation on how to squat than there, and refered to it for many years.</p>

<div class="md"><p>Yeah.. Because of the many hours of real life coaching they have in their youtube channel, and the like 80 page chapter on how to squat of their book are the least likely to result in bad form.</p>

<p>Like, type in youtube &quot;how to squat&quot;, you&#39;ll find tons of 10-15 minute videos. Do you honestly thing that&#39;s a good place to learn something as complex as a squat? Can they cover everything in any amount of detail? I&#39;d say no.</p>

<p>Honestly I&#39;d go as far as to say that if you haven&#39;t been taught by a coach IRL, then you shouldn&#39;t be squatting at all. I hate how it is somehow considered the holy grail of gains and it&#39;s claimed that it boosts your testosterone and whatever, when in reality something like a lunge or a leg press machine is just as effective (unless powerlifting is the goal, ofc) and much harder to screw up. It&#39;s just not worth it, but if someone wants to squat, then the SS method is very well explained and is available in video + book, so why not learn it from them.</p>

<p>Honestly I&#39;d be as far as to say that if you haven&#39;t been taught by a coach IRL, then you shouldn&#39;t be squatting in the first place.</p>

<p>My god dude it&#39;s a squat. Good lord you don&#39;t need an elite level to learn a basic human movement pattern</p>

<div class="md"><p>How many years have you been lifting and how old are you?</p>

<p>Squating might seem like no big deal if you&#39;re young, but if you do it slightly wrong for 10+ years, with 3+ plates, you&#39;re definitely going to injure yourself eventually, there&#39;s no way around that. Why would you squat when you can just do a leg press which is much harder to screw up and doesn&#39;t compress your spine?</p>

<p>inb4 stabilizers: Okay, do lunges instead. Since it&#39;s an asymetric movement it will work them even more than the squat, and you&#39;ll be using like a third of the load so it&#39;s much less stress on the body still.</p>

<p>You&#39;re gonna injure yourself eventually anyway. Fearmongering squats won&#39;t help.</p>

<p>Because squatting is a much more natural movement that I literally use every day?</p>

<p>I personally know people that have been working out for 20+ years and never had a gym related injury. You know what they all have in common? They don&#39;t squat, bench, or deadlift.</p>

<p>The movement might be natural, but the barbell with 140+kg on your back definitely isn&#39;t.  If you want to do something with more risk for no added benefit then go nuts, but to me it seems like not the best way to train.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t understand why you&#39;d dogmatically force someone to do something in a way that doesn&#39;t work for them and then force them to unlearn it later. That makes no sense.</p>

<div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t understand why you assume that the SS squat doesn&#39;t work for people.</p>

<p>But to answer your question: Because beginners aren&#39;t able to figure out by themselves if they&#39;re doing things correctly or not, therefore you have to lay out EVERYTHING so there&#39;s no room for error.</p>

<p>Also how different do you think the SS squat is to a &quot;normal&quot; squat? Because to me they look pretty much the same. A barbell on your back, kept over the middle of your foot, you get your ass down, and then back up. Is it the foot position? The bar position? What exactly is causing all that hypothetical people so many issues with that squat? Have you even read the book?</p>

<p>Do you genuinely think every person should squat in the exact same way and that nobody is better off actually finding what works for them and sticking to it instead of just dogmatically following the form suggested by fat pink man?</p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>There is no &quot;normal&quot; squat. That&#39;s the point. The issue isn&#39;t that Rips squat can&#39;t work, it&#39;s that some people will find that works for them and some won&#39;t. It&#39;s been a while since I read SS or listened to Rip talk about squats but I&#39;m fairly sure my squat is very similar to what SS suggests. Not because &quot;Rip said do this so I do&quot; but because that&#39;s what works for me.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Have you even read the book?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Yes, I can actually see my copy from here. I read it early on when I started lifting and then ignored it when I realised that bigger and stronger more accomplished people than Rip, including ones who&#39;ve helped me in the gym and trained with me, don&#39;t subscribe to his nonsense. If John Haack walked into a SS gym and did his squat the coach would have an aneurysm, and yet he&#39;s the best powerlifter in the world. If Jamal Browner did his deadlift he would be DQd from the lifting comps SS run and yet he&#39;s still one of the best deadlifters in the world.</p>

<div class="md"><p>Then you find some other reputable source of information that can teach you that movement, how is this not obvious...</p>

<p>I didn&#39;t say anywhere that the SS squat is the best or the only way to do it, I just said that they do a pretty good job at taking someone who doesn&#39;t know how to squat to someone that can do a good, proper squat. Is it the only way to squat? No. Will it work for pretty much every beginner and teach them better than most 5-10 minute youtube videos about &quot;how to squat?&quot; Definitely.</p>
