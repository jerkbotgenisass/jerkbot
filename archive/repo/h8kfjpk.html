<div class="md"><p>What can I say? I like her the way she is. She&#39;s on her own weight-loss journey now and is gradually dropping some pounds, and that&#39;s great but she was a big girl when I met her and I liked her anyway. It&#39;s really that simple, and honestly she doesn&#39;t eat as much as you&#39;d think, at least not that I&#39;ve seen unless she&#39;s hiding it really well; I think it&#39;s a medical issue for her. I really don&#39;t care, I find her attractive, there&#39;s nothing to &quot;handle&quot; for the time being.</p>

<div class="md"><p>Exactly.  My wife is a very curvy woman, and I love it.  Big hips and butt, big boobs, tiny waist.  She was on a medication that made her gain weight, and she said she gained a lot, but I didn&#39;t notice.  I am still incredibly attracted to her and love her body as much as when we got together.  </p>

<p>I do all the cooking in the house, and I cook and prep healthy food.  It&#39;s not her eating habits, I&#39;ll tell you that.  She eats like a mouse half the time.  If I didn&#39;t cook her dinner, she would forget to eat it.</p>

<p>Do I wish she was a little more active?  Yes.  But it&#39;s because I want to do things with her.  Ski/snowboard, ride bikes, hike, swim, rock climb.  She&#39;ll do all of that with me (short of rock climbing), but she&#39;s in grad school so her time is more valuable than mine.  </p>

<p>But, it&#39;s like you said.  She is on her own weight loss journey.  I don&#39;t deal with anything.  I love her the way she is.</p>

<p>So long as she doesn&#39;t get the &quot;Karen&quot; haircut, we&#39;re good.</p>

<div class="md"><p>Lethargic, poor eating habit (forgetting to eat), and healthy food. That girl sounds like she has a real thyroid issue. Beg her to see a doctor.</p>

<div class="md"><p>She goes to the doctor quite often.  As I said, she was on a medication that made her gain weight.</p>

<div class="md"><p>It&#39;s rough. My mom sounds exactly like your partner, barely eats but her body holds the weight. Thank you for being so supportive and loving of your gf, she&#39;s really lucky to have you</p>

<div class="md"><p>You’d be amazed how many women with perfectly healthy thyroids have this exact problem. Usually, the fatigue is due to not getting <em>enough</em> calories, but the women have usually been trained their whole lives to believe they need to eat less because of their weight. Because they’ve eaten so little for so long, their stomachs are quite small, so they physically cannot eat much at a time, so they barely eat enough food to survive which causes quite a bit of fatigue. </p>

<p>There’s very little interest within the medical community to learn why so many women experience this problem, because the vast majority of providers are just stuck on the idea that if a woman is overweight, one of the main causes HAS to be overeating. Since there’s a major systemic problem of women as a whole not being taken at their word by medical providers, there’s not much hope that the issue will be thoroughly researched anytime soon.</p>

<div class="md"><p>So really. Some women in this position could benefit from eating more and working out. Eat more to have the energy to burn the fat. It really goes to show caloric intake should at least be lightly monitored.</p>

<div class="md"><p>Without a doubt. An average sized body needs AT LEAST 2000 calories a day just for basic functions. It would help them to eat more often, since they usually can’t eat very much at one time. </p>

<p>It may not make much of a difference with their size/weight, but their overall health will be greatly improved with more daily caloric intake. Since the increase in calories will likely increase their energy levels, they will be able to be more active which could possibly help with their weight/size, but it’s best if they can just focus on getting healthier overall. </p>

<p>There’s likely a lot more to the weight/size aspect, such as genetics and metabolic differences, but until the medical community takes this issue seriously enough to do proper research on it, we will just have to guess.</p>
