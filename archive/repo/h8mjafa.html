<div class="md"><p>Definitely can get rid of deadlifts if your goal is aesthetics. Deadlifts hit a lot of muscles, but they don&#39;t hit any one muscle particularly well.</p>

<div class="md"><p>Agreed. People mad because hurr durr deadlift good. </p>

<p>Arnold did have an aesthetic physique, he also had some very ineffective / inefficient training techniques (as did everyone at the time).</p>

<div class="md"><p>Such as overtraining, doing less effective movements (like doing chest flyes as that strange compound movement, also usually not doing good compound flyes with cables for more constant tension), bent over rows. There’s way more that I’m not interested enough to remember by heart.   </p>

<p>Another general example - quite heavy reliance on oral steroids like Dbol. It worked for Arnold (and others of the same era) but that doesn’t mean it’s a good idea.<br/>
He also is quoted as not drinking milk because “milk is for babies”. Sure he was joking around but he seriously doesn’t drink milk. And hasn’t ever really given a valid reason.   </p>

<p>Unfortunately, Arnold isn’t a great person to look up to. Before we even start on the secret child born of adultery, he was a terrible sportsman back in the day. You’ll have heard the stories of how he used to sabotage his opponents (for example, hiding the trunks of a fellow bodybuilder featured on “Pumping Iron”, can’t remember his name. Also purposefully giving wrong advice to another bodybuilder, although he was apparently quite egotistical).<br/>
Anyways you get my point. Just because Arnold did it, doesn’t mean everyone else should. </p>

<p>There are a lot of training techniques that should have died with the “golden age”. Of course the Arnold era Olympias had the best physiques. I admire these people as well. But we do know a bit more now than we did then.   </p>

<p>I do not understand why there’s this idea that <em>everyone</em> should deadlift. If you are bodybuilding, what’s the point in getting light stimulation over a lot of muscle groups? It just means you need to give them more rest (you have to rest your back, legs, shoulders etc all at once - so you can’t train basically anything the day after deadlifts).<br/>
That’s without even starting on the potential for injury.   </p>

<p>We are all training for different goals. It’s a bit dumb - nay, selfish even - to have this big circlejerk over deadlifts, when they are in no way necessary for anyone who just wants to train to look better.<br/>
If you like to include deadlifts in your routine, good for you, please keep doing them, but it doesn’t mean everyone should do them.   </p>

<p>How was he overtraining?</p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>What&#39;s wrong with chest flies and why does it matter what sort of flies he does?</p>

<p>bent over rows. </p>

<p>Wtf is wrong with bent over rows?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>There’s way more that I’m not interested enough to remember by heart.   </p>

<p>Wow. I can&#39;t wait to hear. </p>

<p>How good is your physique if you know so much better than Arnold?</p>

<blockquote>

<p>Did they have any other options?</p>

<p>Yeah... because Pumping Iron was 100% real..</p>

<p>Do I?</p>

<p>Are there really?</p>

<p>Do you really though?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I do not understand why there’s this idea that <em>everyone</em> should deadlift.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>No-one says this. They&#39;re just recommended because they&#39;re one of the best bang-for-your-buck exercises available.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>Deadlifts? Light stimulation? Maybe you need to lift heavier weight....</p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>There&#39;s nothing stopping you from training any of those muscles the day after. Srs.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>That’s without even starting on the potential for injury.   </p>
</blockquote>

<p>There&#39;s potential for injury in any activity. Deadlifts aren&#39;t inherently more dangerous.</p>

<p>No-one says they&#39;re necessary. Srs.</p>
