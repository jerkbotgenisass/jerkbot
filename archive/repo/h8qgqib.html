<div class="md"><p>I double checked your math. You are just wrong. Assuming an acceleration of 9.8 m/s<sup>2,</sup> the force applied to your body by the toddler comes out to <em>1354 N</em> when you do the equation</p>

<p>(9.072kg)(15.24m)(9.8 m/s<sup>2)</sup></p>

<p>When you do the force applied by the man it comes out to <em>829N</em></p>

<p>(90.7kg)(.94m)(9.8 m/s<sup>2)</sup></p>

<p>So you actually experience much more force trying to save the toddler. The man should be easier to stop due to the momentum of the toddler being so great (although I only did the calculation of force applied. Finding momentum would be a bit harder)</p>

<p>Edit: although the strength required to save the man is obviously greater. You just need the strength to stop the toddler, once the momentum is gone you are good. The man you do need the strength to hold 200lbs. But I was just pointing out, not as simple as the toddler being so easy</p>

<p>I mean that’s cool and all if you’re trying to stop the man from falling from 0.94m. In this case, though, you’re trying to stop him from falling 3m. Unless I’m missing something?</p>

<div class="md"><p>Energy is mgh. Toddler is about 15 kgs. 5 times the height. So if the man is 75 kgs it&#39;s about equivalent if we&#39;re neglecting air resistance.

<div class="md"><p>Who won this debate? Respond !!!!</p>

<p><a href="/u/whyyyyoy">/u/whyyyyoy</a> is right about proper bracing, the fireman was mainly able to catch him because of the way he planted himself. That being said, he definitely could&#39;ve hurt himself on this one.</p>

<p>I doubt <a href="/u/whyyyyoy">/u/whyyyyoy</a> cares about <a href="/u/ThisPortalCoil">/u/ThisPortalCoil</a> &#39;s back or his military service, so hes insincere on his part, if its true. </p>

<p><a href="/u/ThisportalCoil">/u/ThisportalCoil</a> fucked up in the end game with his last two responses, no grace whatsoever. Goes to show that we should not praise soldiers as anything beyond a regular person.</p>

<div class="md"><p><a href="/u/inbredinbed">/u/inbredinbed</a> Absolutely should not praise people based on their status. We&#39;re mostly shit. I can say that authoritatively. That said, lol fuck u.</p>
