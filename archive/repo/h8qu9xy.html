<div class="md"><p>Has anyone had any issues with anus pain a day after cardio? I only feel it when I squeeze it or when I try do cardio again for the next day. It goes away when I give myself a few days of rest. I&#39;m looking for tips on how to avoid this and whether this is just a beginner mistake.</p>
