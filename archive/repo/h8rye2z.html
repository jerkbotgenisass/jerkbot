<div class="md"><p>Here’s a question.. I’m a scrawny guy trying to put some muscle on his frame. I’m 5’11 and around 180 lbs. in order to shed a little bit of fat on my belly and to buff up my muscle, what workouts do I start with, how many days a week, and what supplements should I take? I really wanna get started but I’m scared to waste time if I’m not gonna be impactful.</p>

<div class="md"><p>My dude, you are a rank beginner who doesn’t know anything.  Maybe don’t answer questions here.  That said, if you feel the need to; “spend money on a thing you possibly don’t need that doesn’t benefit you at all if you don’t need it” is not a valuable answer and you shouldn’t do that.</p>

<p>You don’t even understand basic nutrition as evidenced by <a href="https://reddit.com/r/GYM/comments/ovyl9g/having_takeaway_2_days_in_a_row/">this question</a> less than 2 weeks ago.  Maybe sit this one out before you get hurt.</p>

<div class="md"><p>And I disagree with telling him to use protein powder without knowing what the rest of his diet is like.  You answered the question with incomplete information which means your answer was bad.  You could have said “if you need more protein, use protein powder” but you didn’t say that because you don’t know enough to make that distinction.  You just wanted to answer questions to feel helpful or smart without thinking about whether someone who barely knows how to tie their shoes should be offering advice in this thread.</p>
