<div class="md"><p>That&#39;s fair. Comments like that I just don&#39;t respond to with significant effort, because why would I? It&#39;s clear to me this person is largely ignorant and is now offended because after saying something silly someone told the rest of the world that it&#39;s silly. Here&#39;s my deconstruction of her/his post as someone who has actually had vitamin deficient patients.</p>

<p>1) The most common causes of vitamin deficiency is either malnutrition in that the person is NOT eating at all or alcohol leading to B1 deficiency or veganism or carnivore. There&#39;s going to be someone grossly excluding a particular food group, not eating enough food in general, or for alcoholics B1 is used to sequester acetaldehyde so it gets depleted there. There&#39;s some other cases like pernicious anemia leading to B12 -- autoimmune destruction of gastric cells leading to a blunting of intrisic factor -- or gastric bypass fucking up B9/B12, etc. Usually though, if you&#39;re obese you&#39;re probably getting enough micro-nutrients from food fortification unless you&#39;re eating Twinkies every single day or something really egregious like that. </p>

<p>2) Beta carotene is usually derived from vitamin A, which is a fat soluble vitamin and VERY RARE to have a deficiency in if you life in a developed countries. It&#39;s extremely common if you live in a developing country. Omega 3 is not a required micronutrient. It&#39;s a type of fat. Supplementing omega 3 has not been demonstrated to have a health benefit. Go figure, since I keep hearing fish oil nonsense about it. Vitamin K, as I said, is bad to supplement with unless you&#39;re a neonate. You have bacteria in your intestines that make it for you. </p>

<p>3) Sodium and potassium balance isn&#39;t optimal for physical performance, it&#39;s required for life. Too much sodium and you have cerebral edema. Too little and you have seizures -&gt; coma -&gt; death. Too much potassium and you kill someone -- lethal injection -- too little and your heart also stops beating. Sodium and potassium are highly regulated by the kidney and if you have an issue with either it&#39;s because you&#39;re supplementing too hard with one of them, eating foods that are way too high in either, or have kidney disease. </p>

<p>4) The modern diet does not put people into sugar spikes and troughs. The current recommended diet by health experts is the DASH diets and it maintains a stable blood sugar. It&#39;s also been demonstrated to have effectively lowered blood pressure in a landmark trial. For the homies who drink 5L of coke every day, eat a pint of ice cream before bed, and most of their meals are simple carbs then yes insulin spikes are a genuine concern. For adults who understand how to eat in a healthy way and eat their vegetables insulin spikes are not a concern. </p>

<p>When I&#39;m reading the other homie&#39;s comment and it&#39;s so painfully obvious that s/he has no idea what s/he is talking about, why should I waste my time responding in the detail I just did? They&#39;re clearly not trying to learn when they&#39;re trying to fallacy fallacy me and straw manning me instead of actually engaging in a productive discussion. Furthermore, to even start telling this dude that s/he is so off point we need to go over basic statistics soas to talk about what the likelihood ratio is for someone coming in with a vitamin deficiency, let alone incidence/prevalence, it&#39;s like why bother? So, I&#39;m good not engaging with homies like that and just dismissing them.</p>

<div class="md"><p>So you know this, yet you don&#39;t at all address the fact that most modern Americans actually are micronutrient deficient as evidenced by the rate of chronic disease, obesity, and mental health issues - all of which are largely behavioral.</p>

<p>Feel free to present actual epidemiological evidence that I&#39;m actually wrong about the average adult&#39;s diet model rather than nitpick bad vs severe nutrient deficiency or false pedantic differentiation between calling Omega-3&#39;s fatty acids vs micronutrients.  Or pretend that the food pyramid popularized by the health establishment is not a pro-diabetes diet responsible arguably for our 35%+ rate of diabetes.</p>

<p>My point was that the typical beginner is not just new to kettlebells, but to fitness in general.  And odds are, they have engaged in a poor diet model for most of their lives.  It doesn&#39;t matter how much you train if your diet sucks - you will struggle to see gains, which has a knock on effect on motivation.  Just saying &quot;eat like an adult&quot; and claiming supplements are enough suggests you know enough to think you sound smart, but can&#39;t actually have a nuanced discussion about full spectrum fitness.</p>

<p>My sources are UpToDate and Dynamed, which collectively cost ~$1,000 so good luck with that.</p>

<p>Neat, that&#39;s meaningless to me, TBH.</p>

<div class="md"><p>Bro this is literally nutrition 101 level.</p>

<p>Yes, its very clear that a basic understanding of sports nutrition is less valuable to you than feeling like you&#39;ve dunked on someone.</p>
