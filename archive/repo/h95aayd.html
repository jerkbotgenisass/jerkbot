<div class="md"><p>For real though. Influencer fitness is an absolute cancer. Just a bunch of roided out people trying to sell their exercise programs while proclaiming they don’t take anything.</p>

<div class="md"><p>Today the trend is all about sarms, especially tik tok teens or early 20 fucking their development and ruinining their lives.</p>

<p>They use roids and chemicals because let&#39;s be honest, most of the people don&#39;t have genetics favourable to develop lean muscle. Plus working out without results after a couple of months is plain depressing and you drop out, that&#39;s what happens to most. </p>

<p>But if they take testosterone, ephedrine and sarm they can always feel full and ripped.</p>

<div class="md"><p>2lbs if muscle a week for a couple of months? I find that very hard to believe. And you’d still have to train incredibly hard and your diet would have to be on point. And it seems likely to me that someone who has training, recovery, and diet on point is going to be informed enough to know not to expect insane results in a couple months</p>

<div class="md"><p>10 week trial</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Body weight did not change significantly in the men in either placebo group (Table 4). The men given testosterone without exercise had a significant mean increase in total body weight, and those in the testosterone-plus-exercise group had an average increase of 6.1 kg in body weight — a greater increase than in the other three groups.</p>

<p>Fat-free mass did not change significantly in the group assigned to placebo but no exercise (Table 4 and Figure 1). The men treated with testosterone but no exercise had an increase of 3.2 kg in fat-free mass, and those in the placebo-plus-exercise group had an increase of 1.9 kg. The increase in the testosterone-plus-exercise group was substantially greater (averaging 6.1 kg). The percentage of body fat did not change significantly in any group (data not shown).</p>

<p>And the population studied was</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The exercise was standardized in all the men, and therefore the effects of testosterone on muscle size and strength cannot be attributed to more intense training in the groups receiving the treatment. <strong>Careful selection of experienced weight lifters, the exclusion of competitive athletes, and close follow-up ensured a high degree of compliance</strong> with the regimens of exercise, treatment, and diet</p>
