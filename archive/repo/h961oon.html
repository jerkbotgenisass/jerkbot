<div class="md"><p>So you have no idea what both of those are. How much do you squat btw?</p>

<li> It isn’t relevant</li>

<p>Again, there’s a difference between safety and output. The guy himself said this was the most pressure he’s ever felt on his back. That isn’t good</p>

<div class="md"><p>Wow that is a big number indeed. I highly doubt it though, since you can&#39;t tell a squat and a good morning apart.</p>

<p>You wouldn&#39;t happen to have any videos of your achievements?</p>

<p>Also, the pressure was probably because the fucking bar was bending on his goddamn back.</p>

<div class="md"><p>I don’t film myself lol. I also squat that while never really focusing on output. Again, focusing on output isn’t great for longevity, and frankly stupid for most people</p>

<p>I think we’re saying the same thing. I’m saying his form was initially very good, but the bar bending around his back likely sacrificed that form</p>

<p>You never want to bend at the waist as much as he ended up doing, but it’s understandable given the circumstance</p>

<p>That said, the form still isn’t ideal considering it put as much pressure as it did on his back</p>

<p>Your back is significantly weaker than your legs. Putting the strain on that with 600+ lbs isn’t a good practice and isn’t great for longevity. Most power lifters don’t care much for longevity though, considering most end up with hip/knee replacements and chronic back injuries anyway</p>

<p>As to your focus on my form/how much I can squat, it’s ad hominem. Cus D’Amato was never a world class boxer himself, but coached Floyd Patterson, Jose Torres, and Mike Tyson to HOF careers. I’m not Cus D’Amato, but the point still stands</p>
