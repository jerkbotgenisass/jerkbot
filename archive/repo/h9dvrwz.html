<div class="md"><p>Why do people at the gym always ask ME how many more sets I have left? I&#39;d be using the bench press and a guy next to me would have been using his bench for maybe 10 mins before I started. And some random guy would always ask me how many more sets I have left. If I say I have 3 sets left, they leave but never ask the guy next to me. It actually pisses me off - so much so that it gives me energy to do another rep in my next set. </p>

<p>Doesn&#39;t matter bench, squat rack, cables etc. I don&#39;t get it. I&#39;ve got my earphones on, I&#39;m not on my phone and am focused on myself - but the guy next to me who&#39;s just fucking around never gets asked. </p>

<p>Is it because people think I&#39;m a nice guy and approachable? Then if that was the case why do I not get any matches on tinder if I look like such a nice and approachable guy. If I walk on the street, some random girl looking for donations for a charity will always pick me out of a crowd to talk to. Always. But these same people will always swipe left on me on tinder. Always. Makes me hate these people.</p>
