<div class="md"><p>I don’t get Reddit’s obsession with deadlift. I personally know two people who herniated disks deadlifting. Not worth it.</p>

<div class="md"><p>What&#39;s not to get? They&#39;re one the best bang-for-your-buck exercises available and are relatively safe if you&#39;re using decent technique.</p>

<div class="md"><p>The fact that so many people cripple themselves doing it kinda negates the idea that it’s good bag for your buck. Anyone can mess up one rep out of a thousand and destroy their backs.</p>

<div class="md"><p>&quot;So many people&quot; do not cripple themselves doing it. Some hurt themselves occasionally, but that&#39;s the same with any lift. Most recover and return to lifting.</p>

<p>Tell me you don&#39;t know much about lifting without actually telling me you don&#39;t know much about lifting...</p>

<div class="md"><p>Lol. An elbow ouchy is hardly the worst possible bench press injury.</p>

<p>You&#39;re being overly alarmist. Your friends likely didn&#39;t know what they were doing and injured themselves because of that. Don&#39;t blame the deadlifts, blame the lifter.</p>

<div class="md"><p>One had been lifting for years and could deadlift over 600lbs. The other was a college track runner who although wasn’t that strong was trained by a strength coach to deadlift. You obviously are very defensive and don’t know what you are talking about.</p>

<div class="md"><p>Well the 600lb deadlifter might have been over-eager or just unlucky. Who the fuck knows with the track sprinter. Not all S&amp;C coaches are great deadlift coaches. Regardless, don&#39;t blame the deadlifts. They&#39;re not inherently risky.</p>
