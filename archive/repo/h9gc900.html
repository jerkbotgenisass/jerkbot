<p>It is a necessary fat, but very easy to get from poor sources.</p>

<div class="md"><p>When a chicken is allowed to be free ranged, they are able to eat their natural diet and get exposure to sunlight, which can improve the quality/Omega 3 content of the eggs they produce.  </p>

<p>Fats are where toxins are stored on animals, and an animal (human included) that eats a foreign diet is going to have a greater degree of toxins compared to one that lives off it&#39;s natural diet.  So if I&#39;m going to go out of my way to get in fat, I want to get it from an animal that was able to eat it&#39;s natural diet.  Otherwise, I go for fat free versions of animal products.</p>

<p>Define &quot;free ranged.&quot; I think you&#39;ll find it&#39;s typically not the chickens-running-free-in-a-green-pasture-full-of-sunlight-and-wildflowers situation that many people envisage.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>they are able to eat their natural diet</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Source? Also: could you please define &quot;natural diet?&quot;</p>

<blockquote>
<p>and get exposure to sunlight,</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Not necessarily; many (most?) &quot;free range&quot; egg production operations are in large barns/enclosures.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>which can improve the quality/Omega 3 content of the eggs they produce.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Source? Also: omega-3 fatty acids are molecules. Kindly explain what &quot;low quality&quot; molecules are (as opposed to &quot;high quality&quot; molecules), and what difference it makes?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Fats are where toxins are stored on animals,</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Can you define &quot;toxins&quot; for us? Also: yes, some compounds in food are fat-soluble, and <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21739161/">can bioaccumulate the fatty tissues in an animal</a>, but that&#39;s not <em>necessarily</em> bad -- or even relevant.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>and an animal (human included) that eats a foreign diet</p>
</blockquote>

<p>What exactly does &quot;foreign diet&quot; mean?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>is going to have a greater degree of toxins </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Which &quot;toxins,&quot; why are they bad, and what precisely does &quot;a greater degree&quot; mean in this context?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>compared to one that lives off it&#39;s natural diet.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Source? And, again: it would really help us if you could explain what a &quot;natural&quot; diet is, and how it differs from an...&quot;unnatural&quot; (?) one.</p>

<p>I suspect you&#39;re going to take this post as a personal attack, as is often the case when people who are invested in something to the point of making it part of their identity (something I have a hunch you may have done) are challenged on those beliefs. But I say this with no disrespect intended whatsoever: you appear to have been gravely misinformed by the &quot;clean eating&quot; crowd. I think that, if you were to try to find <strong>high-quality</strong> evidence from <strong>peer-reviewed</strong> resources to support all these claims you&#39;re making, you&#39;d be quite surprised.</p>

<p>FWIW, I used to believe all this stuff, too -- after all, &quot;everyone knows&quot; it&#39;s true, right? And, it certainly <em>feels</em> &quot;healthier&quot; to eat &quot;natural&quot; foods that don&#39;t use &quot;chemicals&quot; and &quot;hormones&quot; and &quot;toxins,&quot; and so forth. But, then I applied the same degree of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skeptical_movement#Scientific_skepticism">skepticism</a> to my beliefs about nutrition that I would, say, to somebody trying to sell me a car that supposedly gets 100 mpg, or <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homeopathy#Evidence_and_efficacy">a pill or tonic that will purportedly cure all my ills</a>. That is to say, <strong>I challenged my beliefs by searching for high-quality, well-designed studies that produced the evidence I was <em>sure</em> was out there. As it turns out...it&#39;s not.</strong> Most of the feel-good, &quot;clean eating,&quot; pro-organic, &quot;natural&quot; food information is, in fact, pseudoscientific bullshit. Extraordinary claims abound, but the <em>extraordinary evidence</em> required to support those claims is simply not there. Again: challenge yourself to find it in respectable, high-quality, peer-reviewed resources. (One should always be actively challenging their own beliefs and positions on things, anyway.)</p>

<p>Every once in a great while I do miss the feeling I got from knowing (&quot;knowing&quot;) I was &quot;eating clean&quot; and &quot;doing the healthiest thing&quot; I thought I could do; it felt <em>really good!</em> (Sometimes, ignorance really <em>is</em> bliss.) But I only feel this rarely, now; most of the time I&#39;m just glad I no longer believe these untrue, and potentially harmful things. And, moreover, I&#39;m glad I&#39;m no longer spreading that misinformation to others.</p>

<div class="md"><p>Really wish I had coins so I could award this.</p>

<p>Almost all claims about benefits of organic food are not factual. The vast majority of studies show no real non-negligible difference between the nutritional content of organic vs non-organic. The same is true for non-GMO vs GMO produce.</p>

<p>Organic food is a marketing scam, nothing less nothing more.</p>

<p>The beauty of growing organic food is that you can take the same amount of land as conventional ag, but feed less people while using more water.</p>

<p>As far as free range, i do see the ethical benefit but like said above, that&#39;s such a vague term, it really doesn&#39;t mean what people think it means.</p>

<p>Also, anyone who has raised chickens understands that there really isn&#39;t a truly &quot;natural diet&quot; for them. Chickens will <em>literally eat anything</em>. Its actually incredible how much dif things they can eat.</p>

<div class="md"><p>Just for the hell of it you should buy cheap store brand eggs and organic free range eggs(store bought ones are fine they don’t need to be from a farmers market or someone’s backyard). Fry one of each and tell me they’re not completely different. Free range eggs have almost orange yolks that are really thick usually and the cheap ones are a pale yellow with a watery consistency. Free range eggs are clearly better. You don’t really need a bunch of scientific studies to figure that out lol.</p>

<div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t need to buy eggs; I&#39;ve kept chickens for years.</p>

<p>The darker, orange-colors yolks are the result of a higher carotenoid content -- beta-carotene, IIRC. So, if one feeds chickens a grain/seed-based diet, their yolks will be more pale in color. Give &#39;em a handful of lawn clippings, and the next few eggs they lay will be the color of a navel orange! And, as for the runny albumen, that&#39;s largely a product of age. Try this experiment: take some of those &quot;organic,&quot; &quot;free range&quot; eggs you regard as superior and leave them in the fridge for a month. In that time, some of the proteins in the albumen that are (in part) responsible for making it thick and viscous will denature, making it more &quot;watery.&quot; It may not be common information, but due to numerous factors, the eggs in your local mega-mart could well have been laid weeks ago!</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Free range eggs are clearly better.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Define &quot;better.&quot; More aesthetic? That&#39;s a matter of personal taste. More flavorful? Same -- though I&#39;d be surprised if you could identify one from the other in a blind taste test. Ethically? I&#39;d agree; hens in commercial egg production batteries <a href="https://www.china-chickencage.com/wp-content/uploads/egg-production-business.jpg">do not have very nice lives.</a> But, again: &quot;free range&quot; does not mean what most people seem to think it means. From the hens&#39; perspective, the minimum conditions required to label eggs as &quot;free range&quot; are not a huge upgrade from being in a tiny cage.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>You don’t really need a bunch of scientific studies to figure that out lol.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>You&#39;re right -- assuming &quot;better&quot; means &quot;I like them more.&quot; But if by &quot;better,&quot; you mean &quot;more nutritious,&quot; or &quot;more healthful,&quot; or some other objective meaning of the word (which is often the case with these claims), then, <strong>yes, you absolutely DO need a well-designed scientific experiment to produce evidence supporting the claim that they are, indeed, &quot;better.&quot;</strong> Without evidence to support factual claims, how can we determine if they are true or not? As a wise man once said, &quot;claims made without evidence can be dismissed without evidence.&quot;</p>
