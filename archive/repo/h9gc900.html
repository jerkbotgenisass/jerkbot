<p>It is a necessary fat, but very easy to get from poor sources.</p>

<div class="md"><p>When a chicken is allowed to be free ranged, they are able to eat their natural diet and get exposure to sunlight, which can improve the quality/Omega 3 content of the eggs they produce.  </p>

<p>Fats are where toxins are stored on animals, and an animal (human included) that eats a foreign diet is going to have a greater degree of toxins compared to one that lives off it&#39;s natural diet.  So if I&#39;m going to go out of my way to get in fat, I want to get it from an animal that was able to eat it&#39;s natural diet.  Otherwise, I go for fat free versions of animal products.</p>

<p>Define &quot;free ranged.&quot; I think you&#39;ll find it&#39;s typically not the chickens-running-free-in-a-green-pasture-full-of-sunlight-and-wildflowers situation that many people envisage.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>they are able to eat their natural diet</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Source? Also: could you please define &quot;natural diet?&quot;</p>

<blockquote>
<p>and get exposure to sunlight,</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Not necessarily; many (most?) &quot;free range&quot; egg production operations are in large barns/enclosures.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>which can improve the quality/Omega 3 content of the eggs they produce.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Source? Also: omega-3 fatty acids are molecules. Kindly explain what &quot;low quality&quot; molecules are (as opposed to &quot;high quality&quot; molecules), and what difference it makes?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Fats are where toxins are stored on animals,</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Can you define &quot;toxins&quot; for us? Also: yes, some compounds in food are fat-soluble, and <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21739161/">can bioaccumulate the fatty tissues in an animal</a>, but that&#39;s not <em>necessarily</em> bad -- or even relevant.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>and an animal (human included) that eats a foreign diet</p>
</blockquote>

<p>What exactly does &quot;foreign diet&quot; mean?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>is going to have a greater degree of toxins </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Which &quot;toxins,&quot; why are they bad, and what precisely does &quot;a greater degree&quot; mean in this context?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>compared to one that lives off it&#39;s natural diet.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Source? And, again: it would really help us if you could explain what a &quot;natural&quot; diet is, and how it differs from an...&quot;unnatural&quot; (?) one.</p>

<p>I suspect you&#39;re going to take this post as a personal attack, as is often the case when people who are invested in something to the point of making it part of their identity (something I have a hunch you may have done) are challenged on those beliefs. But I say this with no disrespect intended whatsoever: you appear to have been gravely misinformed by the &quot;clean eating&quot; crowd. I think that, if you were to try to find <strong>high-quality</strong> evidence from <strong>peer-reviewed</strong> resources to support all these claims you&#39;re making, you&#39;d be quite surprised.</p>

<p>FWIW, I used to believe all this stuff, too -- after all, &quot;everyone knows&quot; it&#39;s true, right? And, it certainly <em>feels</em> &quot;healthier&quot; to eat &quot;natural&quot; foods that don&#39;t use &quot;chemicals&quot; and &quot;hormones&quot; and &quot;toxins,&quot; and so forth. But, then I applied the same degree of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skeptical_movement#Scientific_skepticism">skepticism</a> to my beliefs about nutrition that I would, say, to somebody trying to sell me a car that supposedly gets 100 mpg, or <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homeopathy#Evidence_and_efficacy">a pill or tonic that will purportedly cure all my ills</a>. That is to say, <strong>I challenged my beliefs by searching for high-quality, well-designed studies that produced the evidence I was <em>sure</em> was out there. As it turns out...it&#39;s not.</strong> Most of the feel-good, &quot;clean eating,&quot; pro-organic, &quot;natural&quot; food information is, in fact, pseudoscientific bullshit. Extraordinary claims abound, but the <em>extraordinary evidence</em> required to support those claims is simply not there. Again: challenge yourself to find it in respectable, high-quality, peer-reviewed resources. (One should always be actively challenging their own beliefs and positions on things, anyway.)</p>

<p>Every once in a great while I do miss the feeling I got from knowing (&quot;knowing&quot;) I was &quot;eating clean&quot; and &quot;doing the healthiest thing&quot; I thought I could do; it felt <em>really good!</em> (Sometimes, ignorance really <em>is</em> bliss.) But I only feel this rarely, now; most of the time I&#39;m just glad I no longer believe these untrue, and potentially harmful things. And, moreover, I&#39;m glad I&#39;m no longer spreading that misinformation to others.</p>

<div class="md"><p>Really wish I had coins so I could award this.</p>

<p>Almost all claims about benefits of organic food are not factual. The vast majority of studies show no real non-negligible difference between the nutritional content of organic vs non-organic. The same is true for non-GMO vs GMO produce.</p>

<p>Organic food is a marketing scam, nothing less nothing more.</p>

<p>The beauty of growing organic food is that you can take the same amount of land as conventional ag, but feed less people while using more water.</p>

<p>As far as free range, i do see the ethical benefit but like said above, that&#39;s such a vague term, it really doesn&#39;t mean what people think it means.</p>

<p>Also, anyone who has raised chickens understands that there really isn&#39;t a truly &quot;natural diet&quot; for them. Chickens will <em>literally eat anything</em>. Its actually incredible how much dif things they can eat.</p>

<div class="md"><p>Just for the hell of it you should buy cheap store brand eggs and organic free range eggs(store bought ones are fine they donâ€™t need to be from a farmers market or someoneâ€™s backyard). Fry one of each and tell me theyâ€™re not completely different. Free range eggs have almost orange yolks that are really thick usually and the cheap ones are a pale yellow with a watery consistency. Free range eggs are clearly better. You donâ€™t really need a bunch of scientific studies to figure that out lol.</p>

<div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t need to buy eggs; I&#39;ve kept chickens for years.</p>

<p>The darker, orange-colors yolks are the result of a higher carotenoid content -- beta-carotene, IIRC. So, if one feeds chickens a grain/seed-based diet, their yolks will be more pale in color. Give &#39;em a handful of lawn clippings, and the next few eggs they lay will be the color of a navel orange! And, as for the runny albumen, that&#39;s largely a product of age. Try this experiment: take some of those &quot;organic,&quot; &quot;free range&quot; eggs you regard as superior and leave them in the fridge for a month. In that time, some of the proteins in the albumen that are (in part) responsible for making it thick and viscous will denature, making it more &quot;watery.&quot; It may not be common information, but due to numerous factors, the eggs in your local mega-mart could well have been laid weeks ago!</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Free range eggs are clearly better.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Define &quot;better.&quot; More aesthetic? That&#39;s a matter of personal taste. More flavorful? Same -- though I&#39;d be surprised if you could identify one from the other in a blind taste test. Ethically? I&#39;d agree; hens in commercial egg production batteries <a href="https://www.china-chickencage.com/wp-content/uploads/egg-production-business.jpg">do not have very nice lives.</a> But, again: &quot;free range&quot; does not mean what most people seem to think it means. From the hens&#39; perspective, the minimum conditions required to label eggs as &quot;free range&quot; are not a huge upgrade from being in a tiny cage.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>You donâ€™t really need a bunch of scientific studies to figure that out lol.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>You&#39;re right -- assuming &quot;better&quot; means &quot;I like them more.&quot; But if by &quot;better,&quot; you mean &quot;more nutritious,&quot; or &quot;more healthful,&quot; or some other objective meaning of the word (which is often the case with these claims), then, <strong>yes, you absolutely DO need a well-designed scientific experiment to produce evidence supporting the claim that they are, indeed, &quot;better.&quot;</strong> Without evidence to support factual claims, how can we determine if they are true or not? As a wise man once said, &quot;claims made without evidence can be dismissed without evidence.&quot;</p>
