<div class="md"><p>My arch is pretty high and i can assure, I&#39;ve failed a few lifts, the bar does not hit me.  It might touch my chest a bit if i bailed a lift towards my belly but in any lift I haven&#39;t made its been good</p>

<div class="md"><p>I mean... There is no grip at all it is just sitting on your palm. Also your body is moving a lot on the bench, It should be rock solid. That&#39;s what I mean by power leakage.</p>

<div class="md"><p>There are three main reasons why you hear lifters advocating for the suicide grip:</p>

<p>It keeps the wrist neutral
It keeps the shoulders in a safe position
It allows you to activate your triceps more</p>

<p>6 Reasons Against Using The Suicide Grip For Bench Press</p>

<p>Letâ€™s now take a look at the reasons why I donâ€™t suggest using the suicide grip for bench press:</p>

<p>You canâ€™t grip the bar as tight
The same wrist position can be achieved using the standard grip
It will be harder to keep your lats tight
Your elbow position may be â€˜too tuckedâ€™
Thereâ€™s a high risk the barbell can fall out of your hands
Itâ€™s against the rules of powerlifting</p>

<div class="md"><p>Your hands wonâ€™t be as tight around the barbell by using a suicide grip versus a normal grip. Having your hands as tight as possible around the barbell is important because it will make the barbell feel â€˜lighterâ€™ in your hands, which will build your confidence under heavy weight.</p>

<p>This occurs because of the idea of proprioception, which is defined as (1) the sense of position and movement of our limbs, (2) the sense of muscle force and effort, and (3) the sense of balance.
So, whether a load feels heavy or light can be partly attributed to our proprioceptive ability to gauge â€˜muscle force and effortâ€™.</p>

<p>Our proprioception is activated by special receptors in our skin, muscles, tendons, and joints. Therefore, as the barbell sits in our hands, itâ€™s constantly providing feedback to our central nervous system about how the load feels and where our limbs are in space.</p>

<p>Itâ€™s been shown that you can increase your proprioceptive ability by creating muscle stiffness. You can generate greater muscle stiffness by squeezing your fingers as hard as possible around the barbell, which will recruit the muscles of the hands and forearm.</p>

<p>If the hands are relaxed, the less proprioceptive ability we have, and the heavier the weight will feel. Alternatively, if the hands are tight, the greater the proprioceptive ability we have, and the lighter the weight will feel.</p>

<p>This is why I always like to tell my athletes to â€˜leave fingerprints on the barbellâ€™ because thatâ€™s how hard I expect them to be squeezing their fingers when bench pressing. You can squeeze your hands much harder in a normal grip vs. a suicide grip.</p>
