Can someone show me pictures of what they're eating?

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Or point me to pictures online somewhere? Here&#39;s the thing - I&#39;ve been skinny my whole life, even back when I was doing weight training. <em>I eat a lot</em>. Well, I thought I was eating a lot. I&#39;m full every day, and I eat large portions. Mostly healthy, whole foods, mostly vegetarian, and I eat dessert. Other than that, I don&#39;t really watch what I eat. I also do a lot of cardio. Mostly dog walks (few times/day) and running or cycling (every day). I think I&#39;ve gotten in the habit of not really watching my diet and letting my cardio cancel it out.</p>

<p>So over the last few weeks I&#39;ve been dialing down my cardio and getting back into weight training in the gym. I&#39;ve also started using MFP to track my calorie intake and here&#39;s what I can&#39;t believe. According to MFP I&#39;m falling short nearly by 500-1000 calories daily (recommended to intake 3000 cals). But I don&#39;t see how I could possibly eat more. I&#39;m already doing 3 regular meals and 2-3 small meals, and I&#39;m too full throughout the day to pack in any more. And this includes 2 protein shakes daily.</p>

<p>I&#39;m really curious to see what you all are eating to compare. If anyone can point me to some pictures of a typical day&#39;s intake I would appreciate it.</p>
