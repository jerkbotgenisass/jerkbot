	<title>First time doing Larson press. Kinda weird but I get why it's programmed, no leg drive all chest power. Bar is not touching safety bars btw. Just there in case I gotta bail out.</title>

<div class="md"><p>I learned to lift from a friend with a bad back, he benched with legs up, knees at a 90, feet crossed. That&#39;s still how I bench, which isn&#39;t often. You get used to being real stable just from the hip and shoulder contact. Worked up to a 300lb bench at 175lbs bodyweight, it def hits the pecs a lot harder than keeping feet on the floor, but not all benches are stable enough to use it.</p>
