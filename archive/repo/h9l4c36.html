<div class="md"><p>I can get much more air in my lungs and much harder brace with zero weight on my back than I could with a barbell on it.</p>

<p>When I‚Äôm not doing singles I usually get 4-5 reps before I am done my first breath</p>

<div class="md"><p>Yes sir, I do as many reps as possible on that first breath and brace. Your brace will never be as good as it is unloaded</p>

<div class="md"><p>I admire your dedication and results. I have been working out since 15 years old, at 35 at this moment, and due to bad knees my current personal best sits at 425lbs (which is not as good as it could be for someone weighing 100kgs), with 485lbs deadlifts.</p>

<p>As you can see on the video of yours (and again, great stuff and well done), you do turn considerably red at 180lbs. Again, nothing to be worried about, it is just not a good common practice to hold your breath that long during exercise. Increased pressure can also pop a vein here and there, and start a brain aneurysm. Most usual is a loss of conciousness, which may get ugly with barbell on a bavk. Those steps you take while not breathing are taking the precious energy out of your lift.</p>

<p>But again, as a licensed trainer who got his license 10 years ago and not actively training anyone for 10 years, I refrain from giving any advice to obviously healthy individual like yourself. I do like your physique, your setup and technique.</p>

<p>Just breathe and be safe ü§ù</p>

<div class="md"><p>That‚Äôs great and all, but I don‚Äôt get light headed, I don‚Äôt pass out. I can easily hold my breath and get solid reps in. If something were to go wrong I have safeties in place. </p>

<p>You realize those are 45lbs plates on the bar and I‚Äôm saying my bodyweight is 195 correct?</p>

<div class="md"><p>You&#39;re a &quot;10-year licensed personal trainer&quot; and you don&#39;t yet understand the Valsalva method? OK</p>
