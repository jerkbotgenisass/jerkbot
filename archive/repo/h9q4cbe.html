<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Decided to graduate from bodyweight to weight training since the lockdowns eased up.</p>

<p>SS feels like too little, so I&#39;m more in the ICF camp.</p>

<p>I&#39;m hoping to get bigger instead of ending up as the skinny strong guy, so ICF appeals.</p>

<p>SS is more time efficient so that appeals to me some.</p>

<p>Which program would y&#39;all say is better?</p>

<p>Edit: I chose gzclp, thanks for your help</p>

<div class="md"><p>SS is 3x5. SL is 5x5. They both sorta suck. </p>

<p>ICF is a bit better but still runs into the same issues that the aforementioned do too. </p>

<p>5/3/1 for Beginners seems to be a better solution for most newbie trainees, but really dude anything will work. This is a program for the next 3 months, not the rest of your life.</p>

<div class="md"><p>What sucks about Starting Strength? The workouts aren’t long, it delivers exactly what it promises if you follow the program, and it’s arguably the most proven program out of every single one you’ve mentioned. 531 has beginners doing AMRAP sets which they have absolutely no business doing.</p>

<div class="md"><p><a href="/r/fitness">r/fitness</a> is an awful sub for strength training advice. Everything in that link is an out and out lie or a misrepresentation. The fact that volume on starting strength is being compared to Arnold Schwarzeneggers routine should tell you that the author of that article has absolutely no idea what the purpose of starting strengths or Arnold’s routines are.</p>
