<div class="md"><p>This takes considerable strength but a bad feat done well is still bad. </p>

<p>As a physical therapist who has spent a lot of time focusing on back pain, I would suggest against this move and have since I first saw it years ago. The forces going through the lumbar disks as you roll up from the floor to seated or when rolling down from seated to laying are magnified by the longer lever of having the weight overhead. I would hate for this to catch up to you and put you out of commission or cause a chronic problem. I may sound like a Debbie downer but I’ve seen many people in their 20’s and 30’s who move like they’re 90 because of a herniated disk. Power to you!</p>

<div class="md"><p>~1% of back pain is from herniated discs. 20-76% of randomly selected individuals have a herniated disc. And my favorite: <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/9209878/">in a double blind study 32% of individuals without any symptom of back pain were diagnosed with a herniated disc via MRI while 47% of homies with symptoms were diagnosed</a>.</p>

<div class="md"><p>Let’s be clear. “Back pain” is not even the issue. Herniations can cause nerve symptoms which are far worse than simple back pain. And most back pain is actually spasm which is intended to be protective. All that said, none of what you’ve shared contradicts what I said and I think you’ve missed the point. Either way the OP is free to do what he wants and clearly will. If he starts losing bowel and bladder control from an extrusion, it’s going to be a very bad day</p>

<div class="md"><p>LMAO, there’s nothing more ironic than kinesiophobia from a physical therapist. If you’re seriously thinking of cauda equina I’m going to think you’re not an actual physical therapist. The incidence of that is ~1/50,000-100,000.</p>

<div class="md"><p>Do you recommend people deadlift with a rounded lower back? Upper back is fine for the right folks, but lower back? Why not? If not, please explain why this is different. 
 Sure CES is rare and I’ve seen three times in 20 years but I’m really interested that you’re calling out kinesiophobia. There is an actual risk due to creep, compression, and shear forces. I’m not telling him to avoid movement or to be scared of moving. You do you but I’m trying to keep this guy from screwing himself, but I get it. Nobody asked the old man for his opinion.</p>

<div class="md"><p>You’re right, nobody asked you to fear monger. This is the epitome of a little information causing harm and I don’t care about your silly questions here. To suggest that this dude is going to have a medical emergency, which cauda is a medical emergency, because of doing this a joke dude.</p>
