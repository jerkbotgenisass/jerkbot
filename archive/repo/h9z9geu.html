<div class="md"><p>Very good topic of conversation, coincidentally enough I was banned from <a href="/r/gainit">r/gainit</a> a day or two ago for recommending starting strength. </p>

<p>Everything on that list is false, a fundamental misunderstanding of what Starting Strength is for, or simply ignorance of what is within the blue and grey books.  </p>

<p>The first point is the “lack of volume for muscle growth, especially long term”. A novice doesn’t need traditionally high volume to drive muscle growth. 3 sets of 5 at the high intensity that SS prescribes is plenty adequate for muscular growth provide diet is correct. Starting Strength is not a long term program either. It’s about 3 months long and that’s it. Maybe even less if you aren’t in a big caloric surplus or are already a heavier person. Neither is Starting Strength a long term program in the slightest. 3 months at most in the vast majority of cases. </p>

<p>A side note is that they recommend Arnold Schwarzenegger’s split for fucking beginners. This is, to me, the biggest indicator that <a href="/r/fitness">r/fitness</a> is an awful sub for strength training. You can do the routines that Arnold did all day long but that doesn’t mean you’ll get anything close to what Arnold did as results. </p>

<p>The next point is “t Rex mode”. All I’m going to say really is it’s not a thing. Lifters on <a href="/r/fitness">r/fitness</a> are probably used to not training legs so the newfound leg muscle is overwhelming. Notice how they argue there’s not enough volume for muscular growth but apparently your legs are growing enough to make you look like a T. rex. But alas, T. rex mode just  isn’t a thing and it never has been. </p>

<p>The point on stalls is just a blatant misunderstanding of its function. The stall could be due to accumulated fatigue from the aggressive programming. Deloading gives the lifter more time to recover and build back up to break through the previous plateau. It’s already established that if you keep stalling more than once or maybe twice then it’s time to move on to a new program. The program has done its job and maximized novice gains. Congrats, you are now an intermediate. Switching to a 3x3 allows the lifter to “peak” then switch back to 3x5. </p>

<p>4th point, the assertion that SS only emphasizes one aspect of strength is a misunderstanding of the program. How many times has Rip said that he is not training conditioning, cardio, work capacity or anything other than pure strength on that program? In PPST the authors go out of their way to inform the reader that the time for all of that is later after the novice program. It’s just not the goal of the program! And if the goal is to maximize strength in the novice phase then you shouldn’t program in conditioning or anything else. You can and for some people it will work but that is not the scope of starting strength and the strength gains will not be as much as following the program.</p>
