Banned for bringing a Discord Mod to account; who allows harrassment, bullying, and uses disgusting speech.

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>So.  </p>

<p>I was having a debate in the politics text channel.</p>

<p>I post an unpopular take; that there is an argument NOT to season beef burger patties. Depending on the quality of ingredients, condiments alongside it etc.</p>

<p>People laugh react at this for some reason? Which I see as bullying.</p>

<p>Then some clown screenshots this and starts posting it over and over again, which I find creepy. I @ supremecourt mods to stop this harrassing behaviour. I get kicked from the discord server. Fine. If you think harrassment like that is fine, so be it.</p>

<p>BUT</p>

<p>I then read the Mod&#39;s &quot;quip&quot; of me to &quot;get a life&quot;. Which I find very disgusting. I confront this mod in PM about their awful language and then pic related occurs.</p>

<p>How can I get banned from a server for merely questioning a mod&#39;s behaviour? Is this really what is acceptable? How power-tripping, Orwellian and faschistic of this mod to do this!</p>

<p>I find it so unfair they think they can keep throwing rude pot-shots at me, egging me on to defend myself, then when I retaliate against their aggression, they ban me.</p>

<p>How can doing @ Supremecourt &quot;incorrectly&quot; result in this?</p>

<p>How can someone just create a false dichotomy and spout lies at me and I am not allowed to defend myself?</p>

<p>Who does this mod think they are that they are some higher caste, and that the underlings cannot talk to them? Why not just block me and move on if it triggered them so much?</p>

<p>It all comes to this.</p>

<p>I have three demands:</p>

<ol>
<li>I am unbanned from the discord.</li>
<li>I get my rapsheet cleared.</li>
<li>I get a personal apology from this mod for their behaviour and unwarranted language.</li>
</ol>

<p>Failure of this will result in consequences. I will do whatever I can under the law until my demands are met. This is now going to be my life&#39;s work. I will not rest until I see justice for these transgressions.</p>

<p>The ball is in your court now, coward mod. By the way, I did send a ban appeal.</p>

<p>P.S. Brtish cuisine is based and top-tier.</p>

<div class="md"><p>lol, i unironically had a similar experience in <a href="/r/weightroom">r/weightroom</a>. where a mod was gaslighting me and basically saying &quot;accept these bullshit accusations (those guys are powerlifters, and they&#39;re a very strange cult that don&#39;t use the weightlifting standards and jargon of the rest of the bodybuilding world, then tried to mock and deride me for using terms/ standards that 90% of the lifting community uses), and then we can move on and u can stay here&quot;, and naturally i didn&#39;t, and he got mad and banned me after his insults fell on deaf ears. was simultaneously funny and infuriating at the same time haha. What kind of shitty life must one lead, to get their satisfaction from leveraging power on a fucking sub-reddit X&#39;D .  none of this should be so serious to get under anyone&#39;s skin, or we&#39;re using the internet wrong. That incident was a nice reminder to me, that &quot;whoa, i&#39;m taking this shit far too seriously&quot;</p>
