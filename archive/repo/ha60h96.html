<div class="md"><p>Yup. My 3 year old cousin decided to lift the end of a couch one day because he watched me (13) and my brother(11) move a love-seat for my grandmother. Doctors said he had 3 different hernias from doing it.</p>

<div class="md"><p>No, he had 3 different hernias that were revealed by lifting the couch.  They were going to present themselves sooner or later unless he lived in a bubble.</p>

<div class="md"><p>Iâ€™m just going by what the doctors said. You say that he already had the hernias and the lifting just showed that? You know once I broke my arm falling out of a tree. By your logic, my arm was already broken. The tree just showed the break. Got it!</p>

<div class="md"><p>This is a spectacularly stupid comparison.  You&#39;re not worth the typing it would take to explain how stupid you are. Really next level shit right here.</p>

<p>And, did you take your cousin to the doctor and hear this first hand or did you hear the explanation of an explanation of an explanation?</p>
