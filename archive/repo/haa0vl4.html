<div class="md"><p>I’m male, mid-30s, 5’9, currently 174lbs (79kg). I generally been skinny for most of my life. It has affected my mental health and my confidence growing up. I wanted to do something about it and stop living like this. Putting on muscle and weight is very important to me and I am very dedicated to being consistent and training as much as I need to each week.
 </p>

<p>I started training with a PT in March 2020, 2x sessions per week. The 2x sessions with my PT cost me $110 (USD) per week. In about late November 2020 I started to focus on my diet and add 100 calories every few weeks until I was at about 3400 calories and gaining weight (I weigh myself each day then get a weekly average).
 </p>

<p>I have no idea what the starting weight on my main lifts were as my PT was racking the weights and I didn’t ask what I was doing. As a rough guess from when I started going to the gym myself in October 2020 I would say my bench was 110lbs (50kg), deadlift 88lbs (40kg) and squat 55lbs (25kg). These weren’t really 1RM but more RPE8.
 </p>

<p>Now, August 2021, my 1RM numbers are: bench 143lbs (65kg), my deadlift is 176lbs (80kg) for 4 reps (never test 1RM) and squat 120lbs (55kg) approx. (but have no idea as haven’t been programmed these for months). Lately I’ve been given front squats to do and they are 110lbs (50kg). Split is an upper/lower split, 4x week.
 </p>

<p>I would like to know if my PT is worth sticking with or what I should do in this situation? This is very important to me so I need to get this right.
 </p>

<p>If you think I shouldn’t train with a PT anymore, it would be greatly appreciated if you could please recommend any programs. I’m mostly wanting to put on mass but also strength. Thanks</p>

<div class="md"><p>It’s always a good idea to reevaluate and requestion your program to make sure it is continuing to meet your goals. One question (and I may be stating the obvious, but it’s for discussion purposes): is your PT clear about your goals? You sound pretty clear in your comments, but wondering if the trainer understands. Second: is the trainer qualified to design a program to help you meet those goals? Not every one is skilled at designing a hypertrophy program. </p>

<p>Other questions: now that you have been lifting, how comfortable are you at going solo? There are three reasons why people use trainers: learning proper form, program design, and accountability. So are you knowledgeable about your form? Should be at this point. You have mentioned that you are able to stick to a routine. So there is program design—and that’s where it sounds like this trainer is falling short. </p>

<p>Based on all of that, I would conclude that: if you feel like you want to work with a trainer, you might need a new one, or at the very least have a blunt discussion with your current guy to share the concerns you have shared in this forum. If you don’t think it is a good fit any longer, then you want to find one that has the skill and knowledge to take you where you want to go. That can be a challenge. Second: if you feel comfortable working out on your own, and programming is the issue, there are plenty of programs in the wiki or elsewhere that you should be able to follow at this point. Maybe tell the trainer you need to take a break and try doing some things on your own.</p>

<div class="md"><p>Hi, I’d say if you feel you have mastered decent form for the main lifts, then you can ditch the PT to save yourself a lot of money. If you dont have a workout buddy, then just use safety pins on squat rack for bench&amp;squats, do this always!
Not only does it increase safety, but it lets you move the most weight you can whilst being able to go to failure if needed.</p>

<p>Your progress is seriously lacking too, did how often did you train? Seriously with that high kalorie intake and after such long time of training, you should be lifting way more.</p>

<div class="md"><p><del>I would not fully fault your PT there, your start and current numbers are awful and</del></p>

<p>Thinking about it, with your current weight you should not be emaciated. If you actually ear 3400 kcal, these results are atrocious. Did you never do any sports ever before? Physical job? Either way, you lift for more 1.5 years now and are far from underweight, yet you still have lower numbers than some beginners with your current stats. Do you do cardio? Are you healthy? How much protein do you eat? The PT sucks in either case and it is telling that they did not intervene or change anything.</p>

<p>Run 5/3/1 Building the Monolith, if you can&#39;t put on weight and strength that way, you need to get a medical checkup. I think for 440 bucks a month you could get some video coaching from Renaissance Periodization, Stronger by Science and some actual powerlifters who trained other powerlifters to new records, your PT ain&#39;t it.</p>

<p>I&#39;m pointing out that your hesitancy is why you&#39;re getting scammed for 440 a month. Its why you&#39;ve waited 1.5 years to ask and its why you&#39;re asking second a day in a row after getting a lot of feedback. It has nothing to do with intelligence.</p>

<p>That thread yesterday would have set in stone for me on what I would need to do.  Instead you&#39;re asking the same question again. I get you want the answer to be different to yesterday but I&#39;m saying it won&#39;t be.</p>

<p>I am being harsh because I don&#39;t think telling you its in any way acceptable to have made that progress would be helpful. That progress is bad and your PT is a scam artist.</p>

<div class="md"><p>Based on those numbers</p>

<p>My biggest concern is that I don’t seem to have a consistent routine set by my PT. For example, I can’t remember when I was last given back squats to do (maybe 2+ months ago) but has set me front squats on one of my leg days. He will sometimes take bench out and put in DB bench press. For the first 6-8 months we did not arm isolation lifts, as he said they would grow from doing compound lifts, and he eventually programmed them in for me to do by myself. He will also program exercises that make sense and I enjoy then weeks later they are subbed out for something else. I usually find myself ignoring some exercises in the blocks if I enjoy doing something or keeping something in that he has removed. He will also change up the reps and set an RPE that I don&#39;t like as there is no consistency, eg. this week he has me doing bench for 8 reps of RPE 8, whereas I prefer doing 5 reps.</p>

<p>You must communicate your concerns with the routine and the choices of exercises.  Have you asked what your trainer’s plan is moving forward?  You didn’t even ask for your starting weights?  If you don’t feel comfortable having these conversations perhaps a change is needed.</p>

For lack of a better term, these people have poor coordination.    You don’t progress weight until form has been mastered. This person has doubled their squats and deadlifts in 17 months.  And they are not injured.    That is positive progress. </p>
