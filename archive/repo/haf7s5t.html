<p>What do you mean lol</p>

<p>Also hypertrophy oriented training is generally shorter rest periods with a bit lighter weight and higher volume, so no I do not think widely spreading a workout throughout a day with long rests is the best course of action.</p>

<div class="md"><p>Rest times is a way to make sets more difficult but it isn’t the only way to induce hypertrophy and there is no clear indication it’s the best or most efficient.  Someone spreading their workout out could easily get enough volume in for good hypertrophy gains assuming the sets are of sufficient difficulty.</p>

<div class="md"><p>Because by any definition obtaining hypertrophy requires fatiguing the muscle and short rest periods.</p>

<p>Spacing a workout throughout the day will in no way sufficiently fatigue the muscles for any purposes regarding strength or hypertrophy. </p>

<p>I&#39;m not going to say you need to strictly do sets in the 8-12 range with 60-120s rest periods and that is the only way to obtain hypertrophy, but the <a href="/r/bodybuilding">r/bodybuilding</a> wiki, as well as their attached sources, say as much. Many independent studies have been conducted where the &quot;hypertrophy&quot; constant is high volume short rest periods. </p>

<p>All of this is just to say that you will in no way see optimal results in strength or muscle gain by spacing a workout over the course of a day, and that shouldn&#39;t really be debated but that&#39;s <a href="/r/fitness">r/fitness</a> for ya.</p>

<div class="md"><p>Can you help me find where on the wiki it says so about rest periods? I&#39;m unable to find anything mentioning rest periods from there. In Brad Schoenfeld&#39;s book <em>Science and development of muscle hypertrophy</em>, it says:</p>

<p>&#x200B;</p>

<blockquote>
<p>resting a minimum of 2 minutes between sets provides a hypertrophic advantage over resting for shorter periods at least when performing multi-joint free weight exercises. It may be beneficial to employ rest intervals of approximately 60 to 90 seconds for single-joint and perhaps certain machinebased exercises IF these movements do not show a reduction in volume load from shorter rest</p>

<div class="md"><p>Your answer is that no one with bodybuilding goals would even consider spacing a workout out throughout the day let alone taking 3+ minutes between sets.</p>

<p>3-5m rest periods are reserved for strength training.</p>

<p>You can check the rest of their sources or google some studies, though.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t know why it&#39;s so hard for you to grasp that spacing a workout over the course of a day is even less than sub-optimal regardless of the goal.</p>

<div class="md"><p>It&#39;s not hard for me to grasp. I&#39;m just hoping you&#39;d provide some sources for your statements. I haven&#39;t come across one source where it says it would be sub-optimal. What I&#39;ve come across is that if it helps you get more volume in, it&#39;s more beneficial.</p>
