I find myself getting fatter. Should I implement cardio in my routine?

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Besides work (job has a lot of walking and lifting) and the program minimum, I haven&#39;t been doing exercise. My protein goal each day is about 115 grams and my body weight is about 170. A week in to my training, I find myself getting fatter. I had this issue last time when doing &quot;Starting Strength,&quot; I got a lot stronger but gained a lot of fat as well. Would doing cardio in addition to kettlebells cancel out my progress? I know our bodies need time to recover. Just curious, if doing cardio is alright and does it matter if it is done before or after the workout (Like a an hour or two before or hour or two after)? Thanks.</p>

<div class="md"><p>Alright a bunch of things.</p>

<ol>
<li>No. Cardio will not kill your gains or cancel. I have maintained intermediate levels of conditioning and strength at the same time in the past, 500 Pound Deadlift + 6:52 2K Row is usually the two numbers I use here.</li>
<li>You can do cardio before or after, it really depends on what you&#39;re doing.  For most people it&#39;s probably better to do it after some rest though. You can rest for an hour+ before doing the cardio, it isn&#39;t necessary but a decent amount of rest between the two activities works best for me.</li>
<li>Don&#39;t do cardio for fat loss only, do it for your heart health. Fatloss is a product of what you eat more than how much cardio you do.</li>
<li>If you find yourself getting fatter, it&#39;s because you&#39;re eating over how many calories you burn in a day. I&#39;d recommend calculating your <a href="https://www.calculator.net/bmr-calculator.html">BMR</a> and COUNTING YOUR CALORIES. Since you work a physical job, try to eat 200-300 below that number and if the weight stays the same after a week, congrats, you found your BMR. If your weight drops, your BMR was probably accurate as calculated by the calculator. If your weight goes up, congrats, you figured out your BMR is lower than you assumed. Bump down another 200 and try again.</li>
<li>Don&#39;t buy into any fad diets if you find yourself getting a bit frustrated. Things like Zero Carb or Intermittent Fasting or Keto, the reason these diets &#39;work&#39; when they do is because the people doing them are eating at a calorie deficit. There is no magic here. Don&#39;t turn food into rocket science, eat like an adult, eat at your maintenance and reap the benefits of your hard work.</li>

<div class="md"><p>I just wanted to provide some input regarding Intermittent Fasting.  I know what the science currently says regarding weight loss from IF mostly being due to a caloric deficit, but that has not been my experience.  </p>

<p>I eat 2500-2600 daily and when I was not using IF I was slowly gaining weight.  However, when I use IF at 16:8 with the same caloric intake I lose weight.</p>

<p>So, yeah, I wouldn’t totally discount IF just yet as from personal experience there seems to be something to it.  And, sometimes science takes time to catch up.</p>

<div class="md"><p>There are many ways to explain what happened but 99% sure it has to do with some lifestyle change that coincided with the IF. The lifestyle change you’ve made could easily be that you are counting your calories more accurately now as opposed to before. </p>

<p>I’ve recently been eating 4000 calories a day for a week and today I woke up at 199.9 which is the same as 2 weeks ago when I was eating 2600 a day. </p>

<p>The thing that changed was not that my eating schedule has changed, instead my activity has rocketed alongside the intensity of my training since I moved to New York. I’m walking like 24k steps biking 9 miles most days and doing some form of interval or long form cardio on top of it and lifting around 1.5 hours most days. </p>

<p>I know it’s compelling when you see stuff like that happen, but there’s almost aways something else going on that’s not a magic diet thing. Trust me I wish there was. I would do it and recommend it for my clients if there was and it was healthy</p>

<p>Edit: to clarify a bit more, there’s nothing really wrong with IF like there is with carnivore or something, but I just don’t like beginners feeling like they need to do the optimal anything. Beginners think too much when they need to just eat less to lose or eat more to gain.</p>

<div class="md"><p>Nah.  I started counting calories when I was doing IF.  I decided to do an experiment for 4 weeks not doing IF, but keeping the same caloric intake and activity level. </p>

<p>So, I’m going to have to disagree.  Also, while the prevailing sentiment is that IF’s benefit is mostly due to caloric deficits there is conflicting studies out there so it’s not really “settled”… just commonly accepted.</p>

<div class="md"><p>You should submit your findings to a study because I think many would be interested in hearing how eating at a different cadence allowed your body to break the laws of thermodynamics :O</p>

<div class="md"><p>You seem charming.</p>

<p><em>”break the laws of thermodynamics”</em> - you might want to review your understanding of endocrinology before you make silly straw man arguments.  But, you are RKC certified so I’ll differ to your medical expertise…</p>
