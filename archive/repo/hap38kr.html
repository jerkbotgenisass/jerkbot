<div class="md"><p>My dead max is 465 and people who don&#39;t lift call me strong but then I look at my buddy who&#39;s 8 inches shorter and weighs 50 pounds less than me and can deadlift 550</p>

<div class="md"><p>On what planet is 465 DL not strong. Even among weightlifters.</p>

<div class="md"><p>465 would be a very decent deadlift for a woman.</p>

<p>But nothing remotely brag-able for a guy.</p>

<p>Unless we&#39;re talking kilograms and not pounds here...</p>

<div class="md"><p>It might not be &quot;Braggable&quot; within a group of dedicated powerlifters, but it would absolutely meet the bar of being &quot;strong&quot; among them. For a 180lb MAN, a 465lb Deadlift puts you in the ~90th percentile <em>of male weightlifters</em> at that weight.</p>

<p>So it&#39;s also absolutely braggable to not only the average person, but the average non-powerlifting weightlifter.</p>

<p>A 465lb Deadlift is also not a &quot;very decent&quot; lift for a women, it&#39;s for a lot of women probably genetically unobtainable without drugs.</p>
