I find myself getting fatter. Should I implement cardio in my routine?

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Besides work (job has a lot of walking and lifting) and the program minimum, I haven&#39;t been doing exercise. My protein goal each day is about 115 grams and my body weight is about 170. A week in to my training, I find myself getting fatter. I had this issue last time when doing &quot;Starting Strength,&quot; I got a lot stronger but gained a lot of fat as well. Would doing cardio in addition to kettlebells cancel out my progress? I know our bodies need time to recover. Just curious, if doing cardio is alright and does it matter if it is done before or after the workout (Like a an hour or two before or hour or two after)? Thanks.</p>

<div class="md"><p>You seem charming.</p>

<p><em>”break the laws of thermodynamics”</em> - you might want to review your understanding of endocrinology before you make silly straw man arguments.  But, you are RKC certified so I’ll differ to your medical expertise…</p>
