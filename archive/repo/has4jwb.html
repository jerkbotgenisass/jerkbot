<div class="md"><p>It’s a deadlift, if that extra 50lbs is anywhere above the knee it’s still weight he’s actively lifting.</p>

<div class="md"><p>Seriously though, with this terrible theory of yours how do you explain the lift consistently going up with body weight? According to you wouldn’t it be the opposite?</p>

<div class="md"><p>Go do a deadlift, then go do the same deadlift in a 50lb weighted vest. If you are a profession lifter with zero body fat and every bit of your weight is muscle specialized to lifting sure then your lifting is relative to your weight. I guarantee you a 90lb professional lifter can squat more than my fat ass that hasn’t been to a gym in 20 years. Just because someone weighs more doesn’t mean they can lift more, but yeah I can lift more than my 9yo so you must be right.</p>

<p>Extreme leanness isn&#39;t the trend for most powerlifters, especially in higher weight classes.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>This has more to do with practice and experience in the squat combined with strength than weight. It&#39;s not that you&#39;re fat (your words, not mine) you&#39;re just weak. Google &quot;Ray Williams&quot; then get back to me.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>True, but it&#39;s not just a &quot;weighted vest&quot; of fat. If we gave John Haack 20lbs of muscle and 20lbs of fat he&#39;d break his own records. Maybe not perform optimally to his competition in the weight class, but that&#39;s beside the point.</p>

<div class="md"><p>Real quick, lookup a push-up weight calculator put in your weight, then your weight plus 50 lbs. All I was saying is if I’m doing squats with just my body weight and suddenly lose 50lbs I’m now squatting 50lbs less.</p>

<p>I understand that. Some of that 50lbs might be muscle, however, and muscle can lift more than it weighs, if that makes sense?</p>

<p>Aside from push-up calculators online, I recommend looking at records for strength sports like weightlifting, powerlifting, strengthlifting and strongman.</p>

<div class="md"><p>Dude, not to be rude, but I don&#39;t know how not to, so please bear with me for a while:</p>

<p>You&#39;re admittedly weaker than a 90 lb person and haven&#39;t lifted in 20 years. Maybe you shouldn&#39;t have strong opinions on the matter.</p>

<p>When a person gains weight, it&#39;s usually a mix of muscle and fat. If you were to gain 30 lbs, and 20 of those pounds were purely fat, and the other 10 muscle, you&#39;d still have stronger lifts.</p>

<p>If someone training (aka the subject of the discussion at hand) gained 50 lbs while actively training, it&#39;s almost impossible for them to be gaining it all as fat. </p>

<p>The difference between OP&#39;s friend and OP&#39;s deadlift is because OP&#39;s friend is stronger. If you want to discuss causes for that, you can go for more experience, taking lifting more seriously, better conditions over time (food, sleep, lack of stress, etc), or any other of a myriad of factors, but being a lighter lifter is <strong>definitely not one</strong>.</p>

<div class="md"><p>For shit sake, I just came here to make one silly joke then someone took it seriously now I’m up three hours early on a Sunday arguing about things I couldn’t give half a shit about. Am I actually weaker than a 90lb professional lifter? I have no idea, again haven’t lifted a weight with a label on it in two decades. I had no opinion on the subject until someone that couldn’t take a joke assumed I did.</p>

<p>Yes, but not because they weigh less</p>
