<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I’m following the Reddit beginners 5/3/1 and today my friend convinced me to try his lifts and by the way I’m on the smaller side of dudes(6’1 183)</p>

<p>My training max for benching on the app(ultimate 5/3/1) is 150 but I managed to do 175. My deadlift is 250 up there but I managed to do 315. My squat there is 215 but I did 255.</p>

<p>Sometimes you gotta break from the program a little and experiment</p>
