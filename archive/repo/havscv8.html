<div class="md"><p>I was directly refuting your challenge of how people&#39;s lats look. YOU started the query about the aesthetics of lats. So... go for it. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>But how do their lats look?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>is a direct quote. They are your words. You can either accept that your question is bullshit, or show how your lats look. </p>

<p>Make a choice.</p>

<p>Cheers! :)</p>

<div class="md"><p>Thats a question. I asked how their lats look? Meaning i dont know what their lats look like but thats the pojt of this exercises so thats what i would look at. But no one i saw promoting this exercise said to do it like the guy in the video, i was under the impression that ppl are saying to throw the weight around uncontrollably and have a rounded back. I post an instructional video of the guy who this exercise was named after, he said to properly contract.</p>

<div class="md"><p>Hey.</p>

<p>Let&#39;s try this a different way.</p>

<p>Would you be OK with us starting over... completely from scratch? Like just two dudes who like to lift and want to start a new conversation about rows?</p>

<p>I think that would be the most productive way to move forward. </p>

<p>would you be ok with wiping the slate clean and starting fresh?</p>

<p>Cheers!</p>

<div class="md"><p>We can have a simple conversation just address my statement and stop name calling. I dont have any ill feeling either way, i just get sad that ppl need to interact in an argumentative way.</p>

<div class="md"><p>Okie dokie artichokie. :)</p>

<p>Then we can leave it at this... Your approach has gotten you to where you are. Feel free to stick with your opinions about &quot;form&quot; as well as your results. You can feel super glad about having the &quot;right form&quot;. You can stay on that path your whole life. You can even feel superior about how strict your rows are.</p>

<p>Then check my profile. </p>

<p>And then think up some other narrative, noj dude.</p>

<p>Cheers!</p>
