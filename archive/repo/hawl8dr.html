<div class="md"><p>I&#39;ve started taking karate lessons 3 times per week. There&#39;s a lot of push-ups, sit-ups and bodyweight squats involved. I was planning on just continuing my 4 day per week 531 schedule. This means I&#39;ll hit certain muscles twice per day or per two days, or 3 times in 3 days. I&#39;ve recovered quite well last week but want to check if it is a terrible idea to just see it through.</p>

<p>I&#39;d prefer going to a 2 or maybe a 3 day 5/3/1 routine if another sports has priority.</p>

<div class="md"><p>I&#39;ve trained in Shotokan karate for over 10 years and if there&#39;s one thing I regret, it&#39;s body building during the early years. I didn&#39;t realize how body weight-heavy karate was. Calisthenics and plyometrics are your friends. Regular decompression such as yoga is also beneficial because the amount of pressure one can build up from karate (extremely instructor dependent) can be a lot.</p>

<p>I&#39;m not too familiar with the 531 schedule but if it involves training with weights, I would personally avoid it.</p>

<div class="md"><p>At 68kg, 182cm I really want to put on some mass. It does involve training with (submaximal) weights. I&#39;m 34 years old, have no intentions to do anything competitive with karate. What was it that made you regret strength training?</p>

<div class="md"><p>I&#39;m saying that compared to what I did at the time, what I figured out later on probably could have worked better.</p>

<p>Don&#39;t let my personal opinion shape how you think you should be training. I&#39;m not a professional nor do I have your body type or mindset. If you think your plan works for you, all the power to your success.</p>

<div class="md"><p>You&#39;re not really answering the question. You were asked why you regretted strength training and you replied essentially indicating that you had very poor conditioning and mobility. This would imply that you think your poor conditioning and mobility resulted from strength training. Now you&#39;re saying that that&#39;s not what you were implying? Then why were you recommending avoiding strength training?</p>

<p>Trust me, your personal opinions will have zero effect on my training plan.</p>

<div class="md"><p>Strength training is a very broad area. There are many ways to obtain strength. Use of external weights (dumbbells, barbells, etc.) are one of them. I chose to use internal weights (parts of my body).</p>

<p>Yes, I regret the years of use of external weights for strength training for karate and personally do not think that that method of obtaining strength was for karate. Does that answer your question?</p>

</blockquote>

<p>No, it does not. Why do you regret it? Again, your initial answer to that question was that you had very poor conditioning and mobility, and when asked if you were implying that the weight training was what caused the poor conditioning and mobility, you dodged the question. Why do you regret training with &quot;external weights&quot;?</p>

<div class="md"><p>When running 4-day 531 variants, like BBB for example, you’re hitting the same muscles two days in a row. And on off days, for conditioning, lots of people do CrossFit WODs stuff, which will again hit the same muscles, but with less intensity. If you’re eating and sleeping well enough, and know when to dial back (if you have a karate lesson in the evening, maybe don’t go so hard on your 531 accessories in the morning, and maybe make your karate lessons an accessory to 531), you should be fine. Try it and see</p>
