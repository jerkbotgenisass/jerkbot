<div class="md"><p>Not at all. I don&#39;t feel there are much ethics to be had in this discussion in any capacity, nor do I consider an elevated pull to be a deadlift.</p>

<div class="md"><p>If a guy has shorter diameter plates and he elevates them to get the bar to the same heights as standard diameter plates, he is not deadlifting? Even though he is accomplishing the same effect?</p>

<div class="md"><p>I wouldn&#39;t consider that an elevated deadlift. The deadlift has a predefined starting height based on plate diameter. Getting the bar to that height would make it a deadlift.</p>

</blockquote>

<p>When you just finished competing on deadlifts, and the rulebook states that there is an acceptable margin of error for the bar handle diameter/plate diameter, do you leave with the possibility in your mind that you just completed an elevated pull instead of a deadlift?</p>
