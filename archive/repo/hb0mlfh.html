<div class="md"><p>What would you recommend deloading to?<br/>
A single barbell and a 30lbs dumbbell maybe?</p>

<div class="md"><p>In all seriousness tho, you should lower the weight somewhat until you can keep proper form and proper control over the bars throughout the movement. You seem to be jerking the weight a lot, which generally indicates that it’s too heavy. While I don’t personally like asymmetrical loading the way that you’re doing it, I’m not gonna critique that, since it seems you want to do asymmetrical loading but don’t have a whole lot of equipment to work with. If you’re concerned about my credentials, I’ve been lifting on and off for over a decade; I’ve been a wrestling coach for 6 years; both of my best friends were kinesiology majors in undergrad; one of them has also been a wrestling coach for 6 years, and is also 2 years into a 3 year PT program.</p>

<div class="md"><p><a href="/u/Jtop1">/u/Jtop1</a> needs to reign in that dangerous advice.  You need a broomstick and the uncut shaft of a 6&#39; d-pole.</p>

<p>I only specified that it should be uncut because some people cut it to their preference.  You know, for lacrosse.</p>
