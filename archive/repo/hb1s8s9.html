<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I’ve been trying for 3000 calories a day for the past two weeks. I feel sick. I’ve burped like 50 times in the past hour and my breath smells like protein powder. </p>

<p>On the upside my friends tell me I look bigger. But I don’t know how much more of this I can take. </p>

<p>I’ve been eating smoothies for breakfast (milk, banana, protein powder, oats, pb, coconut oil), chicken and quinoa for lunch, and take out for dinner (burgers and such). Then milk and protein powder before bed.</p>

<div class="md"><p>Because you need to develop the skill of simply eating more food instead of already resorting to tricks like smoothies.</p>

<p>The fact that you see them as meal replacement is the problem.</p>

<p>What are you gonna do when you&#39;re jacked at 100kg and you want to gain even more, make more smoothies?</p>

<div class="md"><p>Are you just going to eat bird portions and then drink progressively bigger smoothies for the rest of your life? I don&#39;t think it&#39;s a sustainable habit.</p>

<p>Instead you can learn to progressively eat more. It&#39;s a habit and a skill that can be developed and it&#39;s very easy to do so when you train hard, which is why the program party here was created.</p>

<div class="md"><p>Eating more makes sense, cooking more does not. Imo it&#39;s counterproductive to spend 1-2 hours per day on food prep, cleaning, shopping, etc.</p>

<p>I&#39;d recommend just eating out or smoothies. Supplement with sandwiches, nuts, fruit etc at home that has minimal prep and shopping needs.</p>

<div class="md"><p>All cooking is &quot;inefficient&quot;. That&#39;s why we have restaurants. I don&#39;t grow my own wheat, drill or refine my crude oil, weave my own clothes, build my house, or perform surgery either!</p>

<p>We live in a modern world of specialization. Sure.... I could weave my own clothes.... but at what cost? Unless you&#39;re a professional cook, it doesn&#39;t make much sense to cook for yourself (assuming you have no kids). You&#39;re paying a $5-$7 premium of food prep services, which would take 30-60 minutes at home, bare minimum. I definitely value my time above $5-15/hr.</p>

<p>I try to enjoy my life rather than oppressing it. I eat out, and supplement with smoothies, snacks, sandwiches, and salads at home. Yes, I am paying a premium for convenience, but what I pay is cheaper than what I would have lost (my time, or flavor). No one will make food as good as a restaurant, ceteris paribus (ie time). </p>

<p>I realize not everyone can afford an extra 5-15$ a day, but if you can, don&#39;t hesitate. There is no reward for suffering.</p>

<p>I realize you&#39;re a pro exerciser and I want to be upfront that I&#39;m not. But I also don&#39;t think everyone wants fitness to be their main hobby, let alone the primary focal point, of their lives.</p>

<div class="md"><p>It really isn&#39;t. Why don&#39;t you weave your own clothes? Why don&#39;t you grow your own food? Why rely on anyone for anything?</p>

<p>Again, we live in a world of specialization. Because, while it might be hard for our egos to admit, we aren&#39;t the best at everything and it often doesn&#39;t make sense to push something that isn&#39;t efficient relative to your next best option (opportunity cost).</p>

<div class="md"><p>Exactly. Someone else makes your clothes for you. And you realize that almost no one makes their own clothes in the general population, right? Just because you or i do something, does not mean it&#39;s generalizable to everyone.</p>

<p>Literally any cooking takes 60 minutes of prep, cooking, cleaning, minimum. Shopping not included. Here are a few things i&#39;ve made recently, after going back and trying to cook regularly again</p>

<ul>
<li>Spatchcock chicken over vegetables with farro</li>
<li>fried rice with veggies and tofu</li>
<li>steak with potatoes and green beans</li>
<li>Salmon/fish with stuff</li>
</ul>

<p>I usually spent more money/cal, got worse nutrition, wasted 1-2 hours, added in shopping trips, etc. when 2 smoothies in 2 minutes does the trick.</p>

<p>All this might work for you. I&#39;m just encouraging people not to cut off their nose to spite their face. Having 10 hours magically appear in your week is pretty incredible.</p>

<div class="md"><p>No offense but that omelette is disgusting. I&#39;d rather just eat normal food. I don&#39;t think everyone wants to put their body on high doses of sad food that costs as much as normal food, but you need to also shop, cook, clean, and eat in addition.</p>

<p>Whatever works for you - I&#39;m just saying some people find success with more moderation, because there are other parts of their lives - other hobbies, interests, responsibilities, etc.</p>

<div class="md"><p>You&#39;re making cooking into an unnecessarily burdening chore.</p>

<p>I shop after I come out of the gym then carry the groceries home. It&#39;s a 15 min walk. I do zero prep these days.</p>

<p>I make my breakfast omelette and sliced banana while my espresso brews. Less than 10 minutes. I wouldn&#39;t want to get dressed and go out for breakfast first thing in the morning and spend 5 times more money. I want to enjoy breakfast while I get ready for the day, in the comfort of my own flat.</p>

<p>Lunch took me 10 minutes to cook from scratch while I took a break from work and watched an instructional video that I finished while eating. Ground beef with sauce, cottage cheese and a banana.</p>

<p>Similar deal for dinner.</p>

<p>If I prepped my meals and had a microwave, &quot;cooking&quot; would take 3 minutes.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t know where you live but I can&#39;t afford the money and time to eat out every meal. It&#39;s also a matter of priorities. Having decent food is pretty high for me. Maybe you have the dough to eat in high class restaurants that use high quality ingredients. I don&#39;t so I buy those ingredients and make quick meals with them.</p>

<div class="md"><p>To say nothing of the quality control that comes with making your own food vs relying on someone else.</p>

<p>And when you factor in travel and wait time eating out, it doesn&#39;t even compare.  </p>

<p>We eat out for the fun of it, the social interaction, the yummy food.  The idea that it&#39;s less expensive and more convenient is just a way to justify poor decision making.</p>

<div class="md"><p>Yeah, I&#39;m not going to spend my life eating ground beef, cottage cheese and bananas. My meals aren&#39;t ridiculous - they&#39;re just actual meals, not food components. If we&#39;re going that route I&#39;ll just down a smoothie. I don&#39;t think ground beef and cottage cheese counts as cooking.</p>

<p>Eating out isn&#39;t cheaper per se - but it is if you value your time over $10 or $15/hr. for sure. Not everyone has that luxury, but many people also forget to include the value of their own labor and time. Why pay $6 and an hour for a meal when you could pay $12 and zero time?</p>

<div class="md"><p>No need to change the subject or create a strawman. Obviously a dinner party will not be hosted with smoothies. When you&#39;re dating someone, it can make more sense to cook together because they can take half the work and the cooking scales. Even then, as you say, you&#39;re not doing it for nutrition but socialization.</p>

<p>If you&#39;re cooking just for calories, don&#39;t bother. If you&#39;re cooking for other reasons, then it makes sense. But this is gainit and we were talking about eating for weight gain, not entertaining guests. That is <a href="/r/cooking">/r/cooking</a> or <a href="/r/culinary">/r/culinary</a></p>
