<div class="md"><p>My tip for you to improve your form is get your hands to be able to grip more. Use sand in a bucket and keep grasping it or something. I can see a possible problem that could be that its a bit hard for your hands to hold. I dont know for certain but... you can use any technique to make the press easier but it wont lighten the burden on your hands. For the rest you need to lower the weight down a bit otherwise you cannot train form. Once done its all good i guess and work up from lower to higher. You will be fine if you keep a eye out.</p>
