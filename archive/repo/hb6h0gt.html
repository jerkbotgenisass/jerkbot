<div class="md"><p>As a former fat boy who finally has a decent physique (visible abs, defined arms, finally got rid most of my love handles) for the first time in my life, it&#39;s so hard for me to mentally accept the fat gaining process of bulking. I&#39;ve been doing a &quot;lean&quot; bulk for the last few weeks and lately the scale has been jumping around quite a bit. I know most of those bumps are likely water weight (there&#39;s no way I&#39;ve gained 2 pounds in 1 week on a +300 surplus) but still, my irrational fear of getting fat again makes me freak out when I see that.</p>

<div class="md"><p>Why not do a smaller surplus? 300 is a lot, no? I don&#39;t think I&#39;d ever do over 100-150</p>

<div class="md"><p>My TDEE is ~2700 so it&#39;s a little over a 10% surplus, so not really too much for me</p>

<div class="md"><p>10% is a lot imo. My maintenance is about the same. Are you really really desperate to put on muscle quickly? Idk enough to debate the efficacy of bulking vs recomping at a slight surplus, but it&#39;s definite that the latter does work and you don&#39;t put on extra fat.</p>

<p>Since it seems to be bothering you a lot to put on the fat (and as a former fatty, I can relate), I&#39;d seriously ask if it&#39;s worth whatever advantage you&#39;re gaining by bulking is worth it to you.</p>

<p>It comes down to preference, I&#39;m sure, but don&#39;t feel obligated to &quot;bulk and cut&quot; just because people say that&#39;s the most effective way to gain muscle.</p>
