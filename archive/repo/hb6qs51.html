I see big guys at Planet Fitness. What is the problem?

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>To preface, I have been using a regular gym with racks for about a year now. I just took a little tour of our local Planet Fitness and I don‚Äôt understand the hate. For how cheap it is, there are so many machines available and it isn‚Äôt too crowded (at least in my area). But I also see plenty of jacked guys there, so why does everyone say to join a ‚Äúreal‚Äù gym? I know the number one reason is because there are no racks/barbells for squats, bench press, and deadlifts. But again, it seems like some guys are looking pretty big without that. Unless you want to be a legit bodybuilder or do olympic weight training, it seems like a perfectly fine option to build muscle?</p>

<p>Edit: lol it truly is a divisive subject I guess</p>

<div class="md"><p>must be new here, MythicalStrength is a long-time body builder with decades of experience under his belt. he spends his free time answering newbies questions in the sub, and i don&#39;t think he&#39;s ever purposely come across as a smart ass. his answers to things are just very straight forward and no bullshit. i can see how you would read them in a condescending tone, but just know he doesn&#39;t mean it :) have a great day my friend !</p>

<p>I disagree. Bodybuilding is a specific sport.</p>

<p>I would call them someone training for aesthetics, although from my understanding that&#39;s not even what MS trains for.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>It&#39;s not pro Vs ammy. It&#39;s doing a thing Vs not doing a thing. Someone who does not compete in bodybuilding, does not plan to compete in bodybuilding, does not train like a bodybuilder and is not aiming to look like a bodybuilder is not a bodybuilder.</p>

<p>I&#39;d just call them a trainee personally.  For myself, I&#39;ve competed in powerlifting and strongman, and being bigger and stronger tends to be my focus.  I do appreciate the sentiment behind the words though, and when I get called a bodybuilder I don&#39;t correct people.  I take it as a compliment, haha.</p>

<div class="md"><p>They are often purposefully vague so that the person has to ask a follow-up question. Some kind of attention seeking or trolling thing. Often they are just downright condescending/patronising. Also, considering they were 150lbs as a not overly tall high schooler (if I remember their background correctly) and had their meals made for them in the beginning of their gaining journey, they lack a true understanding of what many people trying to gain weight from an underweight position are going through and this is clear to see in their often ignorant comments. Obviously this person knows about gaining strength and size and often shares helpful materials but definitely lacks an understanding of the place true skeletons are coming from and seems that the adulation on here has gone to their head a bit.</p>

<div class="md"><p>I was 6‚Äô2‚Äù and less than 150lbs. I find his advice to hold true to my ‚Äútrue skeleton‚Äù experience. </p>

<p>The problem that I have seen some people have with his comments is that they are actually very non-vague in a world where people often add a lot of qualifiers to their statements. So people assume that there is more to read into his comments than there is. They also often assume that because he commented something brief that he is baiting someone to ask for a longer explanation when I‚Äôm fact he is saying exactly what he means. </p>

<p>Now you can argue that sometimes this non-common method of communication on Reddit is not as helpful as it could be and I would agree. However I would also counter that he is free to communicate however he sees fit and due to his tenure of posting on lifting subs, not just here but elsewhere, he probably has a better grasp of effective communication on a forum. And also he could simply not care and that is perfectly valid. He gains nothing from his posts other than maybe some serotonin from knowing he helped someone and a dozen hits to his free blog.</p>

<p>Lastly, there is one thing I think people who mainly just see his posts here have come to believe and that is the idea that everyone just agrees with everything he says and does. In reality that couldn‚Äôt be further from the truth. There are plenty of things he says or thinks that other very strong knowledgeable people disagree with and it often leads to very interesting discussions. The main takeaway being that frankly if you try really hard for a long time, whatever style of training you do will work.</p>
