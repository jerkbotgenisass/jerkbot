	<title>Want to improve chest & shoulders, feel like my pecs look weird and under developed same with shoulders. I do bench press variations (incline,flat,decline) and dumbbell flies but that’s all for chest. For shoulder I do shoulder press with dumbbells. What can I do for chest split and big shoulders?</title>

<div class="md"><p>I am going to come at this as a physique competitor where the aim is wide shoulders tapering to waist. You need a more robust program to get the results that you want for both chest and shoulders. Shoulder press isn&#39;t bad, but if that is the only thing you are doing for shoulders, your body will get used to it over time and you will see diminishing returns. I recommend changing your routine every 4-6 weeks. My shoulder work changes, but it usually is comprised of DB front and lateral raises, rear delt flies (DB, cable or machine), shoulder presses, push presses, DB pullovers (several variations). That work is often reinforced with other work that engages the shoulder (chest and back). </p>

<p>What guys really are looking for is to become the upside-down triangle, but they often do all the wrong exercises. Trap-specific exercises are a good example of that. Large traps take away from the definition of the shoulders and lats. If you were trying to highlight your shoulders, I would not train traps. </p>

<p>Chest is a mixed bag. It takes a lot of work to get the volume if you do not have it already, but genetics plays a big part, too. I would add in chest dips, pushups, weighted pushups, incline press machine (turned to the side and pressing across the the front of the body outd up). How you do the work matters with chest. Make sure you have good flexibility in the shoulders to increase your bench depth and activate the entire muscle.</p>
