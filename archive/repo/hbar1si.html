<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Just want to know peoples opinions on sumo deadlifts? I don’t really see the point in doing them over conventional deadlifts in regard to strength training.</p>

<p>Just wondering because I’ve seen a few videos of people doing them on this sub and others.</p>

<div class="md"><p>They are stupid. People do them for three reasons: They don’t know how to do a real deadlift. They are scared of real deadlifts but want to say they deadlift. Or they are competitors. Competitors use them because the wide leg stance reduces the range of motion; therefore it’s less distance the bar has to travel to be considered a complete rep in a competition. It makes sense in a competition that allows it if your sole motivation is to win. </p>

<p>But, precisely because there is a reduced range of motion, means it doesn’t work as much muscle mass over the longest range of motion. Therefore, it is suboptimal for STRENGTH training. The people who post them here have not read the book, and have never heard of the program. They probably just had Reddit’s algorithm feed them this channel due to other related subs they subscribe to.</p>
