<div class="md"><p>I know what it is and what muscles it activates over RDL, traditional, and trap bar. I also know how each affects your shear forces on your back and why one may be better than the other for your height or flexibility.</p>

<p>Sumo is considered a beginning lift if you lack lower back strength and it’s a good way to progress into the aforementioned which are more athletic and natural lifts. The reason I said idk is because the only benefit of sumo at powerlifting levels is for PR.</p>

<div class="md"><p>If sumo is cheating to put up more weight, don’t you think all high level powerlifters would pull sumo? Or do you think that maybe it’s better for some people while conventional is better for others?
Your first comment was nonsense about injury risk. There is no higher risk for back problems regardless of which stance you choose.
Also, sumo is not considered a beginner lift by any powerlifting coach or high level lifter. I think you’re way out of your depth on this. Just to confirm: how much do you pull?</p>

<div class="md"><p>Go read the science about it. You seem misinformed. In addition to my above comment there are body anatomy reasons why sumo over conventional may be better for each person but that’s not my point. My point was that a sumo deadlift is basically a front squat. Squats don’t load your lower back nearly as much as conventional deadlift. Calling it a sumo deadlift is kind of a misnomer IMO. I can pull 2.5x my body weight</p>

<p>You first.</p>

<p>What in the fucking fuck are you actually talking about? Are you high? That&#39;s just a ridiculous claim.</p>

<p>You lift the weight from a dead stop in front of you until you are standing up with your back straight. It&#39;s a deadlift.</p>

<div class="md"><p>People dont seem to realize that like all the world record and 1000 pound deadlifts are done conventionally.</p>
