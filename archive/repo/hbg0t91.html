Muscles are vanity, strength is sanity.
Breathe, move, lift, press...often.

<div class="md"><p>Oh I was totally serious. I know you can get strength with barely any muscle hypertrophy due to an improvement on the neural connections, but this has a limit. Sooner or later to get strong your muscles must get more powerful and they‚Äôll grow (number and size of fibers).</p>

<div class="md"><p>Cool. Principally &quot;cells which fire together wire together&quot;. In essence that is neiro-plasticity in a nutshell. This why isokinetic exercise gains strength faster than isometrics which, in turn,  is faster than what 99%of us do; isotonic.  Always good to raise a query...we all need our little checks in place. Good luck to you sir!</p>

<div class="md"><p>Thank you for the reminder.  I&#39;m trying to get back into being in shape and realizing, at my age, the point is function over form. I spend the bulk of my workout time on stretching, mobility, and posture work.  And i&#39;ll be damned if it isn&#39;t actually producing results.   I feel like I&#39;m getting more done with less now that my body is working as it should. I&#39;m also focusing on loaded carries and basic kettlebell movements, which workout EVERYTHING in ways that I haven&#39;t felt before.</p>

<div class="md"><p>Time under tension is the bedrock. That&#39;s why yoga is so effective...really long isometric holds. Just keep going. I&#39;m two years into calisthenics and I&#39;m still an embryo at it.</p>

<div class="md"><p>Think of it this way - muscle size is <em>potential strength. Muscular contraction</em> is where true strength lies. Muscles that are not trained to contract intensely hard in a coordinated fashion will lose to those that are..</p>

<div class="md"><p>I would say may instead of must. It kinda comes back to how much of our brain do we use. In muscle strength, how much of your nervous energy can you muster to contract the muscle? If you can generate 100%, then I would say the muscle must grow larger to gain strength.  I think that would take years of training to get to this level of intensity.</p>

<div class="md"><p>Size has nothing to do with strength!  I knew a woman who weighted 104, was about 5&#39;2&quot;, and could squat 6 plates no problem.  there are lots of people who would surprise you with how normal they look and are freaking strong!  The No. 1 source of strength is your mind. Your willpower.  Knowing how to apply strength across joints, coordination, and experience are also large sources of strength.</p>

<div class="md"><p>I dunno. Two guys in a bar were trying to move one of those ridiculous wood tables with the heavy stump legs out from the bench so they could fit better to sit, they weren&#39;t meat heads but reasonably fit and really struggling. My best friend is 5&#39;4, a bit heavy set (max 160lbs) but she pulled it out with one arm easily, it slid. We were all shocked! She said she&#39;s always been freakishly strong, that said she&#39;s a geriatric nurse so probably does a lot of awkward lifting day to day!</p>

<div class="md"><p>Some physiques are deemed ¬´¬†not muscular¬†¬ª even if they have a huge amount of muscle mass. Middle-aged guys with lot of muscle mass but a little bit of fat and no definition on the ¬´¬†beach muscles¬†¬ª (pecs and abs) are often considered not muscular by the average population. OP is very likely in this case with 20 years of lifting, strong glutes, back, forearms, core but not the shape promoted in magazines today.</p>
