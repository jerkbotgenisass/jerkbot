(NB/5'11/175lbs) Advice! Should I increase my calories?

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Hi guys! I&#39;ve posted my weightloss journey here regularly for the past year. </p>

<p>Currently, I average about 1700 kCals and 100g of protein daily. I eat a vegan diet, so I have pea protein, beans and rice, tofu, seitan, etc, as protein content. </p>

<p>Through the bulk of the pandemic, I always had energy to lift and rarely had to leave the house. The result? Lifting as late as 11pm. </p>

<p>Nowadays I prioritize sleep. My average nights rest is about 6.5-7 hours. Great Change from my old average of about 5 hours a night, and definitely a goal I had to work towards. </p>

<p>However, I have little to no energy. Life has returned to relative normalcy here. I&#39;m on campus about 8-10 hours a day 5 days a week, plus a 2 hour commute time, and on campus 3 hours a 6th day a week for meetings. I average 10k steps without much effort, and spend much more time lifting, moving, and generally just being physically active at work. My backpack is usually between 20 and 35 pounds, including laptop, lunch, water bottle, textbooks, etc. I log all active minutes and steps weekly just by going about my usual routine. </p>

<p>After getting back into in person work and class, I&#39;ve unintentionally tapered off of exercise. I&#39;m losing around 2 pounds a week now without exercise, but the going is incredibly slow. How should I adjust my diet?</p>

<div class="md"><p>I think you’re projecting a bit dude. I’m not offended that you relied on a crash diet. Do whatever works for you. You’re the one arguing with all the advice people are giving you so I think maybe you’re a bit sensitive about it. </p>

<p>Anyway the incredibly obvious thing to do, which I already said, is to add back some calories to see if it helps. More specifically I’d switch to however many calories changes you from 2lb to 1lb a week. </p>

<p>Also I’m gonna assume you’re such an asshole because you’re miserable because cutting sucks. If not you should work on that</p>

<div class="md"><p>I&#39;m not arguing with anyone. Well, I suppose besides you. </p>

<p>Stating that my situation is unique and certain advice doesn&#39;t necessarily apply isn&#39;t an argument, I am incredibly grateful for all input I&#39;ve received. It&#39;s just that arguing losing 5 pounds shouldn&#39;t be a big priority is different between someone just bulking and someone cutting to lose fat for cosmetic reasons regarding loose skin, for instance. </p>

<p>I fully acknowledge I should eat more, but I&#39;m more discussing in what way I should be reaching that goal. Dieting and building muscle is never as simple as just adding back calories. Macros matter. Does going from 1700 one day to 2200 another day matter, or will the difference still cause similar levels of fatigue? Etc etc. </p>

<p>Additionally, a lot of advice I receive are things I&#39;ve already used along the way for weightloss (TDEE, muscle burning alongside fat during weightloss, etc). </p>

<p>You&#39;re the one who put words in my mouth in response to my comment. You seem concerned enough to be insulting me when you&#39;re the one who led in being argumentative.</p>

<p>Actually it usually is. Having low energy and being on a very steep cut is not that unique of a situation. </p>

<p>This is impossible to answer which is why you need to try it and see if it helps. If it doesn’t you haven’t lost anything in the grand scheme. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>macros matter</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Not as much as you think they do especially in this situation. Personally I would add carbs in because it will be easy and carbs are easy energy. </p>

<p>You seem to be vastly over complicating and thinking something that is almost certainly a very simple problem. You have been cutting for a while very steeply and now your energy levels are low. The obvious and easily testable solution is to just add back some calories and see if it helps. </p>

<p>Alternatively you could lean harder into caffeine.</p>

<div class="md"><p>Macros matter to me more because I shifted to a vegan diet. It isn&#39;t as simple as just adding more. Carbs, protein, those are things to prioritize for energy and for muscle building. Veganism opens its own can of worms in terms of what I&#39;m balancing correctly to avoid a deficiency. </p>

<p>My situation is unique as in I shifted from a normal diet to a vegan diet, and I&#39;m trying to reach an end goal weight while grappling with loose skin. Cutting and trying to figure out ways to improve loose skin isn&#39;t easy, ultimately I&#39;ll probably be getting a minor surgery. Generally, it would be best to finish cutting or to start bulking, but I need to tailor my cut to finish it. </p>

<p>However, I want to minimize fat and build muscle long before that. Add too much, I gain weight. Add too little, I don&#39;t solve my problem. There aren&#39;t many options that would easily fit within a 400-600 calorie window on a vegan diet they would genuinely aid in adding both carbs and protein, while also avoiding adding too much fiber. </p>

<p>&quot;Impossible to answer&quot; is a wildly arbitrary statement in a discussion that has ample room for anecdotes from those with similar experiences. </p>

<p>Sure, it&#39;s testable. But I value seeking advice before making major decisions which might impact my weightloss/muscle gain. I saw linear progress in my lifting for some time, but much of that was halted by my diet change. My diet change has to do with a food allergy and has been a crucial step for improving my quality of life. I eat a comparable number of calories to pre-veganism, but the feeling of fatigue really heightened post-veganism, followed by a destabilized work-life balance with everything reopening. According to my calorie tracking, at my lowest I&#39;m only 10% less than before with some nutrients (like iron). So really, I&#39;m not sure what could be having such a dramatic effect.</p>

<div class="md"><p>But your adding calories in not taking them away so it doesn’t matter a ton what the macro spread of them are. </p>

<p>Adding back some calories isn’t a “major decision” it’s a quick and easy way to see if it stops your problem. </p>

<p>I was vegan for 10 years and had no issues. It’s not really that hard to get what you need. </p>

<p>The dramatic effect is most likely increased activity while operating at a steep deficit. The solution is most likely eating slightly more to account for it.</p>
