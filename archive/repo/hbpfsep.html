<div class="md"><p>Good spot. Do you think these are not legit plates? The fact that he has happy feet and can still rep 315 for 5 is kind of sounding the alarms. I don&#39;t know how you get there with that sort of technique. </p>

<p>Obviously accusing Simone of frauding with fake plates isa big callout, but this just seems fishy. </p>

<p>The other thing to note is that the bar just doesn&#39;t look like it&#39;s loaded with 3 plates based on how it moves. Also kind of suspicious that we don&#39;t see the re-rack, which would show us how the bar oscillates. Any one else feel the same?</p>

<div class="md"><p>This is such a shit take. There are a lot of plates in that background the same as OP is using, are you seriously suggesting he brought in ~20 fake plates to trick people with a lmao3pl8 bench?</p>

<div class="md"><p>I am 100% guaranteeing he is using fake plates and I don’t care what the plates in the background look like. This is just a fake video in every way.</p>

<p>Larry Wheels wouldn’t make 315x5 with no leg drive or arch look this easy.</p>

<div class="md"><p>He wouldn’t move those first reps this easily. The dude in this video is a bad actor. You’re 100% an asshole for no reason on a topic you know nothing about though.</p>
