<div class="md"><p>I actually think in a weaponless fight these people would be fairly easy to defeat with even a rudimental level of skills in boxing and wrestling. </p>

<p>How many king fu experts are winning UFC titles?</p>

<p>What they do looks awesome on stage or in a circus, but totally impractical in a real fight.</p>

<div class="md"><p>Many martial arts techniques are banned from UFC for what theyre used for. You cant use a martial art technique in a mma sport thats solely taught for killing other people and violates all the rules of a UFC fight. Bjj, and all that is amazing and effective. I currently practice judo and I love it, but dont discredit shaolin kungfu. </p>

<p>Now now dont get me wrong, theres a lotta mcdojos throwing goofy stuff out and shaolin kungfu isnt sparred traditionally because people can get really hurt. In my opinion sparring is half your training and experience, but a rudimentary MMA fighter and or boxer (less experienced) will absolutely get their shit wrecked by an experienced shaolin kungfu fighter that has fights/practical experience under their belt.</p>

<p>Edit: I agree theres better arts that are far more practical for the common person. However, i just have mad respect for other arts and believe we shouldnt be so quick to discredit others.</p>

<div class="md"><p>Martial arts were invented for the intention of killing other human beings. Martial arts evolved to fit into sport as it passed down from different generations depending on the art. Some arts did not and either went via completely different routes and various techniques are forgotten as they become obsolete. Some arts like the aforementioned or krav maga along with others are used in militaries around the world since periods from a long time ago or more recently because they are effective at killing your enemy. Im not saying either is superior to one another in any way, but all im saying is that there are arts that focus much more heavily on lethal techniques as opposed to others that are less lethal. Less lethal =/= less effective. I would say that banning a technique from some of these arts for being more &quot;unsportsmanlike &quot; is probably  more accurate than saying an art so i apologize if i pressed any confusion from that.</p>

<div class="md"><p>Fair enough. To reply to your other comment as well, the UFC rules don&#39;t stop you from using &quot;lethal&quot; strikes as long as they don&#39;t contravene the rules like gouging the eyes, stomping on the head, kicking the balls etc.</p>

<div class="md"><p>If that was true then the UFC wouldnt ban various martial arts techniques. Theyre not banned because they&#39;re dumb, theyre banned because theyre dangerous for a reason. Im not saying any average kung fu/other art practitioner can take a seasoned fighter, however anyone who has experience in real fights and uses those arts or anything similar stands a chance to inflict major injury to someone. Would it be nonsense in most scenarios? Maybe, especially because most average people who practice these either dont actually fight, they go to a mcdojo, or both. However, for the practitioners who have had plenty of fights, they can and will hurt someone; that is for any vetted art.</p>

<div class="md"><p>The whole &quot;banned because they&#39;re so dangerous&quot; concept is just not real lol.</p>

<p>There are no style specific bans in pro mma. There also aren&#39;t many techniques banned from professional MMA and those that are certainly didn&#39;t originate in any form of kung fu. Things like super precise dim-mak style one-touch neck strikes also don&#39;t really work when the other person is punching you in your face. They look cool against a wooden pole that&#39;s not moving or doing anything at all to prevent you from looking pretty, but that&#39;s about it.</p>

<div class="md"><p>That’s more of a case that America has millions of boxers and wrestlers and maybe a few thousand kung fu fighters. A lot of martial arts can be viable as long as you integrate actual sparring and fight practice in it. Cung Le was a pretty decent ufc fighter for his time and he practices Sanshou, which is like the full contact version of Kung Fu they teach to the Chinese military. Its not uncommon to see Wushu or Sanshou fighters in Asian MMA promotions.</p>

<div class="md"><p>I’ll agree that Kung Lee was awesome to watch, don’t think he was ever quite top tier, but entertaining as hell and a very capable fighter.</p>

<p>I’m a die hard martial artist I really am, and on some level it pains me to realise that a boxing/ wresting combination likely defeats all TMA, but I’m not the first to think it, Bruce Lee saw the light himself.</p>
