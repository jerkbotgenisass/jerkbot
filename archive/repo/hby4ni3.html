<div class="md"><p>I&#39;ve been following a program basically the same as starting strength/stronglifts 5x5 that was given to me by a trainer. It worked well for around 4-5 months and I have doubled all of my lifts. Now I&#39;ve come to a complete stall on everything and the harder I push myself the more I seem to go backwards.</p>

<p>My lifts are still very low (although my starting point was probably lower than most) so I don&#39;t think I am at the end of linear progression yet: Bench 50KG, OHP: 37KG, DL: 90KG. These are all 1RM.</p>

<p>I&#39;ve been eating at around maintenance and have seen absolutely no physical change in my body, although my body fat is around 20% so that could be why. Should I try bulking for a bit? I&#39;ve read that these type of novice programs aren&#39;t about building muscle and bulking will just get you fat, so maybe I should change to a program with periodization like 5/3/1 instead? I feel like it&#39;s too soon for that though.</p>

<p>I&#39;m 37, 5&#39;10 and weigh 73KG.</p>
