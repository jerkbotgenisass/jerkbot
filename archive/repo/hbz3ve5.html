<div class="md"><p>Here is a tip before you fuck yourself. Do not do bro splits!!!!  I squat everyday and I do push beginning of the week and pull end of the week. Do not go to the gym and train arms, then legs next day, then back next day, then shoulders etc. thats retarded and it is what everyone does at the gym. Do push/pull days no bro body splits. If you want to do the bro split method, then do it, but that is not a good program to run at all. Bro splits are for people who do not know how to train</p>

<p>Edit: of course it gets downvotes. Cause the people that down voted are pussies and do bro splits</p>
