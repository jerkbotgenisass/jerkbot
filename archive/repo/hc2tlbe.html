<div class="md"><p>He did it without his feet planted on the ground, he could probably put up more with solid form.</p>

<div class="md"><p>Having worked with people with disabilities for many years I will tell you that this is a real problem people need to be aware of. This feet is an impressive lift but that’s a lot of weight on joints without proper form. The other thing is people like this LOVE to be people pleasers and will down play injuries or pain because they get so much positive attention when they do stuff like this. </p>

<p>So yes let’s get this man some form training and in general let’s continue to encourage and reward proper form and not the number.</p>

<div class="md"><p>My wife&#39;s special needs uncle used to go to the bar in his town and asshole college kids would see how much they could get him to drink because he&#39;d just keep on drinking beers when he saw how much it made the assholes laugh and smile when he&#39;d chug one.</p>

<p>He&#39;d do the same with spicy foods and peppers. Just keep slamming hotter and hotter peppers because it made people smile. FFS gang, he has the disability and y&#39;all are the ones too stupid to treat him better.</p>

<p>He&#39;s in better care now.</p>

<div class="md"><p>Ugh I hate hearing this but it happens all the time. High school was rough for my cousins for this reason. Luckily now a days kids are much more understanding and compassionate. </p>

<p>It really sucks too because my cousins are the absolute best! I LOVE going to breweries with them and “being fancy” when we get a flight of beers. But it took a lot to get them to understand to drink beer because YOU like the taste and to enjoy it, and not for others enjoyment. I was very proud the first time we went and my one cousin said that he wasn’t really feeling a beer today and just wanted to play board games and try a new food truck. (He had a lemonade and an ice tea).</p>

<div class="md"><p>Idk what y’all are on about improper form, do you see bros elbows? Locked the fuck in, you can’t lift weight like that without having your shoulder blades retracted and elbows screwed in like that. Yeah his feet were off the ground, but people’s form is known to break down a bit when you’re benching 1.5x your body weight.</p>

<div class="md"><p>This. There used to be a mentally challenged guy that went to the pool my grandparents would take us to when we were little. He would repeatedly climb up on the 10&#39; diving board and proceed to do the loudest, most painful sounding belly-flops I&#39;ve ever seen and heard. I was watching him do it one day and my grandma scolded me for doing so and told me the only reason he&#39;s hurting himself repeatedly is because it gets people&#39;s attention and makes them laugh. Of course she was right but until then I was too young to realize it. I had such great grandparents and I miss them every day.</p>

<div class="md"><p>“Form” isn’t as important as you think. The body will adapt to stress. Our bodies didn’t evolve to lift a barbell, they adapt to movement patterns over time. If you’re interested in keeping them safe from injury, you should be more concerned with variables like sleep, diet, and load management over the long term</p>

<div class="md"><p>Well no it&#39;s true. He didn&#39;t get to benching 350 because his form sucks. Maybe retracting and arching is too difficult to maintain so he did what worked for him. Perfect control and balance, and all I&#39;d worry about is shoulder impingement from an overly flared elbow, which he doesn&#39;t have.</p>
