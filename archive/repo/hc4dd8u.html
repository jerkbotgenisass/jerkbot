<div class="md"><p>Alright, I go to Gold&#39;s Gym in Japan. To drum up business they&#39;ve been offering aerobic (types of) classes to attract &quot;housewives&quot; and older people, especially for the morning and afternoons. Membership soared with COVID (presumably, to get healthy but also people have nothing to do) and it just pisses me off. </p>

<p>What was once 95/5, male/female split is now closer to 60/40 which is an issue when an elderly woman or housewife gets into the squat racks to deadlift the bar. </p>

<p>There&#39;s a uni nearby and their rugby and soccer team t r i e s to train there, and everyone is nice about it, but it&#39;s really frustrating when the spot you need to be is occupied by someone barely doing weight, doing the worst possible form, or chatting -- oh the chatting. </p>

<p>On the weekends some housewives bring their husbands. It&#39;s cute -- you get these really big guys benching 200kg sandwiching a couple trying to figure out how to do bench press -- but frustrating.</p>

<div class="md"><p>Oh no, not older women in the squat racks!</p>

<p>For a dude who was asking a Belt 101 question a week ago, you sure have a lot of opinions on new lifters.</p>

<div class="md"><p>It&#39;s supposed to be a rant thread, didn&#39;t realize we were gatekeeping here. And good memory -- or too much free time, keep those gates secure.</p>
