<div class="md"><p>1) You don&#39;t need cutting and bulking phases. That&#39;s broscience and a waste of time. The extra muscle you build while bulking will be lost when you go into your more aggressive cutting phase. For a deeper dive into this topic I recommend Greg Doucettes youtube videos. He has a bunch on this topic.</p>

<p>2) In the beginning everything works. It&#39;s called newbygains.</p>

<p>3) For me personally your routine contains way too much cardio but if you like that it&#39;s fine. Just make sure to not get into too big of a deficit. As a beginner I&#39;d gravitate more towards a full body 3x a week schedule. Beginners usually benefit from higher frequency of given exercises and can rarely handle the high volume that comes with split routines. </p>

<p>Even if you decide to stay on a split it seems somewhat awkward to me. A Push / Pull / Leg split might be exactly what you are looking for. No need for extra &quot;ab-workouts&quot;. Just do a core circuit at the end of every workout. The most effective exercises are hanging legraises (with your back against the wall), obliqueraises, reverse hyperextentions and hollowholds. </p>

<p>And please do yourself the favour of informing yourself about the cutting and bulking myth. It will safe you lots of time and frustration.</p>
