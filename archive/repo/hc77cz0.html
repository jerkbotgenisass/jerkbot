<div class="md"><p>Thank you for mentioning roids. Surprisingly, a lot of people still believe the rock and hemsworth are all natty - they’re not!</p>

<p>There’s even gonna be a reply saying im wrong, guaranteed. Yoyoing that much weight that easily and that lean is possible only on certain sauces.</p>

<div class="md"><p>You cannot achieve transformation this quick without roids. But Lots of people think you just take roids and get big. It&#39;s a fuckton of work when ur cycling. And the amounts u need to eat are unreal</p>

<div class="md"><p>The study: They randomly placed 43 normal guys into 4 different groups. These groups were:</p>

<p>Placebo (natural) with no exercise</p>

<p>Testosterone steroid (injection) with no exercise</p>

<p>Placebo (natural) plus exercise</p>

<p>Testosterone steroid (injection) plus exercise</p>

<p>After 10 weeks </p>

<p>Placebo with no excercise gained 0 pounds of muscle.</p>

<p>Steroids and no excercise gained 7 pounds of muscle.</p>

<p>Placebo with excercise gained 4 pounds of muscle.</p>

<p>Steroids with excercise gained 13 pounds of muscle.</p>

<div class="md"><p>It doesn&#39;t. 10 weeks is not a long enough time to measure changes in body composition and the study measures fat-free mass, not muscle mass. This means things like water weight aren&#39;t accounted for, and water weight tends to balloon your weight as much as 10lbs or so once you start cycling.</p>

<p>This study is always tossed around by people who don&#39;t actually know what it means.</p>

<div class="md"><p>This fricken study, man.</p>

<p>First off, it measures fat-free mass. This is different from muscle. Fat-free mass also consists of water weight, glycogen, etc. Water weight in particular tends to skyrocket up to 10lbs once you start cycling.</p>

<p>Secondly, 10 weeks is not a significant enough amount of time to measure muscle gain, <em>especially</em> when you&#39;re trying to observe it in natural subjects.

<p>TLDR: During 10 weeks a group of 10 men with decent 3x week weightlifting program supervised by professionals had lean mass gain of 1.9kg. During the same time frame 10 men who were given steroids in moderate doses gained 3.2kg lean mass with no exercise. Caloric and protein in take was standardized to be same for both groups and their weights and ages were similar also.</p>

<div class="md"><p>Exactly, testosterone really just gives the ability to recover faster, giving you longer workouts.

<div class="md"><p>Idk why you got downvoted, you are right. It increases recovery to allow you to work out longer and more frequently. It isn&#39;t as simple as take drug-&gt;become big.

<div class="md"><p>Yep. Prob just people who don&#39;t know any better. Myself for example worked out since my 20&#39;s. Used to partake in PEDs back then. Then stopped. And just worked out off and on until my early 40&#39;s. But once covid hit, and I stopped hitting the gym my body went totally hypogonastic. Felt like shit and looked like a puffy dad bod. libido shot to hell. Then saw a doc and sure enough my T levels were crashed. Now on a weekly TrT routine and back up to higher than normal levels but a very strict diet and workout regimen. Its gooddamn work, but the payoff is great.</p>

<div class="md"><p>Actually studies show that just giving people testosterone (forget the dosage) gave them the same or greater amount of muscle growth as those in a control group that did weight lifting for the same amount of time.  So, of course, if you work out on testosterone it builds even more but even taking it and doing nothing will build muscle mass like a normal person working out.</p>
