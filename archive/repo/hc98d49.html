<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Tbh, I&#39;m embrassed about my progress. I&#39;m a hard gainer and have trouble eating, all body image issues aside, I&#39;m very healthy and have been intermittent fasting since I was 16. </p>

<p>23M, 5&#39;11&quot;, 72kg -&gt; 71kg </p>

<p>My 1RMs:</p>

<ul>
<li>Bench: 90kg</li>
<li>Deadlift: 120kg </li>
<li>Squat: 90kg </li>
<li>Leg press: 200kg </li>
</ul>

<p>When I compare against everyone else, everyone in their first year seems to be able to gain lbs, if not a little. I&#39;m still fucking at 71kg. My strategy is volume, 6 days a week, smash out as much volume as possible to stimulate my muscles. And even though I&#39;m the fittest I&#39;ve been, I still feel small. </p>

<p>I can eat as much as I like and won&#39;t gain any weight. I am getting stronger though but its so fuxking slow. </p>

<p>I don&#39;t know, just need some perspective. Feeling disheartened tbh.</p>

<div class="md"><p>Your body composition CLEARLY improved , so why does weight even matter ? You lost fat while gaining muscle .. I’d say it was a successful beginner recomp, now I’d say you start a new bulk or maintain for a bit to help increase muscle mass then cut down afterwards</p>
