<div class="md"><p>So, I&#39;m 23 and I take test for medical reasons. Let me tell you why I&#39;m almost 100% positive he&#39;s on the sauce as well. Kumail is 43 and has made one of the sickest transformations I&#39;ve seen in all of Hollywood, he looks absolutely fucking incredible. But your natural testosterone levels begin declining heavily in your early 30&#39;s, which means that your ability to lose body fat and build muscle naturally becomes much harder as you age. Looking at his lifestyle beforehand as well, he didn&#39;t seem to look very healthy, which also plays a key role in your testosterone production.</p>

<p>That being said, there is absolutely ZERO shame in using test for medical or cosmetic reasons. If you need it or want it, then fucking go for it. Medically it was the best choice I ever made; I felt horrendous before my doctor figured out what was going on.</p>

<p>edit: I forgot to mention, being on test doesn&#39;t take away from the dedication and hard work you need to actually build the muscle to begin with. You can take gear all you want, and you will build muscle by sitting on your ass, but for it to actually show like his you need to be completely dedicated to your diet and training. That&#39;s just something people don&#39;t seem to grasp. Gear can&#39;t and won&#39;t do all the work for you.</p>
