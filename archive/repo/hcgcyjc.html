What is the purpose of this subreddit?
<br/><strong>Posted by <a id="userlink" href="https://www.reddit.com/user/hdhsjsskisudisisufue/">hdhsjsskisudisisufue</a>. </strong><em>Posted at 19:14 UTC on September 10, 2021. 57 Points. </em><em>(self.<a id="selfLink" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/StartingStrength/">StartingStrength</a>)</em><em> (<a id="postpermalink" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/StartingStrength/comments/plrmd2/what_is_the_purpose_of_this_subreddit/">Permalink</a>)</em>

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Lately this sub has had an extremely large influx of posts by people who are entirely unaware of what Starting Strength is, including users commenting on posts and offering (often, extremely poor/wrong) advice. It begs the question--what exactly is the purpose of this subreddit? Is it to be a general beginning strength subreddit that is filled with chronically weak people and wrong/bad advice, constant posts by people too lazy to read two pages from a book, and other garbage like all the other general fitness subreddits on this site?</p>

<p>It would be nice if we held the subreddit to a higher standard and actively encouraged thoughtful and informed discussion.</p>

<p>So, maybe as a first step in that direction--what do you think this subreddit should be? What is its purpose? How can we encourage higher post quality?</p>

<p>Yes? You’re in a subreddit for Starting Strength after all! This is the results it produces. The dogmatic blind leading the other dogmatic blind through a program created by someone who has never produced a competent strength athlete but thinks he knows what he’s doing.</p>

<div class="md"><p>I think we should also ban people who are so submissive that they publicly post pictures of their ass in the name of social acceptance. Since you&#39;re one of these people, what do you think, <a href="/u/just-another-scrub">/u/just-another-scrub</a>?</p>

<p>If you&#39;re going to argue, at least don&#39;t rely on logical fallacy. It isn&#39;t very convincing.</p>

<p>By the way, brigrading is against global reddit rules and something you and your (mostly weak) <a href="/r/fitnesscirclejerk">/r/fitnesscirclejerk</a> friends routinely engage in. Another reason to ban you. :)</p>

<div class="md"><p>Lol, you got me there! I’m seeking soooo much social acceptance by posting ass. The horror! At least I’m not bitching about the fact that the SS sub is full of weak know nothings. Like what else would you expect from one of the worst programs ever devised by man?</p>

<p>Name me a single high level athlete he’s produced that competes in either Powerlifting, Weightlifting or Strongman. I’ll wait.</p>

<p>I’m not brigading. I’m subbed here to get my daily dose of idiot.</p>
