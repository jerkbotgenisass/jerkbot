<p>Super knowledgeable? Not my point at all. My point is that those are pretty basic exercises that most gym-goers would be aware of. I just happened to put them together.</p>

<p>Anyways thanks for taking what I said another way.</p>

<p>Samesies!</p>

<div class="md"><p>OK - OP - I knew this was concerning me and I found a  <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XSDPBhfX87U">video</a> where they&#39;re doing this row on a ham developer machine(not sure where the name walrus row came from).  However - I think your form could be improved.</p>

<p>As you can see you have to try to bring your body to be as straight as possible(almost like you&#39;re doing a plank). </p>

<p>-I would adjust where your feet go on the machine so that you&#39;re parallel to the ground. </p>

<p>-Your heels are not touching the back of the pad and there&#39;s a gap. I would suppose it would strain the knees. </p>

<p>-And for the weight - I&#39;d use weight that wouldnt mess that straight form that you have. So if the weight is compromising that form, its a bit too much. </p>

<p>Let me know if this small change and the video helps! Last thing anyone would want is any injury that stops us from working out! </p>

<p>Best of luck!</p>

<div class="md"><p>That video shows multiple variations. What I&#39;m doing isn&#39;t wrong; it&#39;s just yet another variation. I promise, there was no undue stress on my back or my knees. It&#39;s absolutely fine.</p>

<div class="md"><p>Fair enough. The hive minds after me lol. Direct messages and all !?! Pretty toxic.</p>

<div class="md"><p>If there were a hive mind that I were part of or queen bee of or whatever then I would know who messaged you and what they said. I do not. There&#39;s no &quot;hive mind&quot;; you said something silly and a bunch of different people thought it was silly and a few of them told you that. And it&#39;s pretty silly for you to be throwing around the word &quot;toxic&quot; when you apparently can&#39;t handle someone doing an exercise that you don&#39;t understand. </p>

<p>You said it looked scary, couldn&#39;t explain exactly why, and then went and dug up some TNation/Seedman video, and based on that, told me what I &quot;have to&quot; change about my form on this exercise variation that you were previously completely unaware of. And at the same time had the nerve to act like you were giving me some help that I had asked for. &quot;Let me know if this helps!&quot; Given that what I was doing felt not only perfectly fine but pretty damn good, how would I assess whether or not that &quot;helps&quot;? There&#39;s nothing to fix. That&#39;s my GHR in my home gym and I had already taken the time to try different adjustments and different positions to figure out what felt best for me and what I was wanting to achieve with this exercise. Assuming that you somehow know better is absurd, and continuing to insist that you know better is indeed pretty toxic. You weren&#39;t &quot;just curious&quot;; you kept going even after I said it felt fine. Stop trying to act like you&#39;re some kind of victim here.</p>

<div class="md"><p>lol why are you being so defensive when I wasnt even trying to be offensive! lol I think you&#39;re unable to be reasonable here that I was trying to learn from you. You&#39;ve already made up your mind. So thats that. Enjoy the wrong form.</p>

<div class="md"><p>It doesn&#39;t matter whether or not you were &quot;trying to be offensive.&quot; The things you&#39;re saying are ridiculous and make absolutely no sense. You&#39;re saying you were just curious about how my back felt after this, but I had answered, and yet you kept going. You&#39;re <em>still</em> saying that my form is &quot;wrong&quot; on an exercise that you know nothing about and were previously completely unaware of. You&#39;re saying everyone else is toxic, but you&#39;re the one who can&#39;t accept that you&#39;re wrong and that you can&#39;t control other people. You&#39;re acting like you&#39;re a victim of some nonexistent hive mind. None of that makes any sense at all.</p>
