<div class="md"><p>Bodybuilders actually looked healthy and gorgeous back then, as opposed to the disgusting, veinous, sinewy,  bursting-at-the -seams bodies they strive for nowadays.</p>

<p>So odd how dramatically beauty standards change over time.</p>

<div class="md"><p>Men’s Physique and Classic Physique, are two classes in IFBB bodybuilding. Men’s physique is a more of the beach body look that certain individuals like, whereas Classic is a fairly new class made in response to the criticisms you have, as well as the criticism made by Arnold regarding “Bubble guts and mass monsters” </p>

<p>Hope this helps!</p>

<div class="md"><p>Love him to death. He got me into bodybuilding. He has a quote I share with everyone. It’s my favorite Arnold quote. </p>

<p><em>A well-built physique is a status symbol. It reflects you worked hard for it; no money can buy it. You cannot borrow it, you cannot inherit it, you cannot steal it. You cannot hold onto it without constant work. It shows discipline, it shows self-respect, it shows patience, work ethic, and passion. That is why I do what I do.</em></p>
