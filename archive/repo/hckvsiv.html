<div class="md"><p>I’ve watched several videos from certified trainers who say the gain ratio of what dips give you back is fucking terrible for your shoulders. I actively avoid dips cause they hurt the joints. Just trusting the Internet for once cause it seems to right to be wrong. I’m actually looking for someone to tell me otherwise here.</p>

<div class="md"><p>Dips are such a weirdo exercise. Part of the problem is that the form greatly dictates what you are working (lean forward and it&#39;s more like a push up. Stay upright and it&#39;s more like a tricep push.)</p>

<p>Also, it&#39;s a vertical push motion but the shoulders are depressed.</p>

<p>I would swap out dips for OHP or pike push ups. They have their own form requirements but they work vertical push motion, with shoulder elevation. Less problems than dips.</p>

<div class="md"><p>People love certain movements and dislike when people try to tell them not to do an exercise rather than how to do them &quot;better.&quot;</p>

<p>It&#39;s like someone asking, &quot;What&#39;s the best way to eat glass?&quot; And the correct answer is &quot;don&#39;t eat glass&quot;. &quot;But there has to be a safer way to eat glass...&quot;</p>

<p>Anyway, there are ways to do dips safely and there are better alternatives, but people mostly want the former not the latter.</p>

<div class="md"><p>Wait, doing dips are like eating glass? It&#39;s an inherently risky movement in your opinion?</p>
