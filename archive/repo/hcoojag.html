<div class="md"><p>Damn bro. <em>Before</em> 25? What kind of stuff were you into?</p>

<p>FWIW I had a &quot;bad back&quot; in my mid 20s. Lifting and getting a lot stronger helped a ton. My &quot;bad back&quot; was a temporary thing.</p>

<p>This doesn’t exactly fit my idea of a fit longevity excercise. I’m not downing this guy, I’m stating what’s a fact.  This sub has a split culture.  Those “getting fit after 30” and those who have been fit for awhile before 30. I’m used to the downvotes.</p>

<div class="md"><p>How is strengthening your body by picking things up off the ground not a good longevity exercise?</p>

<div class="md"><p>I deadlift regularly with weight that’s beneficial to targeting both weight / rep ratio without getting injured.  Doing straining, rounded back poor technique exercises for 2-3 poor reps is not helping anyone and there’s a culture of that predominates this sub as being “fit”.  It’s my opinion which you don’t agree with, but speaking from my experience, which I have more than enough of, I’m entitled to my own opinion no matter who doesn’t agree with it.</p>

<p>If the weight was lower and the technique was better, there wouldn’t be an issue.  Others seeing this think that by blowing themselves apart they aren’t “fit” enough.</p>

<p>I don’t care what you do. I excel at my respective skill set at this time which is submission wrestling.  If I’m calling in an airstrike or taking over an airfield, deadlifting 655 (which I have done at 189 bw) isn’t helping me.  Again, I’m allowed to say what I want as much as you are to downvote it.</p>

<div class="md"><p>The problem is that you&#39;re proving your experience and opinion to be garbage here by commenting on a topic that you appear to have no idea about. And yes you have a right to an opinion, just as we have the right to dismiss and even ridicule your opinion if it so warrants. We&#39;re not discussing submission wrestling here, this is stone lifting, and his technique is perfectly fine. So sure, speak all you want, it&#39;s just making you look stupider.</p>
