<div class="md"><p>Thanks but I don’t wanna. I’m used to gym styled set benches and not benching in power racks. Also it’s really easy to bail a failed bench. I failed multiple times benching and just roll the weight off of me or just tilt the barbell to the side and let the weights slide off.</p>

<div class="md"><p>Not sure why someone is downvoting - bailing a failed bench isn’t that hard… far more dangerous are the suicide grip people or possibly even the people who clip their bench press.</p>

<p>If you train in a gym you should clip your weights. Falling weights becomes a safety issue for people around you.</p>

<div class="md"><p>Yep just like them. It is more dangerous than just not having safeties for bench. Finding well known people doing dangerous things doesn’t make the things not dangerous. </p>

<p>If you have weights falling off unintentionally then you have bigger problems. You certainly shouldn’t suicide grip if you can’t even keep the bar straight. Weights don’t fall off just because they aren’t clipped unless you are doing something very wrong.</p>

<p>Edit: In case I didn’t make it clear, the no clips thing is specifically for bench without a spotter and mostly just when working near failure.</p>

<p>But the number of high-level and well-known people who use suicide grip to great effect certainly seems to me to be evidence that the grip is not dangerous.</p>

<p>Have you seen many instances on social media of people using suicide grip which has caused them to drop the bar? I haven&#39;t.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t know about you, but my thumb isn&#39;t strong enough to keep a bar from falling or not when I&#39;m using working weights. If my wrist position fails, the bar will fall.</p>

<p>Yes, this is what I was responding to. Dumping your weights on a failed lift is a safety issue.</p>
