Question about creatine

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I started reading about creatine on this sub today and saw someone mention that they should have started it when they were at 20%BF instead of 30% because of the creation of loose skin from the “puffiness” (which I read was also not a thing).</p>

<p>So my questions is, <strong>is there a best moment to incorporate it or is it good to go from the start of the ketogains journey?</strong></p>

<p>Context:
I’m 36F and still at 40-45%BF so working on fat loss. I’m also in a weight loss/body recomp challenge at the gym that included an InBody scan at the beginning and another one at the end so looking for a little boost in performance. I calculated my macros based on the BF provided by the scan, starting at 45%. I’ve dropped some weight in the past month but haven’t measured my progress yet, but I just feel my clothes fitting significantly better. </p>

<p>I’m only part of the challenge for motivation, no set goal for these 6 weeks: just consistent progress with BF measurements included for macro management.</p>

<p>TIA</p>
