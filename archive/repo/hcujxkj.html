<div class="md"><p>Love to see it! Those heavier bells really do help your technique. Since I&#39;ve moved up to 16s I&#39;m understanding better the concept of &quot;relaxing&quot; in rack and using my legs more. Looking great!</p>

<div class="md"><p>Heavy bells aren&#39;t good to work on form, by the by. You&#39;ll hurt yourself. I&#39;m all for encouraging progress, but this is borderline dangerous.</p>

<div class="md"><p>Once again, <a href="/r/kettlebell">r/kettlebell</a> safety police to the rescue! What the fuck is up with this sub? Nobody&#39;s like this on any of the other weightlifting subs.</p>

<p>She knows what she&#39;s doing, and so do I. I&#39;m specifically talking here about how moving up in weight WHEN YOU ALREADY HAVE FORM DOWN further improves your technique by making you rely more on using your legs and momentum, and also how heavier weights help you understand why lifters do certain movements. Also specifically talking about kettlebell sport here.</p>

<p>Don&#39;t worry officer, nobody&#39;s in danger here</p>

<div class="md"><p>Change your diaper and back off the rhoids, sugartits. </p>

<p>Her form sucks here. There&#39;s no control. And while moving up in weight does help you build muscle, you&#39;re not going to be lifting anything if your discs slip cuz you wanted to make a video with a big boy weight.</p>

<p>But you&#39;re right. Who cares. Break your back. Just hope you&#39;re not in the &#39;states, or you&#39;ll also get a hospital bill you can&#39;t pay. Lift that up like a champ.</p>

<div class="md"><p>I&#39;m not in the purple circle. I&#39;m in the pink. I&#39;m a chiropractor, and I see patients do stupid shit like this all the time. Good for my business, but I&#39;d rather have less work than treat people who think a personal trainer with a three month online diploma knows what they&#39;re doing.</p>

<p>I&#39;m fine not being nice. I prefer being right.</p>

<div class="md"><p>If youâ€™re taking about me, thank you for the concern but I have a coach! He gave the go ahead for me to move up to the 20. </p>

<p>My form looks different because we do <a href="https://www.google.com/amp/s/breakingmuscle.co.uk/uk/amp/fitness/kettlebell-sport-what-it-is-and-how-to-get-started-2">kettlebell sport</a> so we train to compete for max reps in a 10 minute set without putting the bells down at all! Itâ€™s incredibly hard. </p>

<p>It wouldnâ€™t be physically possible to lift that long without special and efficient technique (for example how I rest my elbow on my hip so the weight of the bell is transferred to my legs and not my back) so it looks weird but thereâ€™s a reason for it! </p>

<p>Itâ€™s actually a very safe and fun way to lift ðŸ˜Š</p>
