<div class="md"><p>This is the one who felt safer having her trainer spot her for squats because she didn&#39;t know how the rack worked. Even after I tried explaining it to her she didn&#39;t get it, and she got really snippy about it. She apparently didn&#39;t realize that the safeties were adjustable and said there was no room to squat over them. And simply refused to admit that she didn&#39;t know how it worked. Oh, and then said I was batshit crazy and belonged in a mental hospital. Just a little bit of projection there, I assume.</p>

<div class="md"><p>Can you lie even more? I said i don&#39;t have enough space where the racks were and i don&#39;t like squatting like that. I also explained to you that my trainer can catch that without an effort and you had to be smarter. Because you know everything, don&#39;t you? A fucking powerlifter that won world championship cannot catch 70 kgs! Way to be a bitter cunt! I knew women tend to be bitches to each other, but you surely take the cake üéÇ üòò Now stalk me some.more</p>

<p>I know exactly what you wrote. It&#39;s all still there. <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/fitness30plus/comments/pcj6h9/f44_squat_pr_70kgs_at_68_bw/hamge86?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3">&quot;You didn&#39;t see that you don&#39;t have room to squat over it.&quot;</a> And you never did explain what you meant about the &quot;bar racks&quot; being 1m apart. If you mean the inside width of the rack itself, that&#39;s perfectly normal and many, many people squat in racks that size. Again, if you don&#39;t want to then that&#39;s fine, but you seem to think that the rack is totally unusable and you still don&#39;t seem to understand how it&#39;s supposed to work. </p>

<p>Really? Can you have a disagreement without resorting to personal insults? It would seem not. </p>

<p>Amazing that you don&#39;t see the irony here.</p>

<div class="md"><p>Can you have a disagreement without shitposting? If not, that makes you a bitter cunt. You understood well what i meant the first time, forgive me for not knowing all terminology. I said that space is too narrow for me, i do not like to squat there. You chose to keep bashing me and laugh at me when i said i trust my trainer more</p>
