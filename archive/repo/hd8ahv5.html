<div class="md"><p>Your glutes should never ever leave the bench (had the same issue before). Spread your feet apart more, and place them forward if need be.</p>

<p>The aim is to have the knees lower than the hips on the horizontal plane. This way, the leg drive is properly transmitted into the upper back (no energy leak) which assists the concentric portion of the movement in a safer and more efficient way.</p>

<p>You are at high risk of injuring your lower back here.  You need much more shoulder stability and hip stability not to mention more core activation.</p>

<p>As a movement professional myself, I would advise you to work with a trainer who is equip with the appropriate knowledge and understanding of biomechanics to guide you to achieve your goal.</p>

<p>Really can’t stress how dangerous the lower back leaving the bench while lifting a load of that weight really is.  In studio, I have worked with many lifters who have lumber dysfunction due to this very thing.</p>

<p>Spend the money.  Learn the correct way.  Get the proper knowledge on how to recruit your muscles. Avoid pain in the future.  You are going to have this body for a while.  Take care of it.</p>

<p>No he&#39;s not. Srs.</p>

<p>What is a movement professional? Are you just a pilates instructor?</p>

<p>How much do you bench?</p>

<p>I doubt that. Few people with healthy backs ever have back issues caused by bench pressing. If anything it&#39;s an issue caused by something else that is being aggravated by arching.</p>

<div class="md"><p>I know, and as I’ve said, I’ve done it before as well, so I’m not judging him or anything, quite the contrary. The issue is that it’s detrimental to long-term lumbar health . Keeping proper form -at least acceptable- even during 1RM attempts is crucial. Better to fail than to make it with a horrendous and compromised form. Ego maims you if you don’t check it.</p>

<div class="md"><p>How is it detrimental to lumbar health? There’s almost no load on it. </p>

<p>The load of the bench press is on the shoulders, lifting your ass just allows you to include your lats in the lift.</p>

<div class="md"><p>I agree with you that there&#39;s not much direct load on it.  The issue is imv in the hyperextension itself (the powerlifters&#39; form being a striking example).</p>

<p>For a lot of people, hyperextension isn&#39;t recommended, just like hyperflexion. </p>

<p>Anecdotal experience is not science, but at the individual level, benching with an excessive arch —or even worse, lifting the butt off of the bench— hurt me. And I now from online threads that I&#39;m not the only one. </p>

<p>Sure, some people might get away with it in the long run, but not everyone is that lucky, myself included. </p>

<p>If you can do it consistently without any pain, more power to you (literally).</p>

<div class="md"><p>Disingenuous argument: whether he&#39;s injuring himself on this exact lift isn&#39;t the point of my initial comment, and I think you know it. </p>

<p>I&#39;ll try to be clear one last time, just in case. At the failure point, we both can see he starts to shake: if he loses too much tension in the buttocks, the lower back can be in a compromised position (I should know). Here, he didn&#39;t hurt himself (good for him).<br/>
OP uploaded a video asking for advice, I gave mine as someone who injured himself doing exactly that. You don&#39;t have to believe me though.  You think that his form is good, I don&#39;t. I hope for his sake that I&#39;m the one in the wrong, especially on the long run.</p>
