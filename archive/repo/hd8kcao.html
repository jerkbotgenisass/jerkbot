<div class="md"><p>The range of motion of this exercise sucks. It&#39;s a flavor of the month style exercise that gym thots and Instagram models push on to females who want a shortcut.  Learn how to use your glutes when you squat rather than doing upright high bar squats like some sort of weight lifter. Don&#39;t take the easy way out. You&#39;re never going to overload your glutes like you can with a squat.  Plus,  If you desire any sort of athleticism to go with your hypertrophy, You need to learn how to use your posterior chain together rather than trying to isolate the most important piece. This says strength training,  not beauty contest training as a subreddit.</p>

<p>This exercise, like the leg press, is for cowards.</p>
