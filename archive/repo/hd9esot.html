<div class="md"><p>How is it detrimental to lumbar health? There’s almost no load on it. </p>

<p>The load of the bench press is on the shoulders, lifting your ass just allows you to include your lats in the lift.</p>

<div class="md"><p>I agree with you that there&#39;s not much direct load on it.  The issue is imv in the hyperextension itself (the powerlifters&#39; form being a striking example).</p>

<p>For a lot of people, hyperextension isn&#39;t recommended, just like hyperflexion. </p>

<p>Anecdotal experience is not science, but at the individual level, benching with an excessive arch —or even worse, lifting the butt off of the bench— hurt me. And I now from online threads that I&#39;m not the only one. </p>

<p>Sure, some people might get away with it in the long run, but not everyone is that lucky, myself included. </p>

<p>If you can do it consistently without any pain, more power to you (literally).</p>

<div class="md"><p>Disingenuous argument: whether he&#39;s injuring himself on this exact lift isn&#39;t the point of my initial comment, and I think you know it. </p>

<p>I&#39;ll try to be clear one last time, just in case. At the failure point, we both can see he starts to shake: if he loses too much tension in the buttocks, the lower back can be in a compromised position (I should know). Here, he didn&#39;t hurt himself (good for him).<br/>
OP uploaded a video asking for advice, I gave mine as someone who injured himself doing exactly that. You don&#39;t have to believe me though.  You think that his form is good, I don&#39;t. I hope for his sake that I&#39;m the one in the wrong, especially on the long run.</p>

<p>What? </p>

<p>You said; </p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>And I asked “what hyperextension?”</p>

<p>How is it disingenuous to ask you about the point you made?</p>
