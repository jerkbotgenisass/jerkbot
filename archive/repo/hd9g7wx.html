<div class="md"><p>My problem with exercise science it that itâ€™s pretty meh and has a ton of issues. So I get my science from people who are scientists <em>and</em> actually train people and/or have achieved something of note. </p>

<p>Something neither SSS or Cavalier have.</p>

<div class="md"><p>So what exactly are the issues when it comes to sport science? I need you to be precise cause it seems like you think your feelings are valid and their not. You canâ€™t deny Jeff has millions of subscribers so itâ€™s like heâ€™s training millions of people.</p>

<p>Small sample sizes, replicability issues, study parameters that canâ€™t really be applied to the ways people actually train, etc. </p>

<p>Prominent exercise science people like the guys over at Stronger by Science talk about these issues constantly. Does that mean the information is useless? Nope. Does that mean that it has limited practical applicability? You bet. </p>

<p>Which is why only being able to point to your science degree for authority is dumb. You need actual experience or youâ€™re just puking shit out of your mouth while pretending like you know what youâ€™re doing. </p>

<p>Fucking lol! No. The one guy heâ€™s trained for the past however long looks like heâ€™s barely stepped in the gym. Youâ€™re hilarious dude.</p>
