<div class="md"><p>This Sub is by far the best strength/fitness sub. So many people getting after it and working hard, people like mythical and dadlifts doing crazy conditioning and still putting up beastly numbers in lifting. Meanwhile I seen a post last night in another sub where someone was worried about adding two days cardio to a 3 day lifting routine… people were telling him to be careful “the body needs rest” haha</p>

<p>This may very well be the best sub on reddit overall. I deleted my account about 8 months ago but came back just for <a href="/r/weightroom">/r/weightroom</a></p>

<div class="md"><p>Whoah, posting a link to that sub? It&#39;s a not-so-stealthy child porn ring/shock sub. So... you need to be a pedophile with a camera or somebody who&#39;s into that. Please report postings of that link to mods/admins in the future; I&#39;ve already done so in this case. It&#39;s a CSS thing, and a pretty well-known one at that. Kinda like how a few circlejerks change usernames to reflect a theme, except mirroring other subs cosmetically while the links direct to kiddie porn assuming you&#39;re using some tool (it&#39;s like TOR, I think, but I don&#39;t really pay attention to the shady side of the net - if you&#39;re tech savvy I&#39;d guess you&#39;ve heard of it). So this sub moves around whenever it gets deleted, and it&#39;s up to people reporting it and the users maliciously linking to it to get the admins&#39; attention. I assume they report it to authorities, but these subs keep popping up. I miss the days when at least you knew <a href="/r/creepshots">/r/creepshots</a> would be the disgusting borderline sub instead of having to be wary of every sub you get linked to. Also, most of the links there will attempt to install some nasty viruses on your computer if you don&#39;t have the requisite tool. Unless you&#39;re using VirtualBox or have a trustworthy firewall I&#39;d recommend a virus scan.</p>

<div class="md"><p>It&#39;s so difficult to gage these things though man. I understand that overtraining is basically impossible but I do think there is room for recommending less exercise to novices. People who are new to the gym have a habit of getting &quot;health kicks&quot;, doing crazy workouts five or six times a week and then they crash and burn after less than a month. </p>

<p>You see this like clock work every January. My gym gets flooded with people who are clearly out of shape but determined to give their all. Come February those people are no where to be found. I think some people would be better off just consistently doing &quot;chill&quot; workouts a couple times a week, if it keeps them more motivated in the long term. Time is always going to win out over intensity. </p>

<p>It sounds a lot like your problem is that you don&#39;t want a space full of novice lifters (novice here meaning has never lifted before, doesn&#39;t know basic terms etc). Which is fine but those spaces can exist for a reason e.g. <a href="/r/fitness">r/fitness</a> is a great space for people who don&#39;t even know what a barbell <em>is</em> to start learning about lifting.</p>

<div class="md"><p>Hey no i have zero problems with novices, i was one myself and there are alot on this sub who put more experienced people too shame. My problem i guess is more with people who think along the lines of “I squatted on Monday, no way i could cycle my bike on tuesday my legs wont be optimally recovered and ill lose all my gainzzzz”</p>

<div class="md"><p>Yeah and I guess that boils down to people not really understanding what &quot;recovery&quot; means. I&#39;m still in the process of feeling it out myself but, right now, I focus way more on diet and sleep. I don&#39;t feel like &quot;rest&quot; is as important to recovery as some people think.</p>

<div class="md"><p>Absolutely agree, so many weak mindsets in todays world, any chance to find an excuse they will be there. Everyone has the same problems, whether you choose to bitch and moan about them is a choice. If you only trained when you had optimal conditions in your life there wouldnt be much training done haha</p>

<div class="md"><p>I know what you&#39;re saying, the culture in some places just kills the possibility to a decent life by setting stupid standards. I&#39;m only 20 and i have ex classmates that have 2 kids, some got fucking married, it&#39;s mind boggling to me. They have no degrees, no skills, they spent their youth partying and got knocked up in one drunken night. </p>

<p>Then they work minimum wage, dead-end jobs and drag their kids to the same lifestyle by not making them get a decent education and making them have to focus on making money early because they grew poor and want to get nice shit for themselves. You might be saying that you don&#39;t need an education for a good job and you&#39;d be right, but statistically speaking more than half the fucking country works minimum wage.</p>

<div class="md"><p>What y&#39;all are talking about really reminds me of this Marcus Garvey quote from the 1930s &quot;We are going to emancipate ourselves from mental slavery because whilst others might free the body, none but ourselves can free the mind&quot;.

<div class="md"><p>So I ended up in both. I lived on my own after the 10th grade. I had the benefit of growing up with my dad that told me education was the answer. He wasn&#39;t able to do it, but just instilled its importance to me. &quot;So you don&#39;t have to do this.&quot; Fella managed to start a decent fleet of transports though. I started my first businesses before I left high school. Polishing and detailing trucks. Tree removal. Then hilariously my first engineering job was in automation for trucks. Hated every bit of it as a career and the corporate world, but school helps teach the principles of big picture and delayed gratification. If you looked at me you&#39;d think I was poor at a glance. I drive old beaters etc, but have multiple properties. </p>

<p>Thinking bigger picture just seems to be a rare trait around here. What you&#39;re talking about. People trap themselves and don&#39;t look beyond the end of the week let alone goals for multiple years. </p>

<p>Honestly as cheesy as it sounds I always found training a great parallel for success anywhere. Incremental increases just really fucking add up. </p>

<p>The last few years I&#39;ve finally learned to reach out and sub contract etc and just organize projects instead of doing everything myself, and damn what an improvement. Money I make just from using my phone is the fucking best.</p>
