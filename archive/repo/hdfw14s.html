Why do I not looked jacked in clothes?

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>So I&#39;ve seen myself in a few photos recently, and honestly looking at these photo&#39;s, unless you know me from way before I started hitting gym, you wouldn&#39;t know I&#39;m &quot;jacked&quot;. </p>

<p>Is it to do with your natural skeletal frame? I was watching Rocky I the other night, and Sly packs less muscle than Creed/Carl Weathers. However, when clothed, Sly looks huge and is a presence. Whereas, Creed obviously packs way more muscle, which is obvious when they&#39;re both in the ring top less, but clothed he looks small in comparison to Sly.</p>

<p>When I&#39;m in my vest in the gym, I get admired on my back, traps, delts, biceps. But wearing a full-sleeve, or a button up, or a sweater, you wouldn&#39;t think. </p>

<p>Anyone have this issue?</p>
