<div class="md"><p>Have there been any/many studies done on the Sumo vs conventional pull in elite lifters? This is purely anecdotal, but I feel like many of the lifters who achieve really high bodyweight to lifted weight ratios do so using the sumo. This is contrasted to worlds strongest men lifters, who achieve the highest overall weights but generally have very high bodyweights and generally seem to choose conventional DL.</p>

<div class="md"><p>And is the reasoning because Sumo is stronger? Because I&#39;ve never seen anything showing this to be true.</p>

<div class="md"><p>I’m not an expert on Strongman but I think the reasoning is because they very very rarely ever actually pull a deadlift bar with actual weights. Strongman events usually involve elevated items, like wagon wheels or truck tires. </p>

<p>Also, the sumo stance isn’t stronger for everyone. Andy Bolton and Benedict Magnusson both pulled over a grand with a conventional stance. </p>

<p>Top level lifters are going to find what works for them within the boundaries of the rules of that competition. Both Thor and Hall wore deadlifts suits and used straps but used conventional stances because that’s what the rules allow. Belkin, in the video above, could use a sumo stance but couldn’t use straps or a deadlift suit, as per the rules</p>

<div class="md"><p>Sumo shortens the distance of travel as well as allows you to “preload” your gluts, it’s going to be easier for most lifters as it change the mechanics of the lift removing a lot of the early load from your lower back too. With very heavy weight it can be a bit more difficult to maintain balance with a sumo stance tho.</p>

<p>So with sumo being less work (weight travels a shorter distances both due to the narrower grip and the wider stance) and as it changes the the pull mechanics of the lift by drifting away from the mechanics of the more Olympic lifts like the snatch and clean it’s considered a cheat stance and isn’t allowed in certain competition or events just like gear isn’t allowed in others.</p>

<p>But since the deadlift isn’t an Olympic sport there isn’t a gold standard for the lift so technically there isn’t a wrong way of doing it. For general strength training / hypertrophy the Romanian deadlift should be prioritized anyhow since it allows for many more ways of progressive overload, it’s more work since it’s a controlled lift in both directions (higher time under tension), and it allows you to strengthen weaker muscles over time that would normally cause you to fail or break form in a regular deadlift.</p>
