<div class="md"><p>Conventional is viewed by most as the superior movement.    </p>

<p>I do sumo because I have a bunch of hardware in my ankle that prevents me from getting my shins at the proper angle.   With sumo, I can have vertical shins and still deadlift.   Most people who do Sumo do so because you can move more weight.</p>
