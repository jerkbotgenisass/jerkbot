<div class="md"><p>Not the guy you replied to, but I&#39;ll just throw in what works for me: the more you fill up on protein and veggies, the less room you&#39;ll have for carbs, snacks, and treats.</p>

<p>Pick a few proteins and your favorite veggie sides so you have 2-5 dishes you can make and enjoy repeatedly. Add carbs, but the amount can vary depending on goals (keep it low if you are losing weight, but more if you are lifting weights)</p>

<p>I can&#39;t get more specific than that, as I&#39;m no expert and it varies from person to person. The most important thing is to eat healthy, whole foods that you enjoy, as 99% of diets fail, mostly due to people making themselves miserable.</p>

<div class="md"><p>Sure, that&#39;s no problem. Just know that I&#39;m not any kind of expert, trainer, or doctor. Just a dude that found a bit of success.</p>

<p>I&#39;d suggest taking a walk everyday. It&#39;s a very underrated exercise for weight loss, and much easier on your knees and joints than jogging or running.</p>

<p>Personally I&#39;m not a believer in completely cutting out your favorite foods (meals or deserts), IMO it just leads to burnout and going back to old habits. Instead, focus on either reducing portion sizes, reducing the frequency of how often you have them, or both.</p>

<p>Don&#39;t rush things, start by making one change in your lifestyle. Maybe begin walking for 15-30 minutes, or having more home cooked meals per week. Tackling one obstacle at a time is much easier and means you&#39;re more likely to succeed. Once you&#39;re comfortable with that change, try making another. Either increase your walking time/distance, or schedule certain days of the week to be home cooked meal days.</p>

<p>Ultimately, weight loss is not the result of a single successful diet.. you will have to make changes that you are comfortable with following for the rest of your life. This is why diets tend to fail.. people think they can beast the next 30 days and go back to their old habits, which only results in the weight coming back. And because you need to make lifestyle changes, might as well make them enjoyable! You don&#39;t need to eat kale or starve yourself to lose weight :)</p>

<div class="md"><p>I find that I can eat as much meat, cheese, oil and veg as I want as long as I cut out high G.I. carbs and sugar and still lose weight. So I have unsweetened muesli for breakfast, then lots of  salads (with homemade vinegarette and sometimes feta cheese) grilled or roasts meats and fish, omelettes, grilled veggies (mushrooms, asparagus, peppers, courgette, red onion, long stem broccoli are all good grilled with oil, salt and lemon juice) and fruit when I want something sweet. Stir fries are good too, or even a curry or chilli with no rice.</p>

<div class="md"><p>So, glycemic index is a way of measuring how quickly the carbohydrates in food are turned to sugar by your body. </p>

<p>High GI foods - refined sugar, white bread, white rice, potatoes - cause your body to produce a lot of insulin making it more inclined to store all the extra energy as fat. </p>

<p>So getting more of your nutrition from low-GI carbs will make your body less inclined to store spare energy as fat, keep your blood sugar at a more even level (no more crashes) and hopefully help with weight loss if combined with sensible levels of calories and exercise. </p>

<div class="md"><p>Basically don&#39;t eat sugar.
It&#39;s not healthy, doesn&#39;t make you feel full, promotes snacking, and makes you want more.
Also, stay away from alcohol and greasy fast foods.</p>

<p>If you eat healthy whole foods - whole grain, vegetables and some non-greasy meats like chicken and white fish, you can have delicious food and be healthy.</p>

<p>Feel like a snack? Make food, you are hungry.
Prep food, have meal times if it helps. Don&#39;t eat sugary or greasy snacks between meals. Not only is it better for your body, but you will feel more in control.</p>

<p>And along with the better eating habits, make sure you get 30min of exercise everyday, be it walking or something more intense, and lift weights a couple of times a week. Find a pace that you like, and stick to it.</p>

<p>I mean it. stick to it.
If you tell yourself &quot;tomorrow I&#39;ll go for an early run before work&quot;, then make sure you f*ing get it done when the alarm rings, or you will feel that you lost control, and things will go downhill.</p>

<div class="md"><p>The hard truth is, almost everybody knows what losing weight by entails, and which foods are better and worse. There aren’t really secrets. You just have to find something that is sustainable for you and stick to it. </p>

<p>Eat more vegetables, eat more lean-ish meats (not burgers or bacon), eat less junk food and eat less in general, and get some exercise every day - even a walk.</p>

<div class="md"><p>The only things I drink are water, black coffee, tea (with a little honey), seltzer, and sometimes fresh juice. No alcohol at all.</p>

<p>Overall, I&#39;m eating with common sense right now. Treat a treat/snack as such; once in a blue moon.</p>

<p>I&#39;m not vegan, but my dairy intake is extremely limited. No milk, unless I&#39;m baking, which is seldom. Butter for eggs and toast. Occasionally I&#39;ll snack on some cheese, but that seems to be about once every couple of months. Organic fruit, veggies, eggs, meat, grains, and bread as much as you can.</p>

<p>I run in the morning, so I start with water and coffee and an apple. Afterwards, I&#39;ll have some toast with eggs, or avocado, or butter and jam, with a little more fruit. My protein of choice is usually chicken, but I&#39;ll eat beef, lamb, or seafood too.</p>

<p>I&#39;ll make salads with dark leafy greens, so spinach, kale, collards, and even arugula. Apples, fennel, mint, and chopped nuts are nice in there. Berries, too.</p>

<p>Roast chicken, whole or pieces, are really nice. Potatoes and steamed or roasted veggies to accommodate.</p>

<p>That&#39;s basically it. DM me if you want specifics :)</p>

<div class="md"><p>Tracking food helps a lot too. I have found out I do best on a 40% protein 30% fats 30% carbs macro. </p>

<p>I use an app called Lose It to track stuff it takes about 3 minutes per meal maybe to input all the information. </p>

<p>Lost 20 lbs from memorial weekend to august 18th, which was my goal before going to Disney World with my family. Didn’t track anything while at Disney but I did walk 12 miles a day for a week so it balanced out in the end. </p>

<p>Goal is to be under 20% BMI by the end of spring but even if I don’t quite make it I will be happy since I was at 36% BMI when I started.</p>

<div class="md"><p>Use a tracking app to count calories. If you eat under your maintenance calories (the calories your body uses throughout a day) you will burn fat to make up the difference. As other people said eat filling food that are lower in calories like veggies. Watch out for sauces and stuff like that you might be tempted to not count on the calorie tracker. They add up.</p>
