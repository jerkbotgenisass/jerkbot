<div class="md"><p>1RM attempts aren’t great for form checks.  </p>

<p>Benching more will help with both.</p>

<div class="md"><p>Okay thank you, I will try to get another one up with a full set at some point. </p>

<p>I do flat bench 1 time per week and then various other chest exercises that Athlean X recommended on a PPL program from his YouTube channel.</p>

<div class="md"><p>I’d steer away from athleanX…<br/>
There are tons of valid criticisms against him, but that’s not the point of your post and you can do whatever you want :)   </p>

<p>A PPL should typically be run 6 days a week, and will have you benching at least 2x a week.<br/>
I’d recommend adding bench sets in on other days if you’re really trying to progress or struggling with your bench and want to stick you leave current program.</p>

<div class="md"><p>Thanks for the advice. Most of the stuff he says seems to be a lot of weird exercises, so I know what you mean. </p>

<p>I included images of the routine, let me know if it makes sense as you have way more experience than I do.</p>

<div class="md"><p>Benching once a week should be enough, since you won&#39;t be benching heavy weights on your second push day either way. Also Jeff from athlean x has good physique and good lifts. I don&#39;t why you wouldn&#39;t take his advice</p>
