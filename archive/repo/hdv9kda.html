<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>40M trying to incorporate squats into my routine. I started with body weight squats and the soreness lasted for days.  I switched to the leg extension and curl machines. Lately, I have incorporated dumbbell squats to help avoid runner related injuries and my legs are sore for days. I sprained my back at work and my legs have been competing with my back on the pain scale. Does this get better?</p>

<div class="md"><p>Squats are fun and great, a lot times just not worth the risk. With age exercise selection is a must for longevity, if you want to lift for health I would say cycle them off every 6 weeks. Use jump squats, alternating jump lunge, one leg lunge , leg extensions and leg curls and you will get the alot of leg benefits and not be feeling beat up. Once you have some stronger legs go back to squats, is the risk worth the reward?</p>
