<div class="md"><p>Been lifting for about 3 weeks now. How long is too long to get my form right? </p>

<p>I wouldn’t say it’s terrible, and I try my best to correct it when I notice. But at what point is going up in weight a bad idea because my form isn’t good enough?</p>

<div class="md"><p>I have spent about 3-6 months working on my technique before upping weight.</p>

<p>Focus on the basics first - master the squat,hinge,push,pull,core (all movement patterns)</p>

<p>This also depends on what form you are looking to improve? </p>

<p>Understanding movement patterns and how they fit in your current workout routine is likely you&#39;re best bet in learning proper form.</p>

<div class="md"><p>3-6 months before increasing weight at all?? </p>

<p>That’s a horrendous waste of time. Just run a beginner LP and learn as you go.</p>

<div class="md"><p>Form is continually mastered throughout your lifting career. Just make sure you aren&#39;t ego-lifting, i.e. don&#39;t willingly sacrifice form to move up in weight. Try some higher weight next time and think about how your form is either maintained or broken down.</p>
