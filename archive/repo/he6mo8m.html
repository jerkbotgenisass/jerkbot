<div class="md"><p>You should stop deadlifting. It’s impressive that you’re that strong at that age but it also makes you look foolish as well. Just stop dude. Do exercises that don’t put that kind of stress on you body.</p>

<div class="md"><p>I agree with a lot of this but is harsh. The thing they escapes people is that if you get injured doing this at 50 a full recovery is not likely lol.</p>

<div class="md"><p>This is not only not true, but is unnecessary fear mongering.  You know who doesn’t have back problems when they are older?  People with strong backs.</p>

<div class="md"><p>This place is full of broad statements. Myself included. But people are individuals, and unique. I’m just stating the less liked side of exercise. Risk. It’s important to weigh this stuff when programming.</p>

<div class="md"><p>Everything has risk.  Not exercising also has risk.  If you spend all your time evaluating risk for basic activities, you will never do anything.  Exercise, but particularly resistance training, has some of the lowest injury rates among activities that involve being active.  So, you’re still fear-mongering but doing it about something that is unnecessary to do it for.</p>
