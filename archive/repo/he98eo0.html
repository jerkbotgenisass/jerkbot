I refuse to give up, but I feel hopeless

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I have made 0 progress since I started 5 months ago. Virtually nothing. I still weigh the same, I still have the same fat percentage, I still have the same BMI. </p>

<p>I really need some motivating words to tell me to snap the fuck out of it and just go for it. And I need some advice too. </p>

<p>I feel like my form is all wrong, and I’m still learning forms. I’ve stayed away from deadlifting and the squat machine because it’s crowded by powerlifters, and I’m sick of it. I can’t lift much at all, for instance on an incline bench press I can only lift a maximum of 10kg either side, for reference I’m 5’11 and 18 years old. Where do you start, properly? How do I get out of this cycle where I keep losing motivation, and don’t try hard enough in the gym? Is it normal to start off this weak? The only exercise I do at the moment is the gym, and I want to do it correctly. Please help</p>

<div class="md"><p>What kind of results have you seen using this method? You do realize you can workout and not be fully 100% right? A beginner doesn&#39;t need to worry about an uppoer/lower split. They&#39;re better served keeping things simple that&#39;s why most beginner programs are full body. Look at something like 5/3/1 for beginners. Full body and it even lets you chose assistance to focus on whatever muscles you want.</p>

<div class="md"><p>I’ve seen my personal best results with PPL, but I know that everyone is different. When I started and used the full body workout every three days I saw the least results, due to the two rest days in between and doing nothing or thinking I have to do cardio. Also the 2 hour workout is completely moronic. Upper lower split I made some progress but the PPL split has been my personal most efficient workout routine. Full body workout for me was honestly the dumbest thing I did working out and I wish I never did it. </p>

<p>Once I switched all the way to PPL (and I’ve been that way for almost a year and a half) I’ve put on 42 pounds and still have a body fat percentage of 13% right now and I’m two months into a bulk. Again if it works for you great, but it’s definitely not the most efficient way of doing things.</p>

<div class="md"><p>Why were you taking 2 days off in between workouts? You don&#39;t have to just sit on your butt and do nothing on rest days. You can do cardio and active recovery too.</p>

<div class="md"><p>Lol I can already tell you’re offended and don’t know what you’re talking about. You should train hard enough that your muscles are sore, and you give yourself two days in between for the muscles to recover, anything earlier than that will slow down results. And like I said, I would do cardio, which was a huge waste of time for me since I was trying to gain weight. Also a terrible idea for 99% of people if you’re doing cardio 4 days a week, huge rookie mistake.</p>

<p>Put your ego down and learn how to take advice without getting offended. Also maybe know what you’re talking about before you try and criticize people who put a lot more time and effort into working out than you clearly do if you’re doing full body workouts lol</p>

<div class="md"><p>I&#39;m not getting offended. Sounds like you&#39;re projecting.</p>

<p>You&#39;re the one who doesn&#39;t know what you&#39;re talking about. Soreness isn&#39;t an indication of a good workout, and you don&#39;t need two days off in between each full body session. Plus even if you have a bit of DOMS you can still train. You don&#39;t need to be at 100% all the time. If I waited until I had full energy and zero soreness to workout, I&#39;d probably never workout. I&#39;ve been doing a beginner 5/3/1 template which is full body for the past 5 months. I went 3 days a week, and I saw fantastic progress. The only time I had 2 days off between workouts was on the weekend but I was still active.</p>

<p>What are your lifts at? </p>

<p>You should also be doing cardio even if you&#39;re trying to gain weight. It&#39;s good for you and it helps increase work capacity so you can do more and get stronger. All you need is a 30min session 3x a week and you&#39;re good. It&#39;ll make you a more well rounded athlete.</p>

<div class="md"><p>“You don’t need two days off in between each full body session”</p>

<p>That’s all I needed to read to realize you’re an idiot lol, keep typing whatever you want after that but nobody’s listening to you. Have fun taking 3-4 years to put on the muscle you could gain in 9 months if you would put your ego down and actually listen to information instead of pretend to know it all and workout like a caveman. Have fun with the back problems champ lol</p>

<p>Also like how he just assumes everyone is training to be an “athlete”, just tops off his superior knowledge</p>

<div class="md"><p>Again, how much do you lift?</p>

<p>Here I&#39;ll start: </p>

<p>Squat: 260lbs </p>

<p>Bench: 203lbs</p>

<p>DL: 325lbs</p>

<p>At a bodyweight of 161lbs. That&#39;s only 5 months on 5/3/1, doing a full body template 3x a week.   </p>

<p>our lack of experience really shows by thinking soreness = progress and you need to be 100% before you go to work out again. I haven&#39;t had any back issues and I&#39;m stronger than I&#39;ve ever been, and I keep improving.</p>
