<div class="md"><p>For reps or for my max? Because I’m about 20-30 pounds less weight than you and my bench PR is 235 and my form is actually good. You’re arching your back like you’re cardi B at a frat party for an incredibly low amount of weight man. Again, put your pride down and start taking peoples advice. Nobody likes a no it all douche, especially one with a form like this.</p>

<div class="md"><p>You clearly don&#39;t know what you&#39;re talking about. </p>

<ol>
<li>There is nothing wrong with arching. It puts your shoulders in a safe position and lets you press more weight. As a powerlifter, that&#39;s what I care about. </li>
<li>I train submaximally. This is my first workout after dropping my training max 3 cycles to focus more on volume work. You don&#39;t need to train near your max to see progress. Slow, consistent progress is the name of the game and in a few months I&#39;m going to crush my current 1rms. My 203lbs that I benched in comp? I very likely could have done more but it was my first comp so I was being conservative.</li>

<div class="md"><p>I compete in powerlifting, that makes me a powerlifter. What part of training intelligently confuses you? You don&#39;t need to hit 10/10 grinder sets in order to see  strength gains.</p>

<div class="md"><p>Again if you compete in powerlifting with this form, at this weight, lifting this amount of weight….</p>

<p>I’m just gonna stop engaging right there. This video says enough lol</p>

<div class="md"><p>I do compete with this form and I got 3 white lights on each of my attempts, all with heavier weights. So there&#39;s nothing wrong with it.</p>

<div class="md"><p>Nope, in the open division. I was the weakest person at the meet but I still got encouragement and fist bumps from everyone. It was absolutely incredible. Are you just jealous that someone is actually trying and pushing themselves to compete? </p>

<p>So you must be what? 140ish? I&#39;m guessing you&#39;re a skinny twig.</p>
