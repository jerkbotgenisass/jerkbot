Let's talk about the Turkish Get Up

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>My understanding is that the TGU is mostly about time spent under tension, so my goal should be to complete the movement as slowly (and as smoothly) as possible. However, I see a lot of videos posted - not form checks - where people seem to be getting through them pretty quick (and jerky), so what&#39;s going on?</p>

<p>Firstly, the idea of performing the movement slow and smooth makes sense to me: greater time under tension = greater effort = greater strength. Equally, smoother movement = greater control = greater strength.</p>

<p>On the one hand, I get that some people are using a heavy weight, in which case they might be moving faster than they would ideally like to. Fair enough. On the other hand, some of these videos are titled things like &quot;feeling good&quot;, and the comments are full of praise, so I assume they&#39;re happy with their performance.</p>

<p>So my question is this: am I missing something? How do you perform the TGU?/What do you think the ideal TGU looks like? I&#39;m genuinely interested to read other people&#39;s views on this.</p>

<p>N.B. My knowledge of kettlebells comes mainly from Simple &amp; Sinister and Enter the Kettlebell, so I&#39;m aware that I might be looking at things through a very hardstyle/Pavel focused lens; and maybe I just need to look around more. Recommendations welcome.</p>

<div class="md"><p>LOL, yeah, so this is wrong. If you look at what the correlation between cross sectional muscle size and strength it&#39;s like 0.9. So sure, it&#39;s potential strength, but your point is pretty silly to make here since it&#39;s the best predictor of strength.</p>

<div class="md"><p>Drewbob’s point is not silly, it’s the crux of the whole discussion. Recruiting muscle fibers is the name of the game for strength. Building muscle is then useful when you want more muscle to recruit. But only training like a bodybuilder is not the move if you have Olympic powerlifting aspirations. </p>

<p>Bodybuilders get big and strong, but mostly big. Powerlifters get big and strong, but mostly strong.</p>

<div class="md"><blockquote>
<p>Before going any further, I’d just like to point out that training with a focus on gaining mass to dominate at powerlifting is directly supported in the literature. One study found that in elite level powerlifters, <strong><em>performance in all three lifts was strongly correlated (r=0.8-0.9 for some) to muscle thickness in the prime movers</em></strong> (although bizarrely, it was most strongly correlated to subscapularis thickness in all three lifts, just as an aside). <strong><em>Another, hot off the presses, found again that one of the strongest predictors of performance in national-level lifters was muscle mass per unit height. Big is strong.</em></strong></p>

<div class="md"><p>“Big is strong” is an absolute that is obviously not correct. Those studies are showing that powerlifters who are big AND train for strength are stronger than powerlifters who train for strength but are not so big. I mean, no kidding, right? </p>

<p>Really, all anyone has to do to prove you wrong is find a person who is stronger than someone a little more muscular than them. The world is absolutely littered with folks like that.</p>

<p>And I mean, why aren’t more bodybuilders on the powerlifting podium in serious competition? You telling me no bodybuilder ever looked at the records and thought, holy shit, I’ll just go win the Olympics because I’m huge?</p>
