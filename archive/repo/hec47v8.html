<div class="md"><p>The idea of an arch is to create a stable position for your shoulders. Your arch makes them tight and secure so that you don&#39;t injure them. Those youtubers and tiktokers making fun of them are either:</p>

<li>Making fun of EXTREME arches. Extreme arches are designed to limit ROM for powerlifting, rather than just for stability. However  they are permitted under IPF rules, so if someone wants to use extreme arches then that is their prerogative.</li>

<div class="md"><p>This is not correct. By arching your back you are not activating your chest muscles as they should. 
To avoid injury and maximise full motion reps, you have to close your scapulas. You do not arch your back and you only have to focus on two things in bench press:</p>

<ul>
<li>Scapulas closed</li>
<li>Feet grounded on the floor</li>

<p>By arching your back you are not activating your chest muscles as they should</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Bench press doesn&#39;t utilize the entirety of the chest regardless of your form, but when you&#39;re arching you are literally pushing out your chest to maximise its activation. If you want full activation, then you need to do dumbbell bench press, because your arm movement is less limited.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Scapulas closed</p>
</blockquote>

<p>How do you keep your scapulas closed on a heavy set? Form breaks down the heavier you go. By not having an arch, you&#39;re body might release your scapula to push through the rep. It physically can&#39;t do that when your back is arched and is forcing your scapula in position. You can say &quot;I just focus on keeping it closed&quot;, and that might work for you. But its better for the majority of lifters to limit any chance of a form breakdown.</p>

<div class="md"><p>No, when you are arching you are changing the angle in which the muscle does the motion. In other words by arching your back you are asking you lower chest to work more than the upper-medium one. </p>

<p>You do not arch the back, at least not the way the guy is doing it on the video. I get it doesn’t have to be flat out on the bench, but forcing an arch that is not the natural one of your vertebra isn’t good in bench pressing. You might still be able to work your chest, but you are slowing down the progress.</p>

<p>Edit:</p>

<p>If you don’t close your scapulas, you’ll end up asking your rear delt and back a lot more work than they should.</p>

<div class="md"><p>This is so dumb. It’s like an art critic is analysing a Michelangelo and someone who is listening to his critique asks to paint it himself to prove what he is saying. </p>

<p>I don’t need to be Arnold S. to understand his form is not correct, and yes his back is extremely arched (contrarily to someone else below in the comments who wants to believe differently).</p>

<p>For the sake of the argument, arching your back during bench press increases the risk of injury, period. It doesn’t matter how many times you guys tell in your head it doesn’t, it does. </p>

<p>Only powerlifters arch the back to lift more but they don’t reach full motion range and they must own the proper form (natural back) before beginning arching. OP isn’t mastering the form as he is insecure and asks opinions online, and you can see from the video.</p>

<p>Whether I’m able to push more than this guy or not (I genuinely don’t know as I don’t do max reps) won’t make a difference to the argument “should you arch your back or not”. To end with you guys need to be careful to state certain things because you make people believe they can do it like that when only a few actually can afford to arch the back. You are indirectly responsible for people’s injuries, something to think about before you go to sleep.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5504579/">This study</a> actually showed slightly more upper chest activation in the decline bench when compared with incline.
