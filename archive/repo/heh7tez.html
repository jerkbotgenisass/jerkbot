WR Survey Results - The Deadlift

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I touched on this a <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/weightroom/comments/pr0wpa/september_19_daily_thread/hdh5nwj/?utm_source=reddit&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3">few days ago</a> before the heat maps really coalesced as something that would be infinitely useful (or just plain cool). So <em>some of this</em> has already been read, but I hope to show you something new.</p>

<p>Additionally, this is deadlifting. These numbers are probably with straps and might even include a deadlift suit and, definitely, include people pulling sumo. So think about these numbers as <strong>Strongman, but with Sumo</strong>.</p>

<p>We should have asked about pulling stance; that would have been cool.</p>

<h1>Height/Weight Relationship to Deadlifts</h1>

<p><a href="https://imgur.com/VwjnqU3">Here is the heat map</a>, but I think the more fun one is <a href="https://imgur.com/tZQ5jJl">actually this one</a>. It shows you how clustered the user base gets around that 190-200 lb bodyweight at ~6 ft tall. And how disparate a lot of the other combinations can really be. We already know what the big piece of advice is going to be: you can&#39;t get taller, so get heavier. That said, if you&#39;re pulling more than ~425, you are already in the top 50% of lifters by Deadlift Weight. Pulling more than 500? You&#39;re in the top 25%.</p>

<p>Once again, here is the &quot;<a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1t1n_KFQgouN3poB5SjtaPNsgP32WJJyqXFinbDDfc7Q/edit?usp=sharing">Where do I stack up</a>&quot; spreadsheet.</p>

<p>One thing to note, and this is why I included the 2nd heatmap here: There are only ~30 users in the 242 weight class; there are ~70 in the 231, and ~200 in the 220, and far too many users &gt;68 inches tall in the under 220 (198) weight class. The result of this is less data in those cells to reference.</p>

<p>And one of the weird trends? The 231 class is, on average, stronger, than our 242 class. <strong>This is troubling</strong>. My current belief is that the 242 MEAT FRIDGES aren&#39;t numerous enough, but I&#39;m going to look deeper into this later (and might not post about it outside of the daily threads).</p>

<h1>Training Time</h1>

<p><a href="https://imgur.com/mdux3Dq">Is my deadlift any good</a>?</p>

<p>I&#39;ll explain again how this chart is used: go to your bodyweight rounded to the nearest 10 lbs and then move over the number of years you&#39;ve been training. If you are stronger than the number there, your lift is good. If you are not as strong as you could be, consider the <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/weightroom/comments/oyydr1/on_meat_fridges_and_diet_lettuce_boys/">Gospel of the Weightroom</a>: <strong>B U L K T O 2 4 2.</strong> Based on the data we collected, maybe 231 would be okay? But I&#39;d rather you strive for greatness!</p>

<h1>Does Hanging Around in <a href="/r/Weightroom">r/Weightroom</a> Help Your Deadlift?</h1>

<p>Those that spend any amount of time in the daily thread know that our form checks are pretty awesome. <a href="/u/DadliftsnRuns">u/DadliftsnRuns</a> has given some of the best Sumo Advice I&#39;ve ever gotten 2nd hand. And it&#39;s blown up my sumo! So anecdotally, yeah - hanging around in this place has made me a stronger lifter.</p>

<p>Look: <a href="/r/Weightroom">r/Weightroom</a> regulars are strong. If you want to be strong, you gotta surround yourself with strong people.</p>

<p>For clarity, all this shows is that the regulars in <a href="/r/Weightroom">r/Weightroom</a> happen to be strong. But many of us should take this as a &quot;If you hang out in <a href="/r/Weightroom">r/Weightroom</a>, you can add a few pounds to the bar.&quot; You still gotta put in the work in the gym, but the friends you make here can definitely make the process more fun.</p>

<h1>What About Those Weirdos with a Deadlift &lt; Squat?</h1>

<p><a href="https://imgur.com/mE5lQRW">Yeah. Those people.</a> We had ~8% of people (54) report a squat bigger than their deadlift. 53 were male. They had an average weight of 205 and an average height of 70.5 inches, so nothing of note there.</p>

<p>The average squat among the group was 396 and the average deadlift was 365. The worst ratio was a 275 squat/615 deadlift and a 123 squat/421 deadlift. Both users were shamed.</p>

<p>This is where the women have really shined, which is surprising. I would have expected a lot more women in the squat (what with all the <em>women are better at squatting</em> noise).</p>

<p><strong>How big do I have to get?</strong></p>

<h1>Conclusions</h1>

<p>As with all of these so far, <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/weightroom/comments/ptzgbq/wr_survey_results_the_bench_press/">The Bench</a> &amp; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/weightroom/comments/pujvxw/wr_survey_results_all_the_squats/">The Squats</a>, it&#39;s important to remember that this is a snapshot of discrete individuals at a single moment. We don&#39;t know what people did or even how reliable their numbers are.</p>

<p>I filled out the Survey on the first day it was posted in April and listed my 1RM deadlift as 470 lbs. At the time of the survey, my best deadlift to date was <em>actually</em> 455 lbs, but I had pulled and dropped 470 in a meet in January. I went on to pull 475 in late April (raw) and 495 in May (straps). So even my numbers weren&#39;t as &quot;real&quot; as they might have been.</p>

<p>In any case, I think the trend is clear: you can&#39;t change your age or your height or even how long you&#39;ve been training <em>up til now</em>. But you can change your weight and people in higher weight classes tend to lift more. If you want to be more competitive, you&#39;re gonna want to gain that weight.</p>

<p>As always, here is the <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1H3bD__jwxmNOnlFwvltC_6LAxE3KUvA_rhC32qVflyk/edit?usp=sharing">Deadlift Data Sheet</a>.</p>
