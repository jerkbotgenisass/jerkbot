<p>This sub has helped me so much in the past 9 months. Have put on 45lbs bulking (relatively) clean, feel exponentially stronger, and feel more confident than ever before. Found 531 for beginners on the wiki, plugged in my numbers, and have stuck with it with no excuses or exceptions for 9 months. Consistency is key. I just want to say thank you to all the members of this community that help to assist and motivate others. I truly believe if I can do it anyone can. </p>

<p>Lifts ( all lifts are in lbs )</p>

<p>Squat- 185 x 1 - 255 x 7</p>

<p>Bench- 95 x 5 - 155 x 7</p>

<p>Deadlift- 295 x 1 - 395 x1 </p>

<p>OHP- 85 x 1 - 125 x 1 </p>

<p>I&#39;d be happy to answer any questions about diet, program, accessories, etc if any of you have any! Anyway, thanks again for all of your insight and motivation!</p>

<div class="md"><p>Nice job but you also lost all muscle definition that you had before, you might want to start cutting right now and get to around 12% bodyfat and then start bulking again</p>
