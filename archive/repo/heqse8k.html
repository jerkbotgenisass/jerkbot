<div class="md"><p>Deadlifting 350 with that bad of form puts your true max around 315. Still impressive for someone who never works out and is built like a noodle. That being said, you have to fix your form.
1. Take the slack out of the bar. You just gripped it and jerked really hard to get the bar off the floor initially. It’s partially why your lower back rounded so much. Your pull should be smooth and continuous.
2. Brace your core. Watch the vid again and look at your midsection. It caves inwards immediately. To keep your back straight, keep your core tight. See Alan Thrall on YT for videos explaining this.
3. Keep your head in a neutral position. Don’t look at the ceiling, look slightly up. This will help with back rounding.
4. Start with the bar closer. Your first movement was pulling the bar closer to your legs and then pulling upwards. Your shins should be an inch away from the bar before you pull. The bar should be in contact with your legs or extremely close to them as you pull it upwards.
5. Consider changing your grip. It’s common for sumo pullers to have the bar drift side to side when they pull with a mixed grip. This is dangerous. Consider switching to a hook grip to fix this. If you really want to pull with a mixed grip, you have to really practice to keep the bar straight.
6. Lower the weight. Don’t max out until you have the form totally down.</p>
