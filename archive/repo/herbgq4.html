I actually think most of the top athletes aren’t on PEDs

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Here’s why:</p>

<p>I’m 38 and have been doing CrossFit for almost 10 years. I wasn’t an athlete growing up, I don’t have particularly impressive genetics, and I started “late”. In spite of that, I’m kind of fit. Top 20% in the open each year. </p>

<p>I only train 4-5 days a week, I eat well and sleep as well as someone with a two-year old can. Yesterday I only trained for 7 minutes and 19 seconds because it’s what I had time for. I’ve never taken any PEDs, don’t supplement, and haven’t even had caffeine in about 15 years.</p>

<p>With all of that, I’m still fitter 10 years later and improving incrementally year over year. It doesn’t feel impossible to me that people who dedicate their lives to exercise and nutrition can perform at an elite level without PEDs if I can be “above average” with all of the above constraints on my time and energy. </p>

<p>Obviously none of “know” anything beyond our own experience but I’m inclined to give the benefit of the doubt based on my experiences with CrossFit as a casual, but passionate, athlete. </p>

<p>TL;DR - I’m kind of fit and only try kind of hard. Seems to me that people who try really hard can be really fit without cheating.</p>

<div class="md"><p>You are wrong. Search youtube for &quot;natty or not&quot; Tons of fitness experts make videos on athletes who claim natty. The more you watch, the more clues you pick up on how to spot them. I&#39;m now convinced that <strong>more</strong> people are on PEDs than anyone realizes. I bet a lot crossfit gyms have people using PEDs amongst them.</p>
