<div class="md"><p>On a real note though, if you are trying to get in shape never listen to this fool. He uses fake weights, heâ€™s in the closet about his steroid use, and he promotes some obscure ass workouts while at the same time knocking the known and effective ones.</p>

<div class="md"><p>If you are trying to get in shape the chances are you aren&#39;t exactly the most muscular person. Sure this guy wouldn&#39;t make you look like him (steroids and all) but with most Americans, going to the gym for 30 minutes 3 times a week doing a random athlean video is still infinitely better than sitting around and not knowing where to start.</p>

<div class="md"><p>No this is wrong. What you need to is be able to take what he says with a grain of salt and be able to think critically about what he says. He is very good at anatomy and where muscles are and what their purpose is, many of his exercise are pretty good, but you need to understand why he recommends them. He doesn&#39;t really knock the known and effective ones (for a few, but that is just because they are difficult to do safely with full ROM), but he suggests about the amount or frequency of them. He says that push ups are killing your gains, but in reality what he says is that doing 100 pushups a day with no progressive overload is killing your gains.</p>

<p>He says that if you want to build your back, do pullups. Literally everyone agrees with this, but by your logic you wouldn&#39;t listen to him. </p>

<p>By saying don&#39;t listen to him is effectively gatekeeping the fitness community.</p>

<div class="md"><p>Nah I gotta agree with the libleft</p>

<p>AthleanX&#39;s videos are filled with a fuckton of BS, not <em>all</em> of it is BS because, as you may know, even a broken clock is right twice a day</p>

<p>Listening to what he says can be dangerous, especially for newbies, since he spouts a lot of unscientific clickbaity content just for views and to sell his products</p>

<p>Listening to AthleanX is quite literally killing your gains</p>
