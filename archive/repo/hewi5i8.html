<div class="md"><p>You got too excited to respond without realizing I elaborated further in a conversation that happened <em>four hours ago</em>. Maybe you should degrees in calming the fuck down and reading on before responding like a maniac.</p>

<div class="md"><p>It is absolutely okay to wear a mask when you’re squatting and deadlifting you god damn mongoloid. Maybe not if you’re doing high reps (I covered that already) but having a cloth over your mouth while you push out one heavy rep isn’t going to do anything. You’re telling me you couldn’t pull 90% of your max DL right now if you were wearing a mask?</p>

<p>You’ve got all those degrees but no common sense smh</p>

<div class="md"><p>Ah resorting to name calling AGAIN. Clearly a man of high intelligence here. First I’m an idiot now I’m a mongoloid. If you’re wearing a face mask properly then you simply would not be able to take in the same amount of air because the mask would stick to your face. If you’re wearing it improperly then yeah sure I could, but then that defeats the point of wearing of face mask in the first place LMAO.</p>
