<div class="md"><p>Someone once told me that incline, flat, and decline bench presses was all I needed to build a bigger, better chest. Should I take that same advice and transfer it to delts, or are lateral/anterior raises more efficient? </p>

<p>Bonus question, even though I’m dropping a bit of weight, is the Arnold press a rotation off of dumbbell press? Kind of feels like it gives the best of both worlds, which is rad since I don’t really know anything else that activates the posterior head without forcing me into some uncomfortable position.</p>

<div class="md"><p>For delts I personally alternate between a &quot;power&quot; day where I do OHP with a barbell one day with 4 sets of low reps at heavy weight(I&#39;m at 190lbs currently, I don&#39;t know how I stack up to other people) and then the next  shoulder day I do lateral raises/face pulls at a very low weight for a bunch of reps very slowly. Look up the PHUL workout in the FAQ in this sub and that&#39;ll give you kind of an idea what I&#39;m talking about.   </p>

<p>Doing it this way has given me INSANE size gains on my shoulders after struggling just doing OHP for a long time.   </p>

<p>Hopefully this at least anecdotally answers your question haha.   </p>

<p>Bonus: I would avoid the Arnold Press at all costs because it forces your rotator cuff into an awkward position and awkward means injury at higher weights. Incline bench press will work for your anterior delts and it&#39;s a much safer movement for the longevity of your joints.</p>

<p>That’s silly.  Our bodies are made to be in awkward positions.  Even if it does have a greater injury risk, that injury risk is still so minuscule as to be nearly nonexistent.</p>

<div class="md"><p>Put an 80 pound dumbbell in each hand and rotate your shoulder in a way that grinds the ball of the humerus against the rotator cuff repeatedly and then try again with telling me the risk is miniscule lol   </p>

<p>You can get the exact same (or better) results with other exercises so why risk it?</p>
