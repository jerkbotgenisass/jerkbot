<div class="md"><p>Getting signed to the MCU is signing away your rights to eat anything but chicken breasts and vegetables for possibly the next 15 years of your life. Even if offered 20 mil per film, I don&#39;t think I could do that, nutritionists or no. I like cheese WAY more than I like money.</p>

<p>So shoutout to everyone putting their personal gratification on hold to give us some seriously kickass films.</p>

<div class="md"><p>lol what, actors absolutely alter their weight and lifestyle in between films and marvel actors are no exception. even guys like hemsworth that need to be huge to play Thor fluctuate in size between films. it&#39;s not easy but they&#39;re not just living off lentils for 15 years. being able to take 3+ hours a day for lifting and cardio makes eating normally a lot more realistic.</p>
