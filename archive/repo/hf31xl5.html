<div class="md"><p>No you didn&#39;t. Look we know youre not strong because you&#39;re too much of a coward to post your lifts, we know you don&#39;t look like you lift because you post in bodyweight fitness. At best you did a weekend soccer conditioning course,a sport where Ronaldo is considered jacked and you learnt about Nordic curls and single leg dumbbell deadlifts with 10kg. So get the fuck in your lane and stop squeezing out your useless advice.</p>

<div class="md"><p>If you KNOW this why track back through my posts? You see I&#39;m guessing you lift like a lady and are over compensating in your posts because the strength to taps the keys on your phone is all you can muster. I don&#39;t have to tell you anything about my qualifications, workplace or lifts to prop up your insecurities. If you are so sure you are correct why are you in such a rush to make sure you invalidate others. Is it possibly because you are not sure of yourself? Need validation from others like you? </p>

<p>You&#39;re guessing at my degree but you are cocksure because you &quot;competed&quot;. It&#39;s fools like you that are the problem in the gym world. People with barely 2 brain cells to rub together who circle jerk each other and never actually learn anything.</p>

<div class="md"><p>I have figured it out, spoiler alert, I disagree with you because I think you’re wrong.</p>

<p>Irony:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>the expression of one&#39;s meaning by using language that normally signifies the opposite, typically for humorous or emphatic effect.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>You think you’re being ironic by pretending to be stupid (which is inherently stupid) and your ongoing attempt to be pedantic (and failing) further proves ironic in an interesting way...</p>

<p>Also Irony: </p>

<blockquote>
<p>a state of affairs or an event that seems deliberately contrary to what one expects and is often amusing as a result.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Your attempts to outsmart anyone here have only made you look stupid. So it’s amusing that you’re getting the opposite of the intended result. </p>

<p>I think I have a solid grasp on how irony works.</p>
