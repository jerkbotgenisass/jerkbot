<div class="md"><p>I am about to go back to the gym after almost a month of dealing with Rhabdomolyosis which is a fatal conditition that can be caused from over extortion in the muscles or just muscle damage overall, I was very close on being on dialysis for the rest of my life and thus cant really do anything other than live my life at home. Thankfully it was caught in time and only needed rest.</p>

<p>&#x200B;</p>

<p>To take in perspective how damaging rhabdomolyosis is; after taking a blood test i had multiple enzymes that were insanely off the charts, first was Creatine Kensine(I dont use creatine btw, this is a natural enzyme) an average person has a max of 178 I had... 23008.</p>

<p>Be safe guys, dont think going extra is always good.</p>

<div class="md"><p>What were you doing to get to that point? I dont think there has ever been a clinical diagnosis of rhabdo from weight lifting.</p>

<div class="md"><p>There has been, but it&#39;s uncommon and usually due to more Crossfit-y stuff rather than regular lifting. Usually rhabdo happens in older people who fall and are down for awhile before being found, or people who are incapacitated from using substances. Rhabdo can cause sufficient renal damage to require dialysis. I think for OP it wasn&#39;t just one day or curls, it sounds like a couple of days of overwork led to the muscle damage. </p>

<p>I think your larger point that is valid, though, that most reasonable and sensible people don&#39;t need to be overly concerned about rhabdo. I&#39;m a nurse and while I&#39;ve had patients with exercise-induced rhabdo, I&#39;ve had far more patients who were deconditioned elderly folks who fell and couldn&#39;t get up.</p>

<div class="md"><p>Oh there is, doctors told me this isnt a rare occurance and a month before I went there a 22 year old girl unfortunately had to go to dialysis for the rest of her life because of too much weight lifting.</p>

<p>My main issue was, I didnt go to the gym during august due to vacation and summer stuff, so once i started in september I continued with my usual tempo, to make matters worst I did so much curls that day to the point where im pretty sure my arms died, and overall I really overworked my entire arm.</p>

<p>I took a break after the arm curls cause they were literally stuck and I couldnt really move them other than a 90degree position. The day after i still overworked my back and shoulders. I was lucky cause I needed just a normal check up and had to get a blood test that had nothing to do with this, when the doctors saw my results they urgently sent me to an intensive care unit for more exams.</p>

<div class="md"><p>Yea so I am basically 100% certain this isn&#39;t really the case. You aren&#39;t going to get rhabdo from doing curls and no 22 yr old is going to go on life long dailysis either. There is either an underlying medical condition completely separate from the training or this is exaggeration</p>

<div class="md"><p>Well that&#39;s what all the doctor&#39;s told me, went to multiple and yeah. But I don&#39;t have any other medical conditions.</p>
