<div class="md"><p>also, this is the calendar division. the average fireman is equally competent, but less attractive</p>

<div class="md"><p>You can still only work out a couple of hours at most 6 days a week before overtraining.</p>

<div class="md"><p>Depends on the split and what you&#39;re putting in your body. Also, only the most devoted person will go to the gym for multiple hours every single day while also holding a full time job. That&#39;s literally your entire free time. These guys can just work it into their job.</p>

<div class="md"><p>That&#39;s a fair point, yes but if you look like this it&#39;s also a passion not a chore. Yesterday was my rest day and I couldn&#39;t wait for today to get back in. </p>

<p>It&#39;s not different than putting passion into another hobby like art or music, or even gaming or tv (other than health benefits of course).</p>

<div class="md"><p>It&#39;s not about the duration, it&#39;s about the frequency. If you work out every day with weights you&#39;ll get massive regardless</p>

<div class="md"><p>Yes. I do.  </p>

<p>My point is more that it&#39;s not some unattainable body for normal people like many redditors believe. You don&#39;t have to be able to dedicate each and every day to working out. Many well regarded programs are only 4 days a week and an hour to an hour and a half is enough.</p>

<div class="md"><p>And if you worked out 2 hours a day, 6 days a week, consistently, you&#39;d look like that. Most people don&#39;t have the time.</p>

<div class="md"><p>Even then, your average gym-goer will almost never have to worry about “overtraining” (unless their lifting routine is dogshit). Inadequate rest and subpar nutrition are, unfortunately, far more common.</p>
