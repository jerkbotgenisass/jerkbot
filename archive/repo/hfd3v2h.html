<div class="md"><p>When bodybuilding, people refer to keeping constant tension. Is this something you actively do (like do I focus on keeping the tension on my muscles so I can feel it) or do I just move the weight and it does it automatically?</p>

<div class="md"><p>You are under tension if you are moving the weight. Constant tension would be avoiding lockout or any position where the weight is “resting,” which is more applicable to cables and machines than barbell work.</p>

<p>Do not ever worry about “feeling” a muscle. If you do movement, muscle worked.</p>

<div class="md"><p><a href="https://www.strongerbyscience.com/internal-cues/">When trying to lift explosively, actively focusing on using the pecs or triceps didn’t affect muscle activation.
Trying to press the weight explosively resulted in more muscle activation than pressing the weight slowly, regardless of cues.</a></p>

<p>Time under tension doesn&#39;t affect hypertrophy either: <a href="https://www.strongerbyscience.com/can-we-predict-muscle-growth/">https://www.strongerbyscience.com/can-we-predict-muscle-growth/</a></p>

<div class="md"><p>Just wanna come back and clarify I was referring to hypertonic muscles dominating the prime movers which literally restricts the muscle from being engaged to the degree they should be</p>

<div class="md"><p>Idk why you’re trying to assume my stance and disprove it? Different aspects of fitness are optimal in different scenarios. I offered the most relevant advice to op. Lifting explosively would not be the most beneficial method for a bodybuilder if that’s what you are saying. Hopefully op found something that makes sense trying to dig through your posts trying to prove you know more than other people</p>
