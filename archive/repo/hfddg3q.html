<div class="md"><p>My man then why are you cutting and bulking? Getting bigger putting on more muscle, lifting heavier and overall being stronger then cutting down, starving yourself and losing majority of your gained strength and muscle in the process just to rinse and repeat it again. My best advice would be for you to eat slightly above maintenance, just enough so you can continue to build muscle and at the same time stay at you ideal body fat. You probably know what I’m talking about “maingaining”</p>

<div class="md"><p>Eating slightly above maintaince is bulking.</p>

<p>Maingaining isn&#39;t a real thing. You&#39;re bulking or cutting or just staying the same.</p>

<div class="md"><p>Maingaining is a real thing. Its just that its only really possible when you&#39;ve already got a bit of a high body fat % to burn as excess energy or you&#39;re coming in as a complete beginner. </p>

<p>Its still technically possible to lean gain even for experienced lifters, by bulking with a very marginal surplus so that you only gain a couple of pounds of fat which is easy enough to lose. Its just incredibly inefficient compared to a 10-20% calorie surplus bulk/cut cycle.</p>

<div class="md"><p>As far as I know op isn’t competing in any bodybuilding shows and doesn’t need to bulk and cut, to build muscle you don’t need to be in caloric surplus. He should try to build at maintenance and then gradually add in a bit more like 200-300 calories. At the end of the day this is just my personal advice and whatever op decides on doing is completely up to him.</p>
