<div class="md"><p>I bet none of these￼￼ people making fun of the brain damage do any heavy contact sports. Sports like Fighting, American Football are definitely not for everyone. Things like professional MMA those fighters love fighting and a lot of the times it’s their passion and only thing they want to do. They acknowledge they’ll get concussed, broken bones, hurt, and worse case somehow die. But it’s their choice. It may not be entertaining to the others but for us it is! You stay safe man, wear your gear and don’t get hit! Haha how to extend your fighting career 101, don’t get hit 4head</p>

<div class="md"><p>Your entire response to the above seemed to be answering the basketball/football comment or you just decided not to acknowledge it. </p>

<p>And regardless of what’s worse, brain damage of all sorts would be considered similar to me and football is proven to cause it. That’s assuming this sport causes any brain damage. Maybe it’s safer than football??</p>

<p>And I realize you didn’t make this claim since you didn’t mention football but many would consider something “better” meaning “not as damaging to society” if it’s nationally accepted and popular. You saying this doesn’t look fun and they’re just hurting themselves has as much merit as someone saying the same about football. But like I said, I’m sure most would accept football over this, which is the problem I have with that way of thinking.</p>

<div class="md"><p>I’m not a big fan of the level of injury that can occur from combat sports in general. </p>

<p>But come on, at least in those sports it’s just your fists and not a fucking axe lol. </p>

<p>There is so much more than can go wrong here.</p>

<div class="md"><p>I would assume that these weapons are not sharp. I think blunt force trauma with an axe to the head is comparable to a professional boxer hitting you in the face. </p>

<p>Is this stupid? Most definitely. But by saying this is an excuse to hurt other people the same might just as well be said for every combat sport.</p>

<div class="md"><p>Naw turns out it’s actually pretty hard to hurt someone in full armor like that. I’m sure getting hit in the head sucks but like, people get straight kicked in the head in MMA with no helmet. </p>

<p>And like, look man, people can choose what they wanna do with their lives. The adrenaline rush that comes from combat sports is unlike any other, and I can’t fault someone choosing to spend their life that way.</p>
