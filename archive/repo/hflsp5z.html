<div class="md"><p>Lean = reduction in body fat %. You can’t do that whilst wanting to put on muscle mass which requires a calorie surplus. </p>

<p>Go for a ‘lean bulk’ 200-300 calorie surplus daily, with help muscle build and won’t out on too much fat.</p>

<div class="md"><p>? Completely false lmao. </p>

<p>As a &quot;noobie&quot; u can easily put on muscle and lose fat at the same time. Its even possible doing that as an advance gym goer. </p>

<p>Make sure u get enough protein in and be in a slight deficit. Its called body recomposition. </p>

<p>Keep hitting the gym using progressive overload. And u will see change in no time.</p>

<p>Good luck.</p>

<div class="md"><p>Be in a deficit? This guy? Have you looked at the photo? He&#39;s already skinny, do you want him to look like a holocaust survivor? This dude is not going to look good losing weight no matter how good his BF% gets. He needs some mass.</p>

<div class="md"><p>Yes, you&#39;re skinny fat, emphasis on skinny. I don&#39;t know why someone who&#39;s skinny would want to lose weight. You even said in your post you want to put on more weight. Deficit is literally the opposite of that. </p>

<p>Your focus should be on building muscle right now. If you try to go into deficit and lean out at this weight then even if you&#39;re successful you&#39;ll just look like a skeleton.</p>
