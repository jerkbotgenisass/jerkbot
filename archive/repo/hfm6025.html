<div class="md"><p>20ish pounds in 4 months seems pretty reasonable. Anyone thinking this transformation is impossible without steroids is a goober</p>

<div class="md"><p>If he&#39;s new to lifting it&#39;s not unreasonable to put on 1lb/wk. You are right in that this does taper off as they get to year 1, 2, 3 and so on.</p>

<div class="md"><p>20 lbs is borderline excessive for anyone in 4 months, and thereâ€™s no way this dude doesnâ€™t come out looking fatter if he didnâ€™t use roids</p>

<div class="md"><p>It very obviously wasnâ€™t all muscle lol. It doesnâ€™t take years to put on 20lbs. He is also clearly not flexing very hard in the first picture and is spreading in the second.</p>
