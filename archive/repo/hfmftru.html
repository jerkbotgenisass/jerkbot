<div class="md"><p>You can reasonably expect to hit 225 on bench in your first year of dedicated lifting. It&#39;s not shitting on others, it&#39;s still a great milestone, it&#39;s just pointing out the fact that you look like a giant tool if you&#39;re bragging about something that 99% of people can do with just a little bit of time and effort.</p>

<div class="md"><p>Eh, depends on weight. 1 year dedicated lifting that 160lb kid will have a hard time of it getting to 225. In the real world 225 is considered respectable. 275 is top 5%, 315 is elite level. But walk into a powerlifting gym 315 bench is entry level.</p>

<p>But yes, I agree, dude in vid is a huge douche canoe. He should know by now numbers on weights impresses the guys more than the girls.</p>

<div class="md"><p>No, they mean reps. But most of these guys are exaggerating or outright lying. Like gamers that say git gud - most either are terrible or had to go no lifer for longer than they admit. Same with these guys - a lot of them probably don&#39;t lift at all and the rest are humble brag lying because it actually took them years.</p>

<p>Still - 3 years to get to 150 sounds excessive if you&#39;re a male. Maybe you&#39;re doing something wrong. You should seek advice (not advice on Reddit - this is one of the worst sites).</p>

I do some powerlifting and i cheer on and are very impressed when people get to their goals no matter the weight. But 225 if it is pounds is not very impressive for a grown man. Its good, but not very impressive.</p>

If 225 is a goal or milestone for someone, that’s great and I hope they achieve it.

<div class="md"><p>I believe the distinction is between &quot;225 as a major progression goal&quot; and &quot;225 means I&#39;m super yoked&quot;. The first part IS true, and a 225 press is often used as a measure of potential success with professional sports rookies. However, it is also a very achievable goal for male athletes, so the TikTok user&#39;s assertion that 225 is a milestone in which Random Beach Goer#37913 should feel imasculated at his approach is a little ridiculous.</p>

<div class="md"><p>Depends on your weight/age/gender. Also are you including the bar? Or do you mean 50kg? Everyone here is sayin 225 lbs because that guy doesn&#39;t look like he can bench 225kg, and also 225lbs is a typical goal for aspiring lifters as it&#39;s 2 plates on each side of the bar.</p>

<p>But as to your original question, if you are strength training with the intent to be as strong as possible 225 lbs is unfortunately not impressive. I&#39;d say you can get an average man up to that weight within a year no problem if you took it seriously. No need to compare yourself to others though, especially if you&#39;re just lifting to stay active.</p>

<div class="md"><p>If you mean 50lb&#39;s then you are only lifting the weight of a standard bar, no weights added. 50kg is better than most people so its respectable, 100kg (225lb) shows you are on your way to impressive numbers but that level is achievable quickly and easily by men, slower for women but still nothing insane.</p>

<div class="md"><p>Yes. Because 500 lbs is attainable for normal people if they just try a little.</p>

<p>Get outta here</p>

<div class="md"><p>That was my thought.  I just started powelifting and I bench 100kg. I felt happy for a minute after seeing this clip, but you have reassured me of my shame.</p>

<div class="md"><p>I wouldnt say it&#39;s shameful, just nothing at all to brag about. I was maxing 225 at 180lbs in HS and was only a bit above average for the seniors on my football team and we sucked ass.</p>

<div class="md"><p>Haha, all the people who belittle the douche because he can &quot;only&quot; lift 225lbs while they can bench waay more...</p>

<p>He&#39;s a douche for being a show-off, you&#39;re just as douchy for one upping that guy.</p>

<div class="md"><p>Nah man, completely cool to be pumped up about hitting 225, i weigh 150~ and the first time I did 4 plates for reps I was high on the andrenaline for hours, but if I then used that as a pick up line I am absolutely a douche. </p>

<p>Lifting is all about support, support your body, support your mind, support each other.</p>

<div class="md"><p>It&#39;s shameful if you think that it&#39;s so impressive that you can steal any girl. But a 225lb bench is not an easily achievable goal.</p>
