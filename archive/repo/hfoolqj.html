<div class="md"><p>You can still live a good life and be extremely disciplined. The two aren&#39;t mutually exclusive lol. </p>

<p>Did I say he didn&#39;t party? Of course he partied. What the hell is the point of doing all that work if you can&#39;t enjoy the benefits?</p>

<p>And do not tell me he ate like a pig. The man was one of the pioneers of meal-timing and macro counting. &quot;Eating like a pig&quot; means very different things for someone who&#39;s burning 3000 calories a day and someone who&#39;s sitting on their ass.</p>

<p>LOL. The dude advocated eating half an hour before working out, and eating 5 times a day with 30-50 grams a protein a meal. That&#39;s 250 grams of protein A DAY! </p>

<p>Yea, he was a real pioneer of &quot;high protein and high amino acid&quot; diets.</p>

<div class="md"><p>Yeah, IIRC he was around 235 at that point. 250 grams of protein in a day is a pretty good number for that. </p>

<p>General advice is 1 gram per pound of body weight each day. If you&#39;re really trying to build lean mass it helps to go over that</p>

<div class="md"><p>Lol, no, it&#39;s more like .5-.8 grams.  So that would mean <em>under 200</em> grams of protein for him.  Do you know how hard it is to eat 1 gram of protein per pound of body?  I&#39;ve tried, and that&#39;s like drinking 4 shakes (just under 100 grams of protein) and eating <em>on top of that</em> a pound* of steak or chicken every day. Let alone all the other things like starches and carbs.  </p>

<p>And that&#39;s still short by 50 grams of protein for that recommendation.</p>

<p>It&#39;s a horrible metric and unless you have a crazy food budget it&#39;s pointless to waste that much food for zero gain.</p>

<p>Also too much protein doesn&#39;t do anything except get excreted by the body. It doesn&#39;t really help with muscle building, according to studies.</p>

<p>There is some argument about it stressing the kidneys, but that&#39;s been debunked.  </p>

<p>Also, .8 is the recommended dosage.</p>

<p>Most recommendations are 0.8-1g of protein per pound of bodyweight. You can get away with lower amounts for bulking, but you&#39;ll want to increase it when you cut.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Do you know how hard it is to eat 1 gram of protein per pound of body? </p>

<p>Not very. I do it every day.</p>

<p>Meal 1: Four eggs, two slices of 12 grain bread with peanut butter = 46 grams</p>

<p>Meal 2: 6 ounces of chicken breast or equivalent. 52 grams</p>

<p>Meal 3: See meal 2 and add 2 cups of Fairlife milk. 78 grams</p>

<p>Meal 4: Intra-workout carb shake with protein powder. 30 grams</p>

<p>Meal 5 before bed: 150g trail mix. 16 grams.</p>

<p>222 grams of protein for the day easily. For reference I currently weigh ~185.</p>

<div class="md"><p>So your diet consists of basically a pound of chicken, milk and 2 slices of 12 grain bread and peanut butter.  No veggies or fresh fruit whatsoever. No cheeses. No wine, no beer, nothing.</p>

<p>The biggest treat is trail mix. </p>

<p>And you do this everyday?</p>

<p>You do know that Arnold would drink a pitcher of beer after his workouts right?</p>

<p>That chicken/lean ground beef/pork/whatever protein I want for the day can be a curry, stir fry, a burrito bowl, wraps, etc.</p>

<p>I often substitute trail mix for something else. Trail mix was just what I had eaten when I made my comment so I used that for convenience.</p>

<div class="md"><p>Well, I believe the macros are gonna change depending on the cut. I usually get tenderloin which is 104 grams per pound according to some data I found online as well as the my fitness pal listing for it&#39;s barcode. </p>

<p>I do a pound and a half throughout the full day and a single shake with 16 ml of 1% milk and 2 scoops of whey after a workout. It&#39;s really not difficult at all, imo, and it doesn&#39;t cause any gastrointestinal distress for me.</p>

<p>It&#39;s not like you&#39;re eating everything in a single meal and it&#39;s not like you&#39;re <em>only</em> eating the protein.</p>

<p>I&#39;d highly recommend adding in fresh veggies to the mix. Fruit is also good if you aren&#39;t doing a low carb diet</p>

<div class="md"><p>Right, but most people don’t eat a pound and a half of meat or chicken <em>everyday</em>.</p>

<p>I can do it for maybe a few days a week, sure, but to sustain that type of diet for months?  I guess I am built differently but I just firmly believe that that is an absurd amount of meat to eat over a months at a time.</p>

<div class="md"><p>Okay, but depending on your build you may not need that much. It&#39;s 1 gram per pound of body weight if you don&#39;t weigh that much, you don&#39;t need that much.</p>

<p>Also, it&#39;s not just about adding chicken or beef or whatever to the diet, it&#39;s about calorie counting and macronutrient balance.</p>

<p>What I do is I set a calorie goal, and a carb goal per day. The protein comes from my body weight and the fat goal is set to whatever extra room I have for the calorie goal</p>

<p>Yeah, you may have to cut things out, and yeah, it may take a little extra discipline, but so does having a regular exercise routine and you also need that.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t know anything about Arnold drinking a bunch of beer, but I do know the other things you&#39;ve said he did sound pretty much right for a dude his size with his body fat percentage</p>

<p>No his diet isn&#39;t for the average person and it doesn&#39;t seem maintainable because we&#39;re talking about Schwarzenegger</p>

<p>But protein per body weight is really not all that bad, and very maintainable, it just takes some planning and effort to get the meals right</p>

<div class="md"><p>I mean, first of all that being a big deal is relative. It depends on how many calories he burned/consumed daily to say if that was a significant margin </p>

<p>Second I haven&#39;t seen anyone say steroids didn&#39;t help the dude. He&#39;s ridiculously big, of course they did, lol</p>

<p>Third while I don&#39;t support drugs personally, pot by itself is 0 calories, so that&#39;s not immediately relative</p>

<li><p>You&#39;re eating drinking some pretty bad shakes then. Also a pound of chicken and a pound of beef have very different protein levels. One 16 ml shake of whey has around 40-50 grams in my experience (mine has 48 from the whey and another 16 from 1% milk</p></li>
<li><p>Every piece of advice I&#39;ve heard from body builders says 1 gram per pound, but even if that&#39;s wrong, look at your earlier metric. You said 5 meals 30-50 grams per meal. That&#39;s 150 - 250 grams per day, which also includes the value you&#39;re saying is good</p></li>

<div class="md"><p>Personally, I&#39;m straight edge and don&#39;t partake in alcohol or drugs. I understand the calories in alcohol being relevant, but why is weed? That by itself shouldn&#39;t have any effect on nutrition unless you count snacking because of it, which seems like a stereotyped assumption</p>

<div class="md"><p>It’s not a stereotype that weed makes you hungry, it’s actually biologically a side effect.  It turns off a switch in your hypothalamus that tells you you are full.  Hence the munchies.</p>

<p>And yea, that factorsnin when talking about diet discipline.</p>

<div class="md"><p>I really don&#39;t think the weed factors in. The food he may have eaten because of it, sure, but it seems like you have been taking his full diet of what he ate in a day and also adding extra food because weed on top of it, when in reality that would have been part of the food you already added</p>

<div class="md"><p>I disagree that smoking weed doesn&#39;t affect your appetite.</p>

<div class="md"><p>Didn&#39;t say that. I just said that he ate what he ate and if you&#39;re already calculating everything he ate, then you have his macronutrients and calories. How hungry he was right then doesn&#39;t matter</p>
