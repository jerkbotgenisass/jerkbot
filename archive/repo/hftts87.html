<div class="md"><p>Guy said he was recording his back - could be to record progress, could be because he’s monitoring an injury recovery. Either way, recording strangers is weird and warrants this guy reporting him to staff. If homie has a problem with him not wearing a shirt, he should go through the proper channels not stand there and film him like a pervert.</p>

<p>Also looking at comments I think this is a matter of location differences. My gym has never stopped anyone from working out shirtless and we have a few that do. Just disinfect the station after if you’re sweating a ton</p>
