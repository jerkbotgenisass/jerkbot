<div class="md"><p>Arnold was working out all the fucking time. I haven’t pushed myself nearly at his level but I’ve had periods where I was doing three grueling workouts every day, it didn’t seem like there was any amount of calories that could keep up with it. Like obviously there is, on a factual level, but I was eating junk food and just pounding away food wherever I felt slightly hungry and I was still losing weight. </p>

<p>You’re talking about someone considered to be possibly the greatest body builder of all time. It’s going to be a hard example to follow.</p>

<p>Also the dude was a known liar and genuinely did stuff for entertainment value. Especially Pumping Iron which was mostly just him playing an act.</p>

<div class="md"><p>The point is without steroids you cannot work out that much and that hard. You need to recover to build muscle <em>unless</em> you are roided out because it cuts down on recovery SIGNIFICANTLY.</p>

<div class="md"><p>Define “that much.” </p>

<p>You’re obviously going to have a higher limit on steroids but the vast majority of people can push themselves significantly harder than they do. Getting sleep and reading enough of the right food isn’t that difficult, it just takes some effort. </p>

<p>There’s certainly no reason to ever set limits for yourself. </p>

<p>“I can’t do this because I’m natty” or whatever. PROVE IT. Put in the work, find your limits. Do that for years. Only then will you have any remote idea of what your potential is nexuses you’ll have reached it.</p>

<p>Otherwise you’re just making excuses for giving up before you started.</p>

<div class="md"><p>I am in incredible shape for my age, and I&#39;ve been lifting since high school and also work as a professional stage and television actor so I&#39;m all about lifting.  I do PPLX2, 1-1/2 hours per workout is not unusual at all for me. </p>

<p>I have never touched a steroid, but I have done plenty of research and reading on it out of sheer  education and simply because it&#39;s part of bodyweight training and lifting and over decades of doing it you are just going to get info on it.  Out of that education I did a ton of research and realize the side effects aren&#39;t worth it as I still think I haven&#39;t plateaued yet. Not ruling it out for testosterone therapy becomes appropriate for my age.   With that said:</p>

<p>300-500mg weekly is plenty of juice.</p>

<p>Base line to get results is 150-200mg, but it isn&#39;t going to get you a build like Arnies.</p>

<p>Hardcore is 500mg+ which there are builders that do.  Also depends on what you are using.  Anavar and Clen for a leaner build, tren or deca if you want to go all out beast mode.</p>

<p>Any pics? Any lift videos?</p>

<p>That sounds... okay? It’s not impressive. I’m not sure what I’m supposed to get from that. </p>

<p>So should I just take your word on it because you think you know what you’re talking about? </p>

<p>I’m not sure what the point of the rest of your comment is. I’m sure why you think I’m supposed to do with that info. It’s not really relevant.</p>

<div class="md"><p>Dude, I do conditioning workouts with kettlebells that are literally 2 hours long without stopping. </p>

<p>The amount of time you lift for a session or the existence of a program isn’t impressive. How am I supposed to get any information from that? </p>

<p>What do you lift? How strong are you? What’s your physique look like? </p>

<p>I can judge those things.</p>
