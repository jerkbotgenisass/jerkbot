<div class="md"><p>If you pay attention to the background even at regular speed, it&#39;s not edited...</p>

<p>Stuff like this is absolutely doable with the right training. </p>

<p>Also the &quot;top 10 claim depends on if he&#39;s been in competitions or just generally regarded as a &quot;top tier martial artist&quot;. Without knowing his name there&#39;s no way to check</p>

<p>Edit: some of you clearly enjoy screaming &quot;fake&quot; when you don&#39;t understand something, and it shows.. also adding a mention to watch his feet, and the block placement arguments, physics 101, I shouldn&#39;t have to explain it...</p>

<div class="md"><p>It&#39;s not really super hard, if you watch the video he puts the concrete in a very specific position, leaving a bit of space behind and puts another piece in front so that it&#39;s much easier to do</p>

<p>I am not saying anyone could do this, I certainly can&#39;t, but I&#39;ve met people who could, they didn&#39;t really train that hard for it, it&#39;s just physics and using very specifically placed pieces</p>

<p>&quot;The right training&quot; =/= &quot;training super hard&quot;</p>

<p>In fact, if you&#39;re busting your shit when training for anything, you&#39;re doing it wrong. Not saying training for anything shouldn&#39;t be hard/rough/difficult, but training smart &gt; training hard no matter what</p>

<div class="md"><p>In a combat sport this is certainly good advice. If You spend all your time sparring you&#39;re going to take a lot of damage, and when you drill the object is to fine tune your technique, not to fucking decimate your partner. Definitely you would always go balls to the wall during cardio/conditioning. Smarter not harder is definitely a common cadence from good coaches.

<div class="md"><p>Came here to say this - some really high-end trainers advocate this, like Firas Zahabi: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_fbCcWyYthQ">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_fbCcWyYthQ</a></p>

<p>Depends on what you&#39;re training for I guess. Fight training camps are all about peaking at the right time, making sure you&#39;re actually able to execute. They &quot;red line&quot; the body, but only occasionally. Lots of them don&#39;t even spar in the last week or so of camp, they want to be loose and don&#39;t want to injure themselves.</p>

<div class="md"><p>On the other hand, actual combat has its advantages.</p>

<p>I have a friend who grew up in a very rough town.  He&#39;s the sweetest guy I know but you wouldn&#39;t want to pick a fight with him.  </p>

<p>He once told me that growing up the street fights were brutal so he&#39;d grown to expect broken bones if he ever got dragged into a fight.  Expecting that sort of damage meant he was prepared for it and not phased by it.  He said he found that grim experience had stood him in good stead a couple of times when someone with martial arts training had picked a fight with him.  He said they might be trained but weren&#39;t used to actual combat so were worried about getting hurt and tried to protect themselves too much.  Whereas he accepted the likelihood of injury and that freed him up to actually fight.  </p>

<p>He was the sort of guy who could be knocked down numerous times but would just get up and carry on.  I think that willingness to take damage without giving up really threw his opponents.</p>

<div class="md"><p>It&#39;s true though, why do you think they almost always have professional trainers despite how talented they were at the start? .. You can play piano for 20 years for 4 hours a day, but if you never figure how to properly use technique (which is more than simply practicing.. You have to practice properly and know how to practice) you&#39;ll never be able to play a Chopin etude at the level of experts for example.</p>

<p>1 hour of proper practice is better than 5 hours of someone just &#39;practicing&#39;. The above poster is 100% correct, arm chair memes aside.</p>

<div class="md"><p>Are they training hard for the sake of training hard, or are they also being smart about it? I probably couldve elaborated but on context of the initial reply, I was trying to focus on the &quot;training smart&quot; more</p>

<p>You can agree then, if you&#39;re training to cut down trees, you could work hard as fuck at trying to push it over or train smart and use a tool. You can do both by improving your efficiency with both the tool and technique.</p>

<p>As for sports training, you know then that someone could lift weights all day and work their ass off to gain strength as lineman in football, but without working on their technique and conditioning, they&#39;re gonna get run over every play like nothing.</p>

<p>Obviously you won&#39;t get far only doing one or the other, but if you&#39;re not being smart about your training, you&#39;re wasting your time. </p>

<p>Non physical, you can train yourself in coding for 10hrs a day, but if you&#39;re aimlessly doing practice projects you&#39;re gonna get outdone every time by someone spending half the time but getting more familiar with the details</p>

<div class="md"><p>No, you’re just completely wrong. </p>

<p>If you “train smart” with no intensity at all, your training isn’t going to do shit.</p>

<p>Someone weightlifting for example, who puts hard effort into it but does a poorly put together plan, will make far more progress than someone who has a smartly designed lifting program but puts no intensity or effort into the exercises.</p>

<div class="md"><p>Wow, so terribly misinformed. Find a single top-tier athlete that hasn’t trained their ass off to get to where they are. Sure, they might have also trained intelligently, but they absolutely trained relentlessly.</p>

<p>Why is this even a debate? No success story in relate supports your argument. Clearly haven’t ever become moderately successful at anything that require practice or training and somehow also missed watching any professional sports.</p>

<div class="md"><p>Both my parents are obsessed with martial arts, they train 3 times a week and are very fit, they love it</p>

<p>They also have a lot of friends that do martial arts, I&#39;ve been to the demonstrations and met the people who can break pieces of wood and bricks and that sort of stuff</p>

<p>I once asked one of the guys how they did it and he explained to me how it was more positioning and skill than actual strenght and showed me how it&#39;s done</p>

<div class="md"><p>Lol. That’s a inch punch and you call it not that hard? No matter how much physics or setup you do, you really can’t do it w/o years of training. He doesn’t recoil his arm. His finger tip touches the target.  Curl up his finger that’s about 2 inches away from the target. And punch at that position w/o recoil. You try that on something 1/5 the thickness and let me know. LOL.</p>
