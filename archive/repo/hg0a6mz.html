Activities that build muscle (that aren’t weightlifting)

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Bear with me here. I go to the gym every morning at 5 AM, and then go through my entire day until about 11 Pm. I have been on a 4 days on 3 off program, and have been supplementing some workouts with things I enjoy. For example, on back days, I will sometimes go rock climbing for a few hours. Does anyone know of other activities that would work for this?</p>

<div class="md"><p>That makes sense. Swimming maybe also?</p>

<div class="md"><p>Swimming is insane exercise. &quot;Better&quot; than the gym. The downside is, you need to learn how to swim first. So it&#39;s pretty restricted to former swimmers, unless you&#39;re interested in learning.</p>

<div class="md"><p>Eh, agree to disagree. It definitely sucks more, but it also gets more exercise in, cardio, slow twitch, long twitch strength. Plus a little mobility.</p>

<p>If you want big muscles, go to the gym. If you want functional strength, swim. My friends who are massive and work out a lot are pretty strong and look big, but have no stamina or range of strength. They&#39;re really good at picking up weights though.</p>

<p>I think it&#39;s all about functionality rather than creating a &quot;show car,&quot; and swimming is better for the former while gym is better for the latter.</p>

<div class="md"><p>Serious swimmers also lift to build strength for their swimming, though.</p>

<div class="md"><p>Yeah for sure. But it&#39;s supplemental.</p>

<p>If everyone swam even 2-3km 4 days a week, and hit gym days the other two, they&#39;d be doing &quot;better&quot; than if they just hit the gym.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t get it. What&#39;s the difference between functional strength and, I guess, non-functional strength?</p>

<div class="md"><p>If you train for a very specific thing, you will get very good at that specific thing. But it doesn&#39;t directly translate to motion outside of that specific motion, though of course it helps.. Doing a bunch of curls and presses is much different from training strength across your functional range. Yes, you can make an insane workout plan that attacks all these different parameters, and then also do cardio later and then also do mobility. But if you know how to swim, you can hop in the pool instead of having to deal with all that. Swiming truly is a brutal experience. Also, lung fitness is great.</p>

<div class="md"><p>And training the very specific thing that is swimming will make you very good at that specific thing.</p>

<p>I didn&#39;t see much carryover between swimming and fitness in other activities.</p>

<p>Swimming has always worked great for helping me get over injuries, though.</p>

<div class="md"><p>What a stupid fucking take. It is completely possible to not have shit tier conditioning like your friends. I don’t even know what the fuck “range of strength “ means. Sounds like some weak person buzzword </p>

<p>I have not been in water above my knees for several years. Doesn’t seem very functional to me. I do however have to lift things up quite frequently so I feel like my strength training has been fairly functional</p>
