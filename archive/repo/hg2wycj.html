<div class="md"><p>It would probably taste bad but its asinine to think it&#39;s dangerous or ineffective like these dingdongs are suggesting.</p>

<div class="md"><p>It is ineffective, google it. Also reflexive inhalation of a powder is never a good thing.</p>

<div class="md"><p>This is the biggest case of majoring in the minors I’ve ever seen. Dry scooping pre is less effective than mixing with water? Are you fucking serious?</p>

<div class="md"><p>You do know water is needed for certain reactions to take place and for efficacy of ingredients right? If you’re dry scooping a pre with a strong nitric oxide complex and glycer pump and Betain anhydrous, you’re doing yourself no favors for intramuscular hydration and vasodilation which is the purpose of those ingredients. But cool you got your little caffeine bump and choked on some powder for your tiktok</p>

<div class="md"><p>Hey, I’m not sure if you know this but you are incredibly stupid and have reading comprehension problems.  I get the irony that you are forced to get this news via reading it but I know of no other way to contact you.  I would seek treatment for this crippling stupidity as quickly as you can, lest it impact your life in a negative way more than it already has.  Good luck!</p>
