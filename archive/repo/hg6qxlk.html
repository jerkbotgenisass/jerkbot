Are face pulls and band pull aparts really necessary if I'm doing rows and reverse flyes?

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Some of the biggest names in fitness make it sound like face pulls and band pull aparts are absolutely necessary. &quot;Non-negotiable&quot; as Jeff Cavalier puts it. My question is why? The benefits of these exercises are clear. They promote muscular balance, shoulder health, and good posture by targeting the rear delts, rhomboids, and rotator cuff. Rows and reverse flyes also directly target these muscles though, so what is it that makes these exercises uniquely beneficial. I realize external rotation isn&#39;t possible with most row variations which is an important part of targeting the rotator cuff, but this is easily done with reverse flyes by using a supinated grip. What am I missing?</p>

<div class="md"><p>It’s hard to take advice from someone who has little, unremarkable, or zero achievements in fitness.  All we know is you admitted you are weak and injury prone, so you may not be the most appropriate person to be giving advice on this subject.</p>

<p>Being strong adds weight to your opinion whether it is right or wrong, being weak does not</p>

<p>In my experience, it&#39;s often the people who are genetically gifted in an arena that give the poorest advice to newbies in that arena who aren&#39;t genetically gifted.  Didn&#39;t we all know that kid in school that had horrible study habits but was just insanely smart and aced the tests anyway?</p>

<p>I wouldn&#39;t trust someone&#39;s advice just because they have success in a given area.  Sometimes it&#39;s in spite of their practices rather than because of them.</p>

<div class="md"><p>That was a pretty tone deaf comment, you don’t accidentally get fit or accidentally get strong. Sure you might reach a beginner milestone slightly quicker but that’s about as far as “genetics” will take you if you aren’t doing the right things</p>
