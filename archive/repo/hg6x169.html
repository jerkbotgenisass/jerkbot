<div class="md"><p>Thanks for the comment.</p>

<p>The brace struggle is real.  Trying to work it out.</p>

<p>My belt is a bit thin too...  I bought a 6.5mm when I didn&#39;t know much.</p>

<div class="md"><p>Yeah you sorta lock in then deep breath into the chest instead of the gut to assist the brace and then push the hips too far forward then squat</p>

<div class="md"><p>I watched your videos, you are a pretty good powerlifter.  Your one(and only?) high bar video is not very good though. You do the same thing he is doing.  You are off your center when you drive(do you think you lost your brace on those pauses? I don&#39;t).  Now I can assume you only have one video on there because your high bar is nowhere near your low bar.  If you wonder why that is, its from not being in the proper low position when you drive.  I would guess when you fail you fail forward right?  Do you front squat?  I&#39;m curious.  I&#39;m not trying to be a dick just something about your advice to him led me to what I suspected and it seems my suspicion was true. If i&#39;m wrong I apologize but like I said you do what he is doing but you are a stronger human so its less blatant.</p>

<div class="md"><p>I squat 550 in sleeves I think I’m doing fine. My high bar isn’t that different from my low bar either. Regardless - the slight valgus is simply a result of the glute moving the femur a tad in there’s hardly any “collapse” the knee is still right over the ankle. </p>

<p>I’m not even sure what you mean by the proper low position and lastly no I fail by simply not moving anymore. There’s a whole lot of guessing and assumptions here based off one video</p>

<div class="md"><p>No i&#39;m not saying you have valgus because I said this dude doesn&#39;t have it either.   I am saying exactly what you told me that your high bar isn&#39;t different from your low bar. That is not how things work.  Powerlifters train high bar to get the benefit of the full range of motion,  why else would you do it?  Specifically your low bar stance does not allow you to get into the proper low position, if you cant get into the proper position the center of gravity is off, that is why you roll the bar down in the low bar so you can tilt your torso and still maintain the center line.  Now if you high bar in low bar stance when you drive from the bottom the weight is going to go forward because the bar is forward as you didn&#39;t compensate changing your stance.  You body compensates by engaging your hips and lower back causing a semi &quot;good morning&quot; lifting of the torso if you watch your pause video you can see your hips shoot you compensate for it.   In the low bar your torso shouldn&#39;t move at all.  See what I mean?  It&#39;s inefficient and at heavy weights dangerous.</p>

<p>This dude is 178lbs and has one of the most perfect high bar squats I&#39;ve ever seen.  Look at his bottom position compared to yours and his bottom knee position compared to yours.   His drive is straight, his bar path is straight.</p>

<p>and do you mean a 555lb high bar?  As why don&#39;t you have it posted?  That is Olympic level at your weight.</p>

<div class="md"><p>My high bar isn’t that different because I used to train it primarily and compete using it.</p>

<p>They train it to get more quad and upper back work not a bigger rom. </p>

<p>Again what do you mean by proper low position? I hit depth so I’m super lost here</p>

<p>You’re comparing my high bar to an Olympic level weightlifter whose practiced it for 10 years do we not see the issue here. He’s also not pausing it and on top of that he’s built very different from me so his proportions will have his squat looking different. </p>

<p>I also don’t really good morning any of my squats.</p>

<p>No I mean a 550 lowbar and that my highbar isn’t that far away maybe 30-40lbs. I don’t post it because I don’t film every single set. </p>

<p>Lastly, this post isn’t about me and yet here you are form critiquing old videos of mine without any credentials to speak of nor me asking. I appreciate the advice - I’ll just ignore it though</p>

<div class="md"><p>Why are you getting defensive?  You can critique people but you cant take it?  You were giving that dude bad advice, I also read your dissertation on training load and fatigue and I don&#39;t know what you are reading in there that is contrary to what I am saying although half the sources don&#39;t work and I can&#39;t get to the studies barbell medicine cites even though a good old ctrl+f showed one whole mention of valgus in their article.   I can give you 100 that explain valgus and why it should be avoided.  Finding exceptions to a rule does not make it the rule there are plenty of things other humans can do that if you did it would injure you.  You are also blanket explaining things. Like the &quot;rounded back deadlift&quot;  dudes that pull like that round their upper back, the arching of the mid/lower back is what most people consider &quot;rounding&quot;.  If you can maintain a neutral spine rounding your upper back great, good for you. 98% of people cant, same with knee valgus, if you have the control of an elite weightlifter valgus at 1Rms isn&#39;t going to hurt you.  I would love to meet one that says they are deliberately doing it though.  Also who taught you to low bar squat a high bar?  What&#39;s the science behind that? What are your credentials?  You are claiming to do two very different exercises the same way, that seriously makes me question you.</p>

<p>Your low position is a low bar squat one.  I don&#39;t know how else to tell you that than to tell you to look at the perfectionist that I showed you because he has been doing it for probably longer than 10 years.  Do you not watch how elite low bar squatters do it as a reference to proper form?  Also I am not talking about depth, if you want to do olympic lifts it does as you have to catch a snatch deep.   I am talking about your torso, hip, and knee position and how it applies to muscle activation and range of motion.  Ideally you should high bar squat as low as possible to take advantage of the lifts ability to have a longer range of motion than the low bar though.  You and this guy are absolutely in a low bar squat position at the bottom. If you want to prove me wrong download an app called iron path and track your bar path. I will gladly apologize. I&#39;m willing to bet you are off center on the drive and you are because of being in the wrong position and having to compensate for it.</p>

<p><a href="https://i0.wp.com/lift-big.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/high-bar-vs-low-bar-squats.jpg">https://i0.wp.com/lift-big.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/high-bar-vs-low-bar-squats.jpg</a></p>

<p>I didn&#39;t say you good morning it I said you semi do it.  If not explain why your hips are doing that and your torso moves. Like I asked you do you think your bracing is breaking down at that weight?</p>

<p>I&#39;m sorry but I do not believe you are high bar squatting over 500.  If I am wrong I will apologize but there is no way you are doing it like you did in that video.  If you are it is brute strength and you are capable of way more with proper technique.</p>

<p>Also I just watched all the current world record holders for the low bar squat and I didn&#39;t see one bit of valgus.  So please point it out to me as idk wtf you are talking about at this point.</p>

<p>Regarding pushing hips forward, I was told once upon a time to do that to stay more upright.  Bad advice?</p>

<div class="md"><p>You’re doing it excessively. Your body will go where it needs to, you’re like over extending the hips where maybe less would be much better if not none</p>
