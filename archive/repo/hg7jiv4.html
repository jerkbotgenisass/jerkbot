<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I am a 48M and about 250lb at 5’9”.  I work out 3-4x/week.  Last month I’ve done my PR in DL and Squat. </p>

<p>I know that BMI does not work for outliers, eg muscular men, in terms of height and weight assessment of fitness. </p>

<p>And I’ve read that 40 inch waist is a higher risk for several diseases related to obesity.  It seems like this is a pretty hard and fast rule medically without exception - at least as far as what I’ve come across online.  </p>

<p>I’ve got a 40 inch waist and, yes, I could lose some pounds.  But I also have a 52 inch chest and when I flex my abs, I can see <em>some</em> definition of the top ab muscle.  This indicates (to me at least) that the fat is not entirely obscuring the muscle like it does in most 40 inch waist cases.  I know I have fat on the sides and in my glutes more prominently.  </p>

<p>I don’t want to be in denial but I don’t want to overwork myself to change something that is just how I am built. It’s discouraging me some TBH. </p>

<p>The below is a recent pic. And yes I’m flexing maybe a little.  Lol. </p>

<p>Anyone dealt w this?  Anyone had a doctor take this into sort of thing into account vice doing the standard BMI = morbidly obese based on height/weight?</p>

<div class="md"><p>Nah I’m saying for 99% of men over 200lbs and sub 6’ tall on Reddit carry substantially more body fat than they believe. Hell I was one of them. </p>

<p>Given that they carry more than ideal level of fat mass reducing that is a good spot to start. Per the article I linked obese BMI due to muscle at an acceptable body fat percentage is highly unlikely in natural lifters.</p>

<p>Edit: Your post indicate you’re strong as hell. Likely in top 0.5% of redditors. You would be an example of outlier with those 350lb rows.</p>

<p>Most people on this sub are beginner to late intermediates. If natty it is highly unlikely they have the mass to be heavier at acceptable body fat percentage.</p>

<p>I think that article is incorrect though and is just making excuses for people and/or the author. I compete in the 93kg/205lb class of a drug tested fed and know tonnes of lifters who are lean and healthy looking at both just a local and national levels.</p>

<p>It&#39;s not that it&#39;s unlikely that natural lifters can be lean and have an obese BMI, it&#39;s that it takes a lot of hard work to get there and this is why it isn&#39;t common. It&#39;s probably physically possible for a large percentage of the adult male population, but it&#39;s just not something that most of them are willing or capable of committing to.</p>

<p>I&#39;m aware that most of this sub won&#39;t fit into this category, but I just want to make it clear that the potential is there if they wish to commit to it. No need to lower the bar by suggesting it&#39;s a near impossibility.</p>

<div class="md"><p>I don’t think it is though. As far as I’m aware, only bodyweight has been consistently linked to lower health outcomes. Hence BMI.</p>

<p>AFAIK the main risk is strain on your heart. I don’t see why that changes if it’s muscle vs fat. </p>

<p>That’s why I would personally be unsurprised.</p>

<p>That&#39;s not accurate at all. Higher muscle mass reduces the risk of injury and disease and increases your metabolic rate making you less likely to store fat. A healthy bodyweight is totally dependent on fat and muscle percentages.</p>

<p>Please find show me any evidence that a high muscle mass is bad for the heart. Most of the strain from high bodyweight is caused by blocked arteries, etc.</p>

<div class="md"><p>What do you mean by “metabolic rate”? If you mean your TDEE, then that also increases with fat mass.</p>

<p>Arteries get blocked at low body weights too. Frequently. </p>

<p>There is an overall correlation between BMI and poor health outcomes that is not traced to any one mechanism. </p>

<p>Im not aware of any evidence that being lean changes this, and I can see a common sense argument that it wouldn’t, so I would be unsurprised if that is eventually found to be not the case.</p>

<div class="md"><p>There is no evidence. When there is, I wouldn’t be surprised if there is no difference in BMI health depending on leanness… but I am repeating myself now and not sure how I can be any clearer.  </p>

<p>A common sense argument? How about 200lbs = 200lbs?</p>

<p>That&#39;s not a common sense argument. 200lb@35% bf isn&#39;t healthy at all and anyone in this state would be suffering from it. Whereas 200lb@12% bf is quite healthy and that shouldn&#39;t take much to understand or accept.</p>

<p>Muscle is healthy. Fact. There is no evidence that you can have too much muscle. There is more than enough evidence that excessive fat is unhealthy. BMI is only an effective measure of health when used on populations because it balances out with individual variation in a large group.</p>
