<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I was trying to be carnivore (just meat, eggs, some salmon). When strict I feel amazing. My cravings for carbs on some days is insane however.  I do some long endurance workouts and hearing several health influencers tout the importance of carbs and not being undernourished makes me think I should consider incorporating carbs. </p>

<p>No problem loosing weight. Putting on muscle has been tough. </p>

<p>Any thoughts on Huel, specifically Huel Black for extra calories?  I dare not post this in the Carnivore reddit.  One health guy I follow says &quot;no sugar, no grains&quot;.  Looks like flaxseed is a grain. </p>
