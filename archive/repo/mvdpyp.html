<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Sorry for another Q but I cannot find anything related to this specific bit of info. I realise you would definitely need muscle meat to have a nutritionally complete diet, but if you were finding eating protein difficult on the system/you didn&#39;t feel like your body wanted any, is it OK to just eat a meal of suet/beef fat for breakfast and then have protein later in another meal. Nothing else. Just 100 or so grams of fat. My body seems to digest it fine and it doesn&#39;t &quot;reject it&quot; so I&#39;m guessing that could well be the answer, but just checking I am not doing something nutritionally dumb.</p>
