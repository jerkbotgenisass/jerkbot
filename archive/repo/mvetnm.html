Am I doing this wrong?

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I am a male 45 y/o, 6&#39; 4&quot; 220lbs. I have a muffin top. Sad thing is as I have been going to the gym for over 3 years. Last year and this year I got serious about working out. I also got stringent with my diet. At this point I am working out 5 days a week with routines developed by two different personal trainers. A good solid weight training regime with daily cardio. I am in a calorie deficit, just over 1000 calories below maintenance.  I track calories, macros, and drink a gallon of water a day. So why is it my weight hasn&#39;t changed at all, and my stomach and love handles aren&#39;t going away? I also take creatine, pre-workout, daily vitamins. Any thoughts?</p>

<div class="md"><p>Are you low carb and maybe you just need liposuction?  (Or self acceptance). I have 2 little
Pockets on my upper thighs that Iâ€™ve had no matter how thin the rest of me is.  Size 4?  Still have them.  The only true way to lose those is surgical.  I know this will prob get me down voted.</p>

<div class="md"><p>Yes I am doing targeted exercises.  I am doing some kind of ab, plank, for my core. And great splits for my upper and lower body. Working muscle groups 2 to 3 times a week.</p>

<div class="md"><p>How long have you been in a deficit? </p>

<p>How are you tracking tour deficit? (Do you use a food scale?)</p>

<p>Do you train with progressive overload?</p>
