<div class="md"><p>It&#39;s just a bulk.  A 500 calorie surplus.  High protein.  Lots of working out.  Maybe a multi vitamin if your diet isn&#39;t super varied. That&#39;s all you need.</p>

<div class="md"><p>500 surplus is a bad idea. You will gain about 1 pound a week while only building 6-8 pounds of muscle (if second year training and good genetics) a year. So that’s about 12,5%-16,7% of your weight gain being muscle. </p>

<p>I would recommend eating in a low surplus of 50-100 kcal to build muscle while gaining minimal amounts of fat. If you think you’re getting too fat, cut down for a bit and just get back on track after.</p>

<div class="md"><p>Bro I guarantee I&#39;m stronger than you, and while I&#39;m not ideal Bodyfat, I&#39;ll hit that in less than 3 months.  </p>

<p>Your advice is what leads to people going to the gym for years and struggling to hit 225 on bench for 1.  </p>

<p>You need to eat.  500 kcal is perfect for making muscle gains with minimal fat gain.  After several months to a year, you cut.  That&#39;s what all body builders do unless they&#39;re elite.</p>

<div class="md"><p>Again, I&#39;ve seen your type.  The pencil in the gym who keeps talking about recomp, who talks about 100 cal surplus.  The guy who repped out 135 on squat a year ago, but is still doing it today.  The guy who barely benched 185 for 1 last year but now a whole year later can do it for 4.  Breaks his back trying to deadlift 315 because he knows he&#39;s weak  and he&#39;s doing ot for his ego. </p>

<p>Ask any big, lean dude.  A guy who&#39;s shredded but not a pencil high schooler shredded, but a man shredded.  They&#39;ll have bulked at 500 cal surplus at some point, and then done a 500 cal deficit.  And they&#39;ll have gained probably more muscle in 6 months than you have in your whole life.</p>

<div class="md"><p>Lol why are you so salty. I have only been training voor 1,5 years and only started tracking macros for about 2 months. I bench 230 pbs and can deadlift 303 lbs for ten reps and 5 sets (only because of lockdown and not having heavier weights). I am 17 and am probably stronger and leaner when you were 17. </p>

<p>Just because you get obese to be strong doesn’t mean other people should be fat to be stronger. Only to cut down and lose their muscle. If you lean bulk you don’t have to crash diet and end up with more muscle</p>

<div class="md"><p>That is absolutely false.  </p>

<p>You are stronger than me when I was 17, I didn&#39;t lift back then, only ran and did calisthenics.  </p>

<p>303 pounds is honestly nothing for deadlift, but you&#39;re 17 so it&#39;s ok.</p>

<p>230 pound bench for one is also nothing, except you&#39;re 17 so it&#39;s ok.</p>

<p>You will never gain anywhere close to what you get from bulking and cutting.</p>

<p>I weigh 210 pounds, at 6&#39;1.  Not only are my lifts much heavier, but I can do more pull ups/dips etc than you.  I can do muscle ups etc.  And all I do is bulk and cut, and in &lt;2 years I hit 275 bench from barely able to do a couple reps with 135.  I&#39;m not shredded, but I&#39;m pretty lean, and I&#39;m in my cut now and will probably lose a little strength, but it&#39;ll come right back when I go into maintenance</p>

<div class="md"><p>230 is more than most people after 1,5 years. also 303 for 5x10 is a lot ,I am confident that I can do 405 with no problem since the only reason I can’t do 11 reps is my cardio. I can do muscle ups too. I also can do a lot of pull ups.</p>

<p>Just because your favorite fake natty says to eat in a 500 kcal surplus doesn’t mean you have too. There are a lot of proffesional bodybuilders like Greg doucette. Maybe learn from them.</p>

<p>You want to gain 1 pound a week while (I think you’ve been training a long time seeing your powerlift numbers) only gaining max 4 pounds of muscle a year. This is a fact I, shared the video with you, go watch it. If you’d rather believe somebody like chef Russ or David laid instead of scientists or kinesiologists, you do you</p>

<div class="md"><p>A recomp is definitely feasible for you. 2,800 calories sounds like way too much though. If you weigh 200lbs, you should be eating about 200g of protein, or 800 calories of protein, a day. There’s no way you need 2,000 calories of fats and carbs a day. Cut down to 2,000 calories a day, get your protein, lift heavy, and do a little cardio at the end of your workouts. If your lifts suffer, eat more. If you don’t lose weight, eat less.</p>

<div class="md"><p>Best bet is to eat a lot of clean food and lift weights. You&#39;re already decently low body fat but you need more muscle to see definition. Train hard and you&#39;ll look better. Losing fat rn will only make you look way too thin</p>

<p>Jk I’d start lifting and doing cardio, I wouldn’t cut I’d try to just eat a fuck ton of protein and cycle carbs hard , you’ll put some muscle on and lean out if consistent</p>

<div class="md"><p>You should probably scale your weight training up or begin weight training, keep the diet at maintenance/enough to have a lot of energy and crush some weights for a couple months and see your frame fill out, then if you desire. Then it’s time to cut but we’re talking 8-12 months time you want to actually build a foundation for the cut. If you desire a skinny slender tiny physique then go cut but if you actually want to look 10% shredded vascular and round and full. You want to build some more lean mass</p>

<p>You likely feel fat because you have a double chin and it is what it is you store fat there if you cut it would likely still be there not as prominent but it would be there.</p>

<div class="md"><p>Agreed. You’re low enough body fat already for now. Time to put on some muscle, and the only efficient way to do that is to accept that you’ll put on a tad bit of fat in the process. You’ll look great after a good lean bulk. Then once you have some more muscle you can feel free to cut if it bothers you. 
But I wouldn’t cut any more right now. Coming from an ex-twiggy guy. </p>
