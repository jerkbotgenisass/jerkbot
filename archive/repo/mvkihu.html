<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I&#39;m two months in. I started for one reason and that was to get my energy back so I can play with my son after work. Before, I&#39;d work all day, come home eat dinner (typicaly full of carbs) and as soon as that started to digest I&#39;d basically be a useless pile crap who couldn&#39;t move from the couch. I can&#39;t live like this I thought. Diets in the past never worked for me because I just couldn&#39;t control my hunger. A buddy of mine who did keto for more than two years, lost a bunch of weight and said to me, &quot;dude, I&#39;m never hungry and I have energy all the time&quot;. I said sign me up. </p>

<p>Keto so far has been like a metabolic cheat code for me. It&#39;s been wonderful and then some. My energy is stable the entire day. I&#39;m rarely hungry and even when I am, it&#39;s easy for me to simply say no to food if I want to go that route. I lost 20 pounds from 205 (my goal weight is 165). I&#39;m more active. Work out every day now. Even my mood is stable through out the day. </p>

<p>First month I started with a typical keto diet - 100g fat, 100g of protein (give or take). Averaging something like 1800 calories a day.  But I&#39;m not patient so when weight loss slows down, I begin to get more aggressive. I started cutting fat down to 60g. And this week Ive been sort of stuck at 185 lbs for three days straight spite taking in about 700 calories those days and working out for two hours each day (lift for 1 hour, light cardio for 30 min then punching bag for 30 mins). This of course pisses me off because.. like how!?! How is my body able to still maintain this weight and It&#39;s got basically no fuel.  During these last few days I feel wonderful spite eating practically nothing (6 oz wild salmon at lunch, 6 oz of chicken at dinner, both baked). What is surprising though is that my muscles have filled a bit and feel larger, and I have noticeably more strength and can lift for longer spite eating under 1000 calories. </p>

<p>So I&#39;m taking it a step further today and fasting for 48 hours to kick me out of this plateau. I&#39;m gonna try out more fasting in the future as well depending how this goes. Just wanted to share and see if anyone had any pointers or suggestions. Any feedback is welcome, even the &quot;you&#39;re dumb for eating that little&quot; and &quot;slow and steady wins the race&quot;, or &quot;your pace is not sustainable&quot;.</p>
