<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>U/darthluiggi  -- M/5&#39;8.5&quot;/50 yrs old. Keto since Aug 2020. KetoGains since Jan 2021. SW 202. CW 147.5. SBF per Dexa 26.5%. CBF per Dexa 16.2%. Goal BF 15%.</p>

<p>Decent weightloss doing strict Keto but AMAZING results doing KetoGains. Best shape of my life. Herniated L3 doing a dead lift 2 weeks ago (stupidly effed up my form and paid the price. Be careful folks).</p>

<p>Question: Since I can&#39;t go near weights for a while and don&#39;t want to lose my momentum..do you suggest a macro mod or any alternate back-safe body weight exercises? Currently doing 1532cal/130-150g protein off days and 1650cal/150-180 prot on training days. So close to my goal and don&#39;t want to lose this new muscle I&#39;ve gained.</p>

<p>Thanks!</p>
