<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Hey guys, I just wanted to see if you all have the same experience as me.</p>

<p>I&#39;ve been training for over 10 years, and my progress these days is pretty slow.</p>

<p>I do my HSPUs on 5 inch blocks and feet on the wall. My max is 8 reps, and I really struggle to get more than this. Last week I only managed 6 reps, as I&#39;ve gained a bit of weight recently.</p>

<p>I often read that we improve by about 1-2% from session to session. So, for instance, if a lifter benches 100kg for 5 reps in a workout, then in the next workout he should just about manage 101kg or 102kg for 5 reps.</p>

<p>Obviously, with bodyweight exercises like the HSPU we can&#39;t really just add 1kg week to week, (unless you have a weighted vest). so we have to increase reps instead.</p>

<p>Now, by my calculations, the difference between 8 reps and 9 reps, is 11.7%. So, adding a rep from week to week is basically impossible.</p>

<p>In this case, should I just focus on increasing the height of the blocks instead, or is there some better way to progress? </p>

<p>Maths isn&#39;t my strong point so let me know if my 11.7% calculation isn&#39;t correct (I haven&#39;t factored bodyweight into it).</p>
