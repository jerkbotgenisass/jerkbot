SR healed my lower back pain

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Guys,
I had a strong urge to post here today.
I have to cut back some of my time to help others that struggle same way I did.
I am 24yo that went cold turkey SR since november 2018 (2.5 year streak now).
When I was 15, my lower back started to hurt dramatically (you know what i started doing at that age..). It would come in waves so basically it would hurt for 2-3 days when it would stop. 
I had SHARP pain that involved both sides of lower back (but mainly left side). 
When i was 20yo, back pain was at all time high and pain started to go through the nerves in LEGS and my butt would be paralyzed for 2-3 days when the pain would hit me. So as I said, it would come in waves.
When I started SR, back pain GRADUALLY got better but very very slowly. 
So lets say when i was off SR pain would come 10 times a year and when i crossed year of SR until now, I had 2 mild cases of pain.
MY body HEALED itself SLOWLY. Notice how i caps MY, because it can be faster for your body.
SR helped me directly and indirectly. 
You know how indirectly? I STOPPED BEING EGOBUILDER and started being BODYBUILDER, even though I started training 7 years ago. My lifts WENT DOWN by 10% on SR. You know why? Cuz I improved my FORM. I dont need to impress anyone anymore.
My body automatically STRAIGHTENED itself I remember on day 60 of SR and from that time my posture was incredible. 
I started SQUEEZING my glutes during the day AUTOMATICALLY, and you know why? 
Because I have the ENERGY to do it. And I LOVE it.
All those things that I mentioned led me here to this moment, enjoying life pain free.
I was PUNISHED because of my PMO behaviour in my teens and now I am getting my power back and I plan on doing this for the rest of my life.
Thats the attitude THAT YOU NEED TO HAVE if you want to succeed with SR. 
This substance is not something you should be playing with. You have LIFE (SON OF MAN) in you. 
I remember when I was 20yo, I was sitting studying and my body got tired basically from SITTING alone. My posture was awful. 
Now, this deep into SR, I can sit 20 hours a day every day with worst posture and I would not have back pain.
Guys, for everyone struggling with lower back pain or every other disease that does not need medical intervention, just try SR, maybe your body will respond faster than mine and you wont need to wait 2 years to see pain disappear. 
Have a nice day you all! üòÉ</p>

<p>Edit: Maybe some of you guys are interested. I dont do fasting. I eat everything I want and whenever I want.</p>

<div class="md"><p>Funny thing is i started getting lower back pains when i started SR. It‚Äôs decreasing over time now. My left leg and thighs used to feel heavy or tight. It‚Äôs like i had weights on them before SR.It‚Äôs gone now. My knees used to be weak and crack alot but it reduced by 50%. Im 6 months into SR for the first time ever. Wish i found out about it way earlier. Late better than never i guess. Good job man. My goal is also 2 years at least.</p>

<p>i fully agree on this as well. its easy to tell who is beating their meat stick everyday draining themselves of their <strong>life essence and spirit</strong>. </p>

<p>they don&#39;t have a decent posture, walk with a tired draggy gait, and always have this <strong>lack of will</strong> in their eyes.</p>

<div class="md"><p>The body has rapid regenerative abilities. If you simply stop the digestive system and seminal production it has an immense amount of energy and so it will heal what needs to be healed. This is why fasting leads to healing.</p>

<div class="md"><p>Yes I did. Before SR, every time I went to dentist I had 1-2 cavities. After 2 years of SR, for the first time in my life I had 0 cavities.

Because people talk about every other benefit frequently but no body has ever talked about improved dental health, nobody in this subreddit has ever talked about dental benefits of SR.</p>

<div class="md"><p>Yes I did. Before SR, every time I went to dentist I had 1-2 cavities. After 2 years of SR, for the first time in my life I had 0 cavities.
