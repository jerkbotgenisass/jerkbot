<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>10 km a week compounded over a year is 1,291 km... Is this really a valid rule of thumb or is this setting beginners up for failure?</p>

<p>For me I feel like 10% a month up to a certain individual amount would be a better rule of thumb. </p>

<p>Say between 20 - 40 km a week. Noting that the level of health benefits between the two isn&#39;t substantial because the amount of activity for 20 km a week roughly meets CDC health guidelines of 75 minutes of cardio activity a week (assuming that running has a 2x factor which would put 75 minutes at 150 minutes). </p>

<p>Also, it seems monthly increases make more sense because it can take a month for bones and tendons to recover from the prior months of training. </p>

<p>It would probably be advisable to add in recovery weeks where you reduce your kms and then build them back up from there just to be even safer.</p>

<p>I feel like longevity outweighs progress when it comes to running because small injuries can set one back an easy month.</p>
