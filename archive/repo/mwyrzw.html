Big older guy - Healthy or not?

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I (48M) have been working out hard for the last few months.  By many of the standard charts (BMI eg), I’m morbidly obese, but I wonder if this is really true that I’m not healthy.  </p>

<p>I’d like to know, but I don’t trust the doctors I see who I don’t think are up on the latest info.  Eg the doctors I’ve gone to seem to default on the weird BMI scale derived from the measurements of 1810 Belgian farmers starving during the napoleonic wars.  As you can see from my snark, I’m not a big fan of BMI as it’s caused me to crash diet many times to stay within the BMI-derived military standards.  (I was out of standards and “fat” as a 17 year old high school football player and swimmer.)</p>

<p>I’m 5’9”, 261 lbs.  if you Google what this typically looks like, the images that come up do not look like me.  I’m not being narcissistic, just stating the truth. </p>

<p>I have a 53.5” chest and 41.5” waist.  17” arms. 29.5” legs at thickest point.  18.5” neck. 17” calves. Deadlift and squat 400# for reps.  Do sprints and burpees often.  Resting heart rate is 65 BPM. </p>

<p>As noted above, my waist is &gt;40” and my online research said this is a red zone regardless of my musculature.  I find this hard to understand as a rule, but I know that visceral fat may be a factor.  </p>

<p>I’m not svelte, but I can vaguely (lol) see ab muscles so they are not completely hidden  by a a large slug of fat several inches thick. </p>

<p>I want to know if I’m “healthy” as is because I’d prefer to stay muscular and at this weight. If I need to, I will try to lose weight.  But as we all know, weight loss is very hard, but especially for me.  I’m not 15% BF or a bodybuilder type by any means.  </p>

<p>I know folks may say, “being muscular doesn’t help you bc your extra muscle puts stress on the heart, so you need to lose weight.”  This line of reasoning never made sense to me.  My retort is, how is my heart weak if I needed to work this very same heart hard to build that muscle?  The heart should be as big/strong or up to the task that built the extra muscle, I’d think.  They should grow together.  </p>

<p>I’m not a Dr. so I’m open to comments on where I may be erring. </p>

<p>Thoughts?</p>
