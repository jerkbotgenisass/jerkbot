<div class="md"><p>Sorry Little Douchette, arnold doesn’t want to follow your garbage fat deficient, fat soluble vitamin deficient diet and destroy his brain with sucralose and aspartame like you have!</p>

<p>Lol at this delusional narcissistic retroactive fake natty piece of shit acting like he knows what’s better for Arnold’s body than Arnold himself.</p>

<p>It’s really just an opportunity to once again shill how overpriced ebook.</p>

<p>Also lol at Closed Caption system not even being able to tell what Douche is saying.</p>

<div class="md"><p>LMAO. I wasn’t sure if he does speech-to-text or if he’s just illiterate and can’t spell. Maybe he does both</p>

<div class="md"><p>I think he does do both, but uses speech-to-text way more often; he says it’s time-saving, because he works those 100+ hour weeks, you know, that writing comments is actually a part of ... nice to see him set such a low standard for the quality of his work for his “job.” No wonder his PDFs are full of mistakes and typos, lol. You can usually tell the difference when he’s typed a comment, but it’s barely more comprehensible when he bothers typing it out/cleaning it up.</p>

<div class="md"><p>lmfao good point. 100 hrs per week and commenting on rando videos and churning out cookbooks with grade school typos</p>

<div class="md"><p>I mean, if he’s going to include watching videos and writing comments in his 100+ hour work weeks, just so he can screech about how much harder he works than YOU MORONS, NOBODY WORKS HARDER THAN HIM, you’d just think he’d do a better job so it reflects well on his work ethic. Like, if my work was low effort and shitty, I’d have to answer for it.</p>

<div class="md"><p>It does seem like more and more people are realizing his bullshit. If Athlean-X can survive the fake weight controversy and Jason Blaha still somehow has an audience despite his years of bullshit, then nothing is really killing Greg. He&#39;ll always have a small cohort willing to overpay for simple shit.</p>

<div class="md"><p>I&#39;m gonna temporally squash our beef for a moment and agree with you here. Greg&#39;s ego has truly popped now, acting like the circle diet can do betyer for arnie. Not like arnie has ever one any trophies or anything aye lol.</p>
