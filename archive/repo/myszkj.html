<div class="md"><p>Keep at it, and you&#39;ll get there.</p>

<p>What helped me was making it a main movement, and adding in some lateral raises. Dips also help, I think.</p>

<p>Also, volume. Just press more. I&#39;m doing upwards of 50-60 reps at lower weight.</p>

<p>And patience. This will take time.</p>

<div class="md"><p>Pressing overhead already puts tons of pressure on the relatively small and delicate shoulder parts, such as the acromioclavicular joint. You get absolutely no added benefit to doing these behind the neck compared to in front, only added risk. Yes, having strong and adequately mobile shoulder will make it less riskier but you are still putting more pressure on your shoulders than needed. And again, for absolutely no added benefit. Ultimately, everyone can make their own decisions, I personally would like to be strict pressing well over my bodyweight for as long as possible, therefore I don’t do any type of movements behind the neck, including things like pull ups as well.</p>

<p>n=1, but holding all other variables constant incorporating BTN presses regularly into my training leads to my shoulders feeling superb. When I drop it, they quickly start to feel worse. </p>

<p>I think most people run into issues with the BTN press because they try and move very similar weights to their normal ohp way too fast.</p>

<div class="md"><p>I&#39;m not sure about that one, <a href="/u/annoynted">u/annoynted</a></p>

<p>If anything, BTN press is more beneficial for overall shoulder health since it emphasizes the side and rear delts better than the classic overhead press. And because you don&#39;t have to bend at the hips in order for the bar to pass your head, possibilities of lower back injuries are also reduced. The thing about &quot;small and delicate&quot; body parts is that we&#39;re trying to, precisely, strengthen them and make them less injury prone. </p>

<p>Also, I don&#39;t get the &quot;more pressure than needed&quot; thing. Like, what we&#39;re after is literally putting pressure on them so that they strengthen in response to the stimulus? </p>

<p>The added benefit thing, I&#39;d say that varies from person to person and the goals they are seeking. Olympic weightlifters, for example, will benefit from behind the neck exercises as they have direct transfer to the snatch and clean&amp;jerk.</p>

<div class="md"><p>If you wanna put pressure on your shoulders, go do narrow dips, add some weight and flare your elbows as much as you can, when you snap one of your rotator cuff muscles, maybe you will understand what I mean by putting more pressure than needed. It’s even worse in BTN press, because you are also putting unnecessary pressure on the passive parts of the shoulder like the AC and glenohumeral joint. And your argument about weighlifting is flawed, plenty of world class weightlifters don’t press behind the neck, so clearly it’s not needed. Plus, comparing lifters like Klokov with their shoulder strength and mobility to your average gym goer is honestly laughable.</p>

<div class="md"><p>It sounds like you&#39;ve wandered your way into a correct belief--that BtN pressing may in fact be a beneficial way to train. Good job, buddy! Of course, that directly contradicts your earlier opinion, but hey, I&#39;m glad you made it here eventually. </p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>AFAIK, there is no actual evidence go support the idea the BtN pressing is inherently more injurious than normal pressing. Perhaps if you have limited ROM in your shoulders then it wouldn&#39;t be a great call, but that&#39;s a very subjective factor, and certainly not one that can be applied to any broad population. Do you have any evidence for the idea that BtN pressing carries &quot;increased risks&quot;?</p>

<div class="md"><p>I can explain, and I have in my first post in this thread. I gave examples with elbow flaring in the bench and dips, since it’s the same principle and most people can visualize it. The difference is that BTN is even worse because it’s also putting unneeded pressure on the passive structures of the shoulder, and the worst part is that you aren’t getting anything you wouldn’t get from a regular press. So what’s next, do I have to explain why you shouldn’t lift with a lumbar flexion in deadlifts or a knee valgus in squats?</p>

<p>Funny you mention those, knee valgus in the squat is demonstrably fine, employed by many very high level squatters, and <a href="https://www.barbellmedicine.com/blog/normal-movements-of-the-low-back-during-squats-and-deadlifts/">we don&#39;t seem to even be able to maintain a neutral spine</a> during effortful deadlifts <em>or</em> squats.</p>

<div class="md"><p>Pressing behind the neck, not pressing in general. If by studied you mean a degree, no and I don’t need one. I have read enough on my own and lifted enough to see that pressing behind the neck isn’t worth it.
Knee valgus and lumbar flexion aren’t fine, of course form will break down under heavy loads. The body is really good at compensating, so it will shift the load in a way that will allow you lift it. And that still doesn’t make it okay, unless you are a professional athlete, then go ahead and sacrifice health for performance. But let’s not pretend this is the audience of this subreddit, lmao.</p>
