<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I do not know what to think about salt. Part of me thinks in a natural world there would be no access to any sodium except through animal meats. Then again, most ZC people cannot get enough of it and require it to feel good. </p>

<p>Today I tried not consuming any table salt. I had loads of raw milk, eggs, fresh beef, sour cream. But towards the end of the day I felt light-headed. I also got dizzy when standing up. I went and bought some realllly salty beef jerky that I love and instantly felt a lot better. </p>

<p>I am just trying to find true health and one thing I can not decide on is salt. Part of me feels it is unnatural, but I can&#39;t deny I felt better after consuming really salty food.</p>

<div class="md"><p>Whoever told you salt is unnatural is a liar. It is mandatory for proper physical and mental functions. Humans have been harvesting salt for thousands of years and even animals have been known to mine for it. Never go salt-free unless you have a desire to self-harm.</p>

<p>Consult a physician or trained dietician if you think you&#39;re consuming <em>too much</em> salt, though, and they can give guidance on a healthy diet that can even be tailored depending on bloodwork.</p>

<div class="md"><p>That&#39;s a little strong.</p>

<p>Traditionally this way of eating didn&#39;t involve adding salt, go read the Bear&#39;s writings. I add salt but to taste.</p>

<div class="md"><p>This. I think it&#39;s worthwhile to deliberately limit salt intake to recalibrate, my intuitive sense is salt can be harmful in excess.</p>

<div class="md"><p>Salt is and has been very easy to get when living near an ocean. Arguably humans evolved near oceans and even now most people live near oceans.</p>

<div class="md"><p>We got sodium from the meat we ate. Animals ate the natural vegetation to get their sodium needs and then we ate the animals. Grass fed beef has a higher sodium content than grain fed.</p>

<div class="md"><p>Animals hunt out salt naturally if the plants they eat don&#39;t have enough. Nothing wrong with humans doing same.</p>

<div class="md"><p>You should read &quot;The Fat of the Land&quot; because this way of eating traditionally was no salt (even during adaptation). The obsession with salt and electrolytes is a keto thing. Will it be mildly unpleasant adapting to no-salt? Yeah. But, it isn&#39;t nearly the life-threatening thing some people make it out to be.</p>
