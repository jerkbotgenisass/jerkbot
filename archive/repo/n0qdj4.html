TIFU by drinking a Gallon of milk in one hour to shove it in Reddit’s face

<div class="post">
<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>It’s still in my post history because I am permanently keeping it as a reminder that I’m a fucking idiot whenever my ego gets out of check. </p>

<p>Okay so this morning I posted on Reddit a conversation me and my friends had in which we all unanimously agreed that drinking a gallon of milk in under an hour is 100% possible and is an incredibly easy challenge. My reasoning was that an entire hour is a lot of time, and that if you just slowly and steadily drink the milk while portioning yourself there’s no reason why anybody can’t do it. One of the lesser challenges was doing a half gallon in an hour and I can say from a certain experience with hot sauce a while ago that I was 100% capable of achieving that so I was absolutely confident I could do two.</p>

<p>I posted it to Reddit, feeling pretty high and mighty of myself on the “unpopular opinions” board and was immediately provided with multiple comments informing me that I was an idiot and had no idea what I was talking about. These comments from inferior humans asked me to record my endeavors and I was without a doubt ready and willing to prove them wrong. So I went to my local 7/11, bought a gallon of 2% and got back to my dorm. </p>

<p>I will give myself credit through my naive ego, I did prepare for the worst a little bit, I sat with a towel bib in case of dribblage and pre-opened one of the shower stalls because the toilets would not account the possible gallons worth milk that could occur from the bovi-licious odyssey I was about to traverse upon. So I turned on my video camera and filled up 5 approximately 25 ounces cups of milk. </p>

<p>Looking at these completely full cups infront of me, the milk carton definitely tricks you with its sheer volume and I was realizing the challenge ahead of me, but mama didn’t raise no bitch so I went in.</p>

<p>First cup: Totally easy, I love milk, my father, brother and I will go through a gallon within 2-3 days tops, and all I have to do is do this every 12 minutes and I’m home free and all those losers on Reddit will know how cool I am.</p>

<p>Second cup: I down this one too, easy peasy, though the first signal to my brain that I was very much so satiated with my daily value of calcium was already upon us. Though this was a challenge even the greatest often failed at, I wasn’t going to underestimate this challenge, but rather like a matador I will corral this bull with steadiness and finesse.</p>

<p>Third cup: this one I was able to not consistently down, I got about half way through and I had to breathe for a second. But I have a 12 minute window to down this so I don’t have to rush it. The camera is still recording, I wonder if I have to post this full hour of footage to prove it or if I can just skip to each time I drink. Ha. Imagine the looks on their faces when they see I can drink an entire gallon. How much time till my next cup? IVE GOT 30 SECONDS?! </p>

<p>Fourth cup: OKAY! I FINISHED THE THIRD CUP IN THE TIME WINDOW! The 12 minute mark hit and I didn’t immediately drink it, I picked it up, inspected it’s beautiful color and temperature, and immediately had to put it back down because a certain noise just befell my ears... did my stomach just... hiccup? Me and humbleness have a very long distance relationship, and as the crazy zodiac girl in my nursing classes has informed me, “you totally DO give off Leo energy”. And while my understanding of stars is lacking I think that translates to at this very moment, I definitely have gotten myself into a bad scenario thanks to my ego”. I begin to drink the fourth cup and my stomach is really starting to slosh around, it’s just stagnant and sitting in there and I can feel it truly filling up. SOMEHOW, BY SHEER MIRACLE OR LUCK, I get cup 4 down within the time window with a few minutes to spare. </p>

<p>Fifth cup: ALL. I. DID. WAS. BURP. A very small burp, but up with it came a mouth full of milk. I realized my fate was sealed. As I swallowed it back down I knew that the second part of the challenge was actually sitting there and not puking as the body begins to naturally break down the lactose and shit in the milk. I haven’t even touched the fifth cup yet, just decided to bring my knees up to my chest to help with the completely full stomach... then, I, very graciously I should add, sprinted like a mad man to the open shower, kneeled on that gross ass floor and prepared for the inevitable. 10 seconds.. 15... nothing was happening... so I slowly got up and went to head back to my room to hopefully finish the challenge, and THEN I BUMPED THE STALL DOOR RIGHT INTO MY GUT. </p>

<p>In that moment I saw two things, the white of the milk projectile ejecting from my mouth into the shower floor from my rapidly turning head as to not destroy everything. And the vision of God punishing me for the next probably 40 years because I attempted to achieve the ways of the golden calf. </p>

<p>It is now 5 hours later, and Reddit has won this time with their stupid facts and basic science that I chose to ignore. I am still making frequent trips to the bathroom with generous supplies of dairy for the toilet from both ends. If you need me I will be listening to “I told you so’s” from the toilet. </p>

<p>Tl;dr: I try to best Reddit by drinking a whole gallon of milk and now my stomach is churning to the point that I may shit butter</p>

<p>Edit: It has been only two hours and so far I have seen many people read this story, understand my overconfidence within it, and then comment that they bet they could personally do the challenge themselves and will be trying soon, which makes me feel better knowing that I am not ill for this world. Thanks guys!</p>

<div class="md"><p>As I recall, MythBusters showed it’s the volume of liquid, not the lactose or anything else in the milk, that makes it a challenge for most people. A gallon of water in one hour would only be somewhat less gross to vomit back up.</p>

<div class="md"><p>Some friends and I did this about 15 years ago for a high school project. My buddy drank a gallon of milk, another guy drank a gallon of chocolate milk to see if flavor had an effect, and I drank a gallon of water as a control.</p>

<p>I made it through my gallon in about 40 minutes...kept it down but had pretty bad chills for a good couple of hours (didn’t know what electrolyte imbalance could do to you back then...).both guys drinking the milk finished in just under an hour, but here’s where it all went bad...</p>

<p>It was plain milk guys birthday, and he had gone out for a lovely shrimp dinner just prior with his family...about 5 minutes post milk, as expected, up came the milk and the shrimp into a 5-gallon bucket. The smell and sight of partially digested shrimp and fermented milk cause chocolate milk guy to lose it into the bucket too. Then, for good measure, I added some very dilute bile water to the mix...End result, half full bucket of the nastiest vomit you’ve ever seen...luckily we have that video laying around in 8mm somewhere (these were the hay days jackass and cky...we filmed everything...)</p>

<p>As I remember, we did get an a on our experimental design!</p>

<div class="md"><p>But then why would people watch it, right? Its the same idea. The shitty shows just phase themselves out, by staying at the bottom of the results.

<div class="md"><p>Why would people watch it? That&#39;s a great question. If you&#39;ve ever seen Jake Paul&#39;s videos, none of them are even slightly funny/entertaining, but the dude is a huge public figure right now. I don&#39;t have an answer to that question, but it&#39;s an interesting thing to think about.</p>

<p>Edit: Now that I think of it, I would imagine a lot of the appeal to Jake Paul comes from younger viewers, as they make up a lot of the YouTube audience these days, and a lot of times their options are either SpongeBob, whatever the modern day equivalent of Drake and Josh is, or Tik Tok/Youtube stars. Obviously that&#39;s an abbreviated list, but you get the idea.</p>

<div class="md"><p>As a freshman in college, I went to someone&#39;s sibling&#39;s high school party, and was the immediate target of a bunch of 16 year-olds in a drinking game. They were kind of fascinated with how fast I could down a full solo cup of beer. After being made to drink several times in succession, full cups, I excused myself and went to the bathroom to vomit.</p>

<p>I made it in and was on target, but will never forget the sensation of blasting out STILL COLD BEER into the toilet. It didn&#39;t even taste bad.</p>

<p>The whole episode took less than 10 minutes. I didn&#39;t even get a buzz for my trouble. And that was the last high school party I ever attended.</p>

<div class="md"><p>I projectile vomited once in our car.  I have chronic migraines and had a particularly nasty one that came with nausea and vomiting.  I kept telling my husband to pull over but he wasn’t understanding what I was trying to say.  I projectile vomited in the front seat of the car.  It went EVERYWHERE.  It was on the dash, the headliner, the seat, my feet, the console and window.  Then we had a 40 minute drive home.  While covered in vomit.  I keep napkins and wipes in the car all the time but this was beyond that kind of help.  The smell.  Oh my gosh, the smell.  My husband was a trooper and never said a word about it.  He cleaned it all up when we got home and I went to hose down in the shower.  About a year or so later my dad was vacuuming my car out and said he found dried chunks of stuff in between the seat and the console.  Husband had missed some.  The poor guy has had to do some bad stuff over the years.  I would say that was right up there with having to insert and remove packing when I had an abscess on my butt.</p>

<div class="md"><p>That’s stupid, they should know how to tell the difference. Dehydration and over-hydration look nothing alike, until late stages when you become confused either way. When dehydrated the mucosal membranes are dry and the skin is slow to return to normal shape when pinched. It’s the opposite when over-hydrated.</p>

She was competing in a radio station’s contest to drink as much water as possible without peeing, with the grand prize being a Wii. </p>

<p>She walked away with 2nd place (concert tickets), and died within a few hours.
The station got sued for wrongful death because they didn’t warn about the dangers of water poisoning, and her family won $16.5 million.</p>

<p>OP was lucky they “only” got sick and threw up, and not finishing the gallon was definitely the right thing to do.</p>

<div class="md"><p>I worked in the oil field for a bit and would often be living in a truck for a few days at a time.  Most of the time was sitting/sleeping waiting to work.  I rarely ate until after the job was done.  One time, after waiting almost 2 days, I&#39;d done nothing but suck back bottles of water.  We started the job and I felt very weak, but trodged through.  I pissed dark yellow and thought, &quot;Damn, I guess I&#39;m dehydrated even though I&#39;ve been drinking plenty of water.&quot;  So I slammed a couple more bottles.  By the time we finished and it was time to drive home, I felt legitimately drunk.  We stopped to grab dinner on the way home and magically I felt 100% better, but still thirsty.  That day I learned how important minerals/salt are to hydration.  Sure, I was drinking plenty, and not excessively, but without any way to hold onto it, I was just pissing it away....literally.  I started munching jerky on long jobs after that.</p>

<div class="md"><p>Is that what happened to me when I decided to detox for an upcoming drug test by drinking a bunch of water quickly? I literally drank close to a gallon while sitting in my car waiting to pick my gf up from school. I got pretty close to finishing the gallon when I had the strongest urge ever to vomit. Being in the parking lot of a college campus, I didn’t want to make a huge gross scene so I went into the school and rushed to the nearest restroom which luckily was a unisex restroom with the wheel chair emblem on the sign. Wasn’t sure if I was allowed to use this restroom but I had no choice. I rushed in, locked the door and just as I reached the toilet, I dragon roared a blast of water into the toilet. No joke my roar echoed in that completely tiled room and surely could be heard outside. Didn’t matter. I was relieved. Learned a very valuable lesson and am happy to say I haven’t failed a drug test since. Kinda gross but my drug free friend’s piss works way better.</p>

<div class="md"><p>I saw a video a long time ago of a guy &quot;training&quot; to eat the most eggs in one go for a world record. He was blending up like 3 dozen eggs and drinking it on on like home video.</p>

<p>Well one day he did it and staggered outside and had a fucking stroke and collapsed. I can&#39;t remember if he died or not, but I seem to remember he did.</p>

<p>Edit: can&#39;t find the video as it is absolutely ancient internet history at this point. But I did find this gem</p>

<div class="md"><p>I’ve completed the gallon of milk within an hour challenge, but I’m also not a “normal” person so there is that lol. For starters I’m 6’3 275lbs so considerably larger than most. I train for power lifting and consume a ridiculous amount of milk.  It’s not uncommon to have 3-4 glasses of milk with breakfast, and the. Protein shakes are always milk never water (I need those calories son!). On bulking cheat days it’s not uncommon for a late night desert to eat a whole thing of pillsbury bake at home cinnamon rolls and kill a half gallon of milk in 20 minutes lol.  </p>

<p>So ya I did the gallon in an hour challenge. It wasn’t super uncomfortable as I did it after a workout when my body was like YAS LIQUIDS AND CALORIES.  While also do to my sheer size, I’m pretty sure me doing the gallon challenge is the half gallon challenge for most.</p>
