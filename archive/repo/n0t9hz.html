<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I just tried out Jess Pryle’s black charcoal dry rub. It’s delicious. And looks great on steaks. </p>

<p>But here’s the issue. </p>

<p>It has sugar. </p>

<p>And after using it twice this week I don’t feel so great. I noticed my allergies are back. And I’m a bit lethargic. </p>

<p>The other ingredients: spices, activated charcoal, sea salt, garlic, and onion are fine with me. I’ve added all of these back in to my diet over the past couple years with no issues. </p>

<p>And since I never have sugar, I’ll say that it has to be the sugar. </p>

<p>Does anyone have any idea how I can make a dry rub with these ingredients and while not including the sugar? </p>

<p>Recipes would be helpful. I’m on a budget and don’t have time to buy all these expensive ingredients and hope I come out with a perfect mixture. Thanks.</p>

<div class="md"><p>I make a simple dry rub using smoked paprika...you can just use paprika, kosher salt, powdered bullion, black pepper, garlic and onion powder and cumin.</p>

<div class="md"><p>This sounds delicious. But I’m trying to just recreate this dry rub I ordered with activated charcoal, garlic, sea salt, spices, and eliminate the sugar.</p>

<div class="md"><p>Well, if the ingredients are listed, you can probably come up with a close mix.</p>

<div class="md"><p>Not sure what the flavor profile of that mix is, but amazingribs.com has a lot of really great recipes for this stuff and you can just leave the sugar out.</p>

<div class="md"><blockquote>

<p>Figuring out what spices they mean is going to be the hard part.  I&#39;m assuming pepper is going to be one of them.  Probably cumin, as that&#39;s often used in dry rubs.  Maybe some coriander and/or paprika - smoked if I had to guess.</p>

<p>After that, it should be a simple matter to put all the other ingredients into the mix in amounts starting at the highest amount at the beginning of the ingredients list and the lowest at the end.</p>

<p>I doubt you&#39;ll ever get it exact.  But with a little work and a decent sense of smell, you should be able to get a close approximation.</p>

<p>Edit:  Doing a quick search, coarse black pepper confirmed, and someone who has eaten it suggests it has a hint of chili, so probably chili powder.  Without having tasted it, I would guess start with equal measures of chili powder, cumin, black pepper and smoked paprika as your spice blend and see if that&#39;s close.</p>
