<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I&#39;m NOT slamming shop-bought meat - it&#39;s absolutely a fine and cheap way to get some meat and fat in you.</p>

<p>Just want to give my own quick experience.</p>

<p>Last time i tried a meat-only diet, i would flush after every meal, no matter if i ate organs, offal, steaks or mince.</p>

<p>This time, i have found a local farm which slaughters and butchers on-site. It&#39;s grass-fed Aberdeen Angus burger patties and grass-fed Lamb patties along with things like grain-free sausages and black pudding, occasional ribeyes etc.</p>

<p>Not had a single episode of flushing since. I&#39;ve also not had the insane bowel movements that i had last time and everything has been fine and normal. My theory for this is that this time i&#39;ve not been adding salt to anything. Salt i know flushes you out (anyone that&#39;s ever been for a colonoscopy and had to drink the salt drink beforehand will attest to this) and i&#39;m wondering if this is why most people get dodgy bowels for the first few months on this WOE.</p>

<p>I&#39;m not sure why but if meat seems to mess you up in any way (exacerbates acne, flushing, GERD etc) then try getting hold of some grass fed stuff and trying it out.</p>

<p>Best thing is it&#39;s not even expensive. £1.10 for a 135g burger patty means if i&#39;m not exercising i&#39;m eating for £4.40 per day.</p>

<div class="md"><p>Good observation. I wonder if has to do with freshness / histamines more than anything. I also understand some people don&#39;t have much choice when starting but then again it&#39;s good to know that often better quality doesn&#39;t necessarily mean more expensive.</p>

<div class="md"><p>Yeah i wonder if it is - although the meat is still hung at my local grass fed place and it&#39;s made from mince too which should up the histamine content, but it&#39;s fine. I&#39;ve just had two and not a drop of red on my cheeks - with shop bought i&#39;m always getting a flushed hot face.</p>

<p>In Lidl it&#39;s like £6.50/kg for crap burgers and the grass fed stuff works out about £7.40. This is however more than twice as expensive as buying the cheapest supermarket mince and making your own.</p>

<div class="md"><p>To be clear, when you say flushing, do you mean your complexion, or do you mean the toilet?</p>

<p>I&#39;ve been mostly-lazy-keto <em>for a while</em>, and as I add more meat, well... <em>how awkward</em>... the post-meal trips.  Well, um, <em>too much gas</em>, and nasty.  <em>It&#39;s not a big selling point so far.</em></p>

<p><em>Thanks in advance.</em></p>
