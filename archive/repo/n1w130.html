<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Hello so I am a 95lb M, 5’0” and recently diagnosed with Lymphoma and need help understanding a good diet regiment and plan.</p>

<p>I was 115lbs and dropped to 88lbs from the cancer in a couple of months. I then got discharged from the hospital and have been on a diet to to gain weight by my doctor.</p>

<p>I ate everything in sight loads of carbs sugars and fatty food and now my meds are messing with my insulin levels and I have to watch my triglycerides...</p>

<p>I gained 6lbs in one week....from 89-95lbs</p>

<p>My doctor recommends me cutting out saturated fat but I read carbs and sugar are the culprit. So here I am looking at the keto diet.</p>

<p>I tried using the keto calculator but it was saying I only needed 1200-1400 calories a day to gain weight. </p>

<p>I was eating 3.5-4k calories and my doctor recommends around 1700 calories</p>

<p>I need to gain weight in a healthy way but also I can’t lift strenuous weight because I have a central picc line tube that connects from bicep to my heart and I cant strain it. So I can only moderately excercise? (Ive just been brisk walking)?</p>

<p>Are these numbers correct? Any advice or suggestions? Doctor said weight gain is more important also since it could cause more complications if I am underweight</p>

<div class="md"><p>So I started keto because of cancer too, and I feel that it helped me kick cancer’s ass (for now anyway!).</p>

<p>I’m not a doctor and I know a lot of well-meaning people will advise you to go talk to your doctor but a lot of the nutritional advice given by the medical profession is not very good in my opinion. I was just told to “do what I want” with my diet. It’s an oversimplification to just say “sugar causes cancer” but it’s true that for a lot of different cancer types, glucose is the main source of fuel. For some cancers cutting glucose supplies means cutting the energy supply for the cancer. Healthy cells can use ketones for fuel whilst a lot of cancer cells can’t (eg breast cancer). However it’s not a magic bullet, some cancer cells like sarcoma and melanoma CAN use ketones for fuel. My suggestion would be to read as much as you can around keto for lymphoma in particular. If you decide you want to go for it then fat is the thing you’ll want to start increasing and make sure to get enough protein too. You can fill up on so-called “healthy fats” like avocados, macadamia nuts etc.. but in my book even the saturated fats that come from meat are not really bad for you.. it’s just the trans fats (margarine and stuff) that you really need to be careful of. I’m happy to talk more if you like.</p>

<div class="md"><p>Thanks for the reply! And yes I was told to do what I want mainly. I get blood tested every week and they just told me to adjust my diet to the results... 
Ill keep reading a bit more and keep healthy fats in mind</p>

<div class="md"><p>To elaborate on the healthy fats comment, what you’ll ideally want to consume the most of are healthy saturated fats- butter, grass fed beef, whole mills, whole cheeses- these are the very foods that our bodies evolved on primarily.</p>

<div class="md"><p>Yes, I feel great when I eat healthy saturated fats , but sooo terrible when loading on the sugar after. I track my food in an app and it always says my saturated fight is too high for the day so it gets me worried. This usually comes from whole cheese (muenster haha) and just meat overall. I cook with extra virgin olive oil instead of butter though. But occasionally splurge. </p>

<p>Is there a difference in saturated fats from a cheese burger and a coconut?</p>

<div class="md"><p>Maybe it depends a bit on what the burger is cooked in - if it’s fried in a seed oil that’s not optimal, would be better fried in olive oil. </p>

<p>Coconuts contain medium chain triglycerides which are said to be healthy. I like my coconut oil in sweet-tasting things.</p>

<div class="md"><p>Focus on Protein and Fats from whole animal sources. Fat of course is incredibly calorie dense at 9 calories per gram and saturated fat is also a valuable source of nutrients. Be sure to eat your leafy greens and cruciferous vegetables too however. You can eat plenty of these on Keto. Just avoid starches and especially grains.</p>

<p>CICO applies to keto despite the contrary being banded about online, so if you eat more calories than you&#39;re burning day to day, then you&#39;ll gain weight. I can testify to this as I experimented with bulking on keto some time ago by consuming 200g+ of fat per day from various sources.</p>

<p>The other good thing about protein and fat is that they create an incredibly low blood sugar response in comparison to carbohydrates, which means your insulin will be under control so long as your carb intake is also kept low. </p>

<p>I&#39;d also avoid consuming industrial vegetable/seed oils or any foods containing them as these are especially toxic to us humans. Cook with butter, ghee, lard, coconut oil, olive oil etc</p>

<p><em>Edit to add</em></p>

<p>A low carb approach could also be an option for you. Just keep your carbs to under 150g per day for this, but more than 60g. This is still way under what mainstream recommendations are for daily carb intake.</p>

<div class="md"><p>This is great info, did your large increase in Fat cause any other issues? 
CICO makes sense. And thanks for the low carb suggestion, didnt think about it. </p>

<p>I’m weighing the benefits of keto and low carb.</p>

<p>It might be easier for me to gain the calories if I can eat like whole wheat toast, and oats for carbs. Is 150g for my size an appropriate amount?</p>

<div class="md"><p>Avoiding seed oils (google “the hateful eight”) is super good advice paired with the whole source saturated fats. Wonderful advice. I’m curious to hear about this experiment you ran. I hover between 100-150 grams a day and for weeks was losing (very small amounts) weight, even at a healthy weight range.</p>

<div class="md"><p>I would recommend consulting with a registered dietitian and physical therapy in your case as they can help you best! 
It will be easier to gain if you are eating carbs and there are ways to eat carbs without sending your bloodsugar skyhigh. Increase your soluble fiber to help with  high triglycerides ( psyllium fiber powder ie metamucil  in water- its gross but whatever). I wish you all  the luck in the world!</p>

<div class="md"><p>Thank you! I talk to my doctor and possibly might talk to a dietician weekly. They usually just say do what I want and base it off my weekly blood test results. Ex: high potassium? Cut out coconut water and bananna. Oh it looks like ur triglycerides are high, cut out saturated fats. Liver enzymes up... etc...</p>

<p>And Ill look into psyllium fiber powder. Usually eating isnt the issue, I have a big appetite. More just balancing correctly</p>

<div class="md"><p>A registered dietitian will be able to look at your medical history and determine a better course of action than people on reddit who don&#39;t have all the info. If for example, you did have blood tests showing high potassium, perhaps from kidney disease, you could further damage your kidneys by eating too much protein. Keto is great but there are reasons to be medically supervised. :)</p>
