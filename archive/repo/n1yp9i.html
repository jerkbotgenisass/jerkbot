Should I be doing deadlifts?
<br/><strong>Posted by <a id="userlink" href="https://www.reddit.com/user/AdMoney8801/">AdMoney8801</a>. </strong><em>Posted at 17:21 UTC on April 30, 2021. 50 Points. </em><em>(self.<a id="selfLink" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/gainit/">gainit</a>)</em><em> (<a id="postpermalink" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/gainit/comments/n1yp9i/should_i_be_doing_deadlifts/">Permalink</a>)</em>
<div class="post">
<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I recently saw in a podcast, there was a power lifter that said that he doesn’t recommend doing deadlifts unless you are actually in competition for them. (I can’t remember where I saw it)</p>

<p>I’ve been doing deadlifts on and off for a while now and to be honest I hate doing them. I really don’t like the way they make my back feel. I’m also fairly confident that my form is fine. (I usually do sumo style)</p>

<p>Some extra info: </p>

<p>I’m a 19 year old male in college. I’m 5’ 7’’ and I weight about 160</p>

<p>Right now I’m lifting to gain muscle, but I don’t want to be massive per say, I just want to find a weekly routine that I can do for the rest of my life. I also lift so I can get better performance and as an athlete. I’m not playing in any organized sports right now, but I love basketball, football, etc. so lifting in order to become a better athlete is definitely a major aspect.</p>

<div class="md"><p>Just as a side note: if you listen to every expert, you&#39;ll eventually get contradictory information on literally everything. You need to listen carefully to their arguments to understand why they&#39;ve come to their conclusions, and then draw your own conclusions based on your greater understanding of the issue.</p>

<p>Oberst discourages deadlifts because of the potential for injury. Sure, you could cut deadlifts out of your workout. But you could also reduce your risk of injury if you improve your form, refrain from going overboard, and treat it like a potentially dangerous lift rather than a chance to show off. Be smart about how you listen to expert advice, and you&#39;ll find a way that serves you.</p>

<p>I also want to add, oberst is not an expert. He is a top level athlete and offers his own coaching services, but he lacks any educational background on training so his opinions should only be taken as a thought and not a truth.</p>

<div class="md"><p>The SSB is good, it&#39;s why I included it, but if you limit me so much, my biggest priority will always be weight overhead first because I find that&#39;s the biggest builder of strength and physique.  After that, conditioning is a must, and the prowler is the ultimate in general conditioning AND it builds legs with no eccentric so you can just do it forever.  After that, stones build full body everything and will take care of anything that got missed by the press and prowler.  With room left over, I figured some sorta squat would be good, and picked SSB because you can brute force it and it saves the shoulders for pressing, and then chins are just always worth doing.  Moving your body through space is invaluable, and they&#39;re a good measure on if you got too fat, haha.</p>

<div class="md"><p>It was actually my worst contest ever, haha. I almost quit the sport.  But both of those dudes were awesome. Also had Martins Licis as a guest judge and Kaz as an announcer in 2 competitions. It&#39;s been a good time in the sport.</p>

<div class="md"><p>Nice to hear that from you, in the light of my recent decision to stop doing DLs, and use the &quot;vacant room&quot; to increase volume of my squats and legs exercises in general.</p>

<p>I have always loved DLs, it is the lift where I can lift the most and makes me feel macho, but the truth is it affects my recovery, and it does not seem to contribute to my goals (aesthetics) as much. </p>

<p>Squats? I can feel the work in my legs and ass. Presses? Chest, shoulders, tri pump. Pulls - my back and biceps. DLs? Nothing. So I think it is time to see if I can do something about my chicken legs. And squats rarely make my lower back feel funky.</p>

<div class="md"><p>If an exercise bothers you, there is no rule saying you must include it. Especially if you&#39;re fairly certain your form is on point. Of course you could try to modify the lift by shortening the range of motion via a rack, blocks, or saw horses. If you nix the DL altogether, that&#39;s fine, but plug another hip hinge movement in its place. A banded good morning, a pull through, a kettlebell swing, etc. Just don&#39;t neglect that movement pattern if possible.</p>

<div class="md"><p>If I recall he said that in the context of how they didn&#39;t do deadlift for football and the risk/reward of the movement for an NFL athlete.  An NFL player with a multimillion dollar contract has a lot more to think about with regards to risk vs rewards than your average lifter trying to get a bit stronger.  </p>

<p>Deadlift is still a movement pattern that I think everybody should have some strength in. Maybe your average joe once he reaches 4 plates or 5 plates or whatever might weigh the risks/rewards (if any) of going higher and higher.</p>

<div class="md"><p>I do a Romanian deadlift. It is not the same, but i feel is enough for me. I use less weight and it is more controlled on the way down and up.<br/>
For me i feel it is a less risky move.</p>

<div class="md"><p>I really like RDLs and do them as well, but they’re in no a way a substitute for conventional deadlifts. RDLs work the hamstrings very heavily, which is awesome, but they don’t do all that much for your lower back in my experience. I incorporate both in my routine, usually doing DLs exclusively as a main lift on back day and doing RDLs after squats on leg day.</p>

<div class="md"><p>Same. No more deadlift for me bc of back, but RDLs are just awesome.</p>

<p>However they clearly do not work the same muscles</p>

<div class="md"><p>What are you talking about? Conventional deadlifts and RDLs both work the hamstrings and glutes and erectors.</p>

<div class="md"><p>The main differences between deadlifts and RDLs are the latter don&#39;t involve the quads, they start at the top and have a possibly shorter ROM, depending on the lifter&#39;s hamstrings. They&#39;re basically top-down SLDLs.</p>
