<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I&#39;m looking to gain weight and I find it hard to work up much of an appetite. I want to gain weight on keto, and I&#39;m not sure how. I also have a few questions </p>

<p>Will gaining weight on keto be healthy?</p>

<p>Will gaining weight on this diet kick me out of ketosis?</p>

<p>How many calories should I eat? (5&#39;11, 140, 21 year old Male) </p>

<p>I&#39;m feeling nauseous and I have hardly any energy. My heart rate is also high since going on this diet. I understand this is the &quot;keto flu&quot; and I&#39;d like to move past it as fast as I can. Also, what shakes do some of you veteran keto bulkers reccomend? </p>

<p>Thank you for the responses in advance and I hope to see some good advice</p>
