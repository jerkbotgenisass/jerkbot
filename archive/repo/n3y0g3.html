<div class="md"><p>Would being lighter at 5’11 not be an advantage given height/length?</p>

<p>In terms of your question, you’ll need to eat at a surplus. 3500 calories equals 1 lb. If doing low carb, you’re liking supplementing 3-4 1,000 calorie meals with 2-3 no-low carb protein shakes. </p>

<p>Depending on your timeline, this can be very difficult to achieve going low carb. If not for health reasons, I’d consider going at least moderate carbs to get there more efficiently and than transitioning back to keto as you get closer.</p>

<div class="md"><p>I get chicken thighs for around 2.15/lb. Wack em in a pan with butter to get some color. Then in bulk into the oven. Use leftover butter/chicken grease in pan to cook something like cauliflower or zucchini/squash. Works for me for lunches at work.</p>
