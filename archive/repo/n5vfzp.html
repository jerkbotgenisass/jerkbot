1 Year Recomp Results (72kg -> 71 kg)

<p>Information about me: 23, Male, 5&#39;11&quot; (180cm), 158 Lbs -&gt; 155 Lbs</p>

<p>I was running Coolcicada&#39;s PPL split for 5-6 days a week for majority of this time, while running occasionally. I got bored and physically run down from going to the gym so often. Now I run Stronglifts 5x5 3-4 days a week but instead of 5 reps I do 12. So Stronglifts 5x12. Every other day I also run 10km. </p>

<p>Pretty happy with the results but I do wonder if it was time effective but I did go from completely untrained, never lifting or doing any physical activity to working out religiously. </p>

<p>If I could go back and change something, it would be my attitude. I felt like I was in a rush to get fit, pushed myself really hard and lifted more than I probably should. I got injured a few times, and it sucked not being able to work out. I fucked my back big time from lifting way too heavy for too long, couldn&#39;t get out of bed without being in pain... </p>

<p>Which is why I&#39;ve opted for less days in the gym and more volume. I&#39;ve dropped all my weights and instead am focusing on doing 12 reps for 5 sets. Yes, each session can be as long as 2 hours but I really love it. </p>

<p>My diet has always remained the same. Now though I eat a bit more and a bit cleaner. I don&#39;t eat from 5am-2pm. </p>

<p>Lifts. When I started I was obsessed with just lifting as heavy as possible. I was ashamed of lifting light. Now I&#39;m happy with my lifts and I&#39;m gaining and get a decent pump. </p>

<p>Recent lifts. </p>

<p>Bench: 60kg x10</p>

<p>OHP: 30kg x12</p>

<p>Squat: 60kg x12</p>

<p>Lat Pulldown: 50kg x12</p>

<div class="md"><p>Yes. I feel as if that I could&#39;ve gained more if I ate at a surplus though</p>
