2 weeks in, still only able to eat a small amount of meat per day

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>And I&#39;m definitely feeling weak as a result. I&#39;ve heard people say that after awhile their body starts really craving meat but right now I can only get maybe 1/2 a pound to a pound a day in me before my body just outright rejects it (tastes terrible and I get nauseated if I try to continue eating). How long should I expect this to continue? I&#39;m eating mostly high-fat beef, occasionally adding in cheese, heavy cream, butter.</p>

<div class="md"><p>Perhaps try different cuts, animals, or sources? Try leaner cuts of beef or try pork, lamb, or even chicken. Try grass-fed, etc. You might just need to experiment.</p>

<div class="md"><p>you may be reaching your protein satiety before complete satiety or you may not be eating the types your body prefers.</p>

<p>some questions, high fat beef --- what&#39;s high fat about it? are they really marbled ribeyes that haven&#39;t been trimmed? are you eating burgers?</p>

<p>you could add mores butter if the meat you have is too lean.</p>

<p>but try to get to the store to buy a wider range -- fatty lamb, ribs, beef, sausages. Get one or two size meal portions in order to test which ones you want to eat again.</p>

<p>adding: took me a couple of weeks, the first week I was where you are at now, so that was when I went out and started to search for variety.</p>

<div class="md"><p>I&#39;m trying with variety though more 80/20 beef since I don&#39;t have an unlimited budget, but also some fatty NY strips, pork shoulder, etc, eating all the fat with them as well as adding butter and cream usually. I&#39;m having just as much trouble getting myself to eat fat as I am protein.</p>

<div class="md"><p>hmmm .... i really hated at the beginning, but i pushed through it because i was doing it for health reasons. </p>

<p>are you doing this for health reasons or because you&#39;ve done LCHF and it wasn&#39;t effective for you?</p>

<div class="md"><p>How long did it take you to get to a point where you didn’t hate it or even enjoyed it?   I’m day 4 and I’m a little tired of it.  I’m mostly beef with other meats/eggs for side dish.</p>

<div class="md"><p>The first month is weird. It&#39;s not like that for everyone, but it was for me. It got progressively better but things were off for a couple weeks. Appetite went up and down and was non-existent at times. Try to vary what you eat until things adjust.</p>

<div class="md"><p>For me I get nauseous when I eat too much fat. Maybe eat some leaner cuts?</p>

<p>Also if you have a dehydrator and can make jerky, I would do that. I can just snack on jerky all day. (make it without marinating ofc)</p>
