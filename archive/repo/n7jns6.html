<div class="md"><p>Ngl, watching most people do good mornings rounding their back is pretty painful to watch.  Low lumbar spine injury can come at you fast.  Squatting (even in the hack squat machine ) you see a lot of people hinging at the knees and the weight is too far forward.  That&#39;s one of those injuries that just creeps up on you.  Watching lots of tricep work (french press, skullcrushers) you&#39;ll see a lot of flared elbows which is murder on those elbow tendons long term but you can put up much more weight that way.  </p>

<p>You just kind of ignore it and go about your workout because no one wants to hear it.  Earbuds in and jam on.  You can look like a dick with knee sleeves and elbow sleeves but they&#39;re great for chronic injury prevention.</p>

<div class="md"><p>There are plenty of articles on this topic, some also cite studies, just look for yourself: <a href="https://www.google.com/search?client=firefox-b-d&amp;q=leg+extension+problems">https://www.google.com/search?client=firefox-b-d&amp;q=leg+extension+problems</a></p>

<p>If your doctor recommended this machine for you specifically then continue to use it. It does have its benefits if the muscle it trains is exactly your problem area. But you should switch to squats or leg press once the problem is solved - that&#39;s why I&#39;ve written it is bad &quot;for long term use&quot;.</p>

<div class="md"><p>I would like to point out, this is a good work out tip. High reps at low weight is very good and unless you really want to build muscle mass, you should be doing that. Low reps at high weight are good for building muscle. If that&#39;s your workout, you should only be doing 8-12 reps, before you physically can&#39;t anymore.</p>

<p>Also, since people are apparently listening to me, I want to reiterate I am no expert. I&#39;m simply giving you the information given to me by trainers, experts in anatomy and amateur body builders. If you&#39;re at the gym, and one of the employees comes and gives you advice, take it. They&#39;re the ones that know how things work, way more than I do</p>

<div class="md"><p>It&#39;s OK, I&#39;m a Physical Therapist with a PHD in biomechanics and have published multiple papers on strength and conditioning.</p>

<p>You&#39;re correct. 5x5 and pyramid style workouts where you increase the weight and drop it down for your last 2 sets works wonders for Type 2a and 2b fibre recruitment because of the impact they have on both glycolytic and oxidative metabolic processes.</p>

<p>In other words, you&#39;re recruiting all of your muscle and not just parts of it. If you want bulk, you need full recruitment of all fibre types. Your reps, sets, load, velocity, range, and rest time are all factors in how to achieve that.</p>

<div class="md"><p>At that point it&#39;s just a matter of cardio. Aim for 70-80% of heart rate max for a minimum of 20 minutes. Best way to do that is continuous, but if you want to tone up with it, doing small weights with supersets or circuits are your friend. The key is to not recover your heart rate and start over. Gotta be continuous fatigue. You won&#39;t cut much if you&#39;re gassed for 30 seconds, then recover for 2 minutes, and repeat. Your heart rate should never fall below 70% of your heart rate max. Or roughly 220-age. So probably around the 125-130 range.</p>

<p>When I&#39;m on cardio and cut phases, I do 90 minutes at 80% of heart rate max. But that&#39;s with training. 20 minutes should be your minimum aim, otherwise your body won&#39;t be oxidizing fat.</p>

<p>Good luck!</p>

<div class="md"><p>Look into HIIT, which is often better than steady state cardio for cutting.  It&#39;s still like 30 seconds of work and 15 seconds of rest, so it&#39;s more work than recovery for sure, but steady cardio for extended durations isn&#39;t necessarily better for cutting.</p>

<div class="md"><p>Well it depends. Muscle strength is high weight. That is where you do as many reps as you can, with a weight around 75% of what you can lift once and once only (1 rep max or 1RM). This doesn&#39;t necessarily make your muscles bigger, but stronger.
Muscle endurance is when you use smaller weights. 20 or more reps each set with something about half of your 1RM. You do this to increase your muscles oxygen uptake.
Muscle size is the midpoint, where you lift something about 60% of your 1RM, 8-12 times. If you can&#39;t reach 8, you&#39;re at too high of a weight, and if you can get above 12, you&#39;re using too light of a weight.
If you&#39;re just trying to lose weight, cardio is very important, but weightlifting also seems to be useful. In that situation, all of them seem to have the same effect, so shake it up, and then when you&#39;ve reached your ideal  body type (not weight because you might be gaining muscle, which is heavier than fat), switch the technique to do whatever it is you decide is right for you.</p>

<div class="md"><p>I used to manage a bunch of fitness clubs, and I completely agree with what <a href="/u/Frenchymemez">/u/Frenchymemez</a> said, and would also like to add that a healthy diet and rest is also necessary along with the exercise</p>

<p>Ideally you want to have 6 small meals a day, around 3 hrs apart, with a strict healthy diet for 6 days and 1 cheat day where you can eat anything you want. That helps the body understand that there is always enough food coming in, and on a set time, and the cheat day helps you maintain the lifestyle change (always think of it as a lifestyle change instead of a diet, easier to maintain it that way). More protein to gain weight, more carbs to lose weight, keep healthy fats moderate (not too low or high). </p>

<p>And you want to push to muscle failure, not muscle injury and allow enough rest in between to recover. And drink lots of water! Hope that helped</p>

<div class="md"><p>You can use weights or do a body weight workout if you&#39;re just starting out. The most important thing is that you find a program that works for you, you are consistent in doing it, and it covers your major muscle groups. There is a lot of talk about what is &#39;optimal&#39; out there for muscle, strength, etc. (3x12? 4x6?), but the routine that works for your life and you can get yourself to do on a regular schedule is going to crush any kind of optimization every time.</p>

<p>Having said all that, I think three sets of 8-12 repetitions per lift is a good starting point for most people. If going a little lighter with more reps works better for you, try 10-15 reps per set. Again, building the habit of working out regularly with consistent movements that you can keep improving on is going to be the biggest thing! Don&#39;t get bogged down in the strength/hypertrophy/whatever debates.</p>

<div class="md"><p>So it helps. That&#39;s the important thing. I&#39;m not going to the gym in order to be the biggest man there. I just want to cut, so helping with some tone is great. And maybe that is the case, but I&#39;ve never heard anyone say that. Like I said, my lecturer, who is an expert in anatomy, and is going to the gym to lose his dad bod, told us all the importance of low weight high rep while talking about blood flow in the body. Trainers have told me that while I&#39;m new, to keep low with weight and work on reps, before slowly increasing. I am not an expert, so I could definitely be wrong about it, but I&#39;m using information given to me by people who do know what they&#39;re talking about.</p>

<div class="md"><p>Your trainers are telling you to stay low because you&#39;re new and your form isn&#39;t adequate yet. If you go high with bad form, you&#39;re going to hurt yourself. It has nothing to do with benefits. This is exactly what I do as well, when people ask me to help them.</p>

<p>You get blood flow with high weight low rep followed by high rep low weight. Your lecturer is referring to the &quot;pump&quot; which is very difficult to get when you&#39;re only doing high rep low weight. You can&#39;t get it unless you exhaust your muscles to their breaking point. Then you do high rep.</p>

<p>I&#39;m not trying to be combative, but I am trying to shed some light on things you might not know. Good luck at the gym.</p>

<div class="md"><p>Actually, I am not new. I used to go to the gym regularly. I used to be very well defined. I had an accident which hospitalised me. I lost a ton of weight, and gained it back when I got out. And then gained more. I was lazy and didn&#39;t do anything to lose weight, and restarted the gym recently. My form is fine. They said &quot;start with lower weights and do more reps, until you&#39;re exhausted. Keep doing that. Eventually, you&#39;ll be able to up the weight and work on lower reps if that&#39;s what you want&quot;. Perhaps you do need to exhaust them before gaining the benefits for endurance, but that&#39;s not what I&#39;ve been told. I am also not trying to be combative. I&#39;ve said I&#39;m not an expert. I&#39;m just giving the information I&#39;ve been given to other people. The information that worked for me, and others I know. Low weight high rep has worked for plenty of people I know. You&#39;re the first I&#39;ve met who has said its a myth is all man. Thank you for wishing me luck. Have a good day, and stay safe :)</p>

<div class="md"><p>Dude, listen to people who know what they’re talking about. If you’re trying to get “cut” doing low weight, high reps is a complete waste of your time. I promise anyone who’s told you otherwise is a complete moron. </p>

<p>Getting “cut”, gaining muscle, while losing fat, is all about caloric deficit, proper protein intake, and PUSHING YOUR MUSCLES. You’re not building any muscle with low weigh, high rep. </p>

<p>Though obviously you can use low weight as a warmup. That shouldn’t be your main workout, if you want to get cut.</p>

<div class="md"><p>I am gaining muscle mass. Just not huge amounts. I&#39;m already quite a muscular person. I have good genes. But I have a lot of fat over the top, so my goal while cutting is to lose that fat, while gaining a small amount of weight so I can stay happy with my body. If I lose some muscle mass, I kind of don&#39;t care. Again, I&#39;m not trying to be super muscular. Just less fat.</p>

<div class="md"><p>“Building muscle during a cut” is an oxymoron. We build the muscle prior to the cut, then work to maintain that muscle during the cut. Not build. This is how competitive body builders prepare for competition or when a “real” body builder said “I’m cutting” .. that’s what they mean. </p>

<p>Cutting now, it seems, has become a common word that people use when they just want to lose fat. It’s much more than that.</p>

<div class="md"><p>That is not true. You can absolutely build muscle during a cut. It’s just pure science; you lift heavy and eat protein, your muscles will get bigger. Unless you’re eating nearly no calories. You won’t see as much gains as bulking, but your muscles 100% get larger. </p>

<p>What you’re saying is basically, “you can’t build muscle on a caloric deficit(cut)”, which isn’t true.</p>

<div class="md"><p>I never said you can’t. I said the purpose of a cut, a <em>real</em> cut, is not to. We want to maintain our muscle mass during the cut, not build more. Yes it’s possible, but it’s not the goal.</p>

<p>And yes, you can build muscle with a deficit. I agree completely. So long as you have fat stores to pull from, you’ll most likely gain muscle.</p>

<div class="md"><p>I haven&#39;t done this in a long time but one thing i dont like about bodybuilding training is how hard it is to keep track of progress for all these different exercises. For example on one machine i did 42.5kg for 3 sets of 12. I&#39;ll write it down so that next week ill try to go harder by either doing more reps or adding weight and do that for every exercise. Too many people go by feel which is fine at first but it doesn&#39;t work in the long term. I personally made serious progress doing this for a couple months then covid hit and i lost all of it.</p>

<div class="md"><p>&lt;serious&gt; You should start any workout program with high reps, low weights, and work through to lower reps, higher weights. Periodization is a critical part of adaptation. Broadly speaking, each phase of a workout plan should be 6-8 weeks, and then changed. Also, the <em>way</em> you lift is every bit as important as how many and how much, and not just to avoid injury; if you&#39;re benching, you&#39;ll get the best results by going up on a two-count, pause, and down on a three count. You&#39;re doing more work on the elongation phase than the contraction phase.</p>

<div class="md"><p>I’m a body builder and I support this comment. </p>

<p>Also, touching on form and proper form.. using proper form will not only save you from injury, but it’ll build muscle faster. It also make shows you how strong a muscle group really is. I see tons of guys doing basic barbell curls, curling 70-90lbs, but they’re using their entire body to curl it. Throwing their momentum back, pushing with their legs, using their shoulders.. all to do a barbell curl. </p>

<p>Do it properly, elbow tights, no movement aside from the arms, and you’ll be humbled very quickly. Those guys throwing back 90lbs struggle after a few reps at 30-50lbs once proper form is introduced. They also will now build biceps faster by actually focusing on them.</p>

<div class="md"><p>Yes for average strength building, but no for 1 rep max building. Muscles respond relatively the same with both methods, but it’s to do with the nervous system not being tuned to send the extra strong electrical signals needed to lift very heavy weights.

<p>The benefit comes in the particular muscle fibers you have, genetically. Fast or slow twitch fibers, but overall in a several controlled studies it was shown that both methods of lifting produced similar enough results to be negligible.</p>
