<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>im 16,172cm,76kg I think alot of my weight are bone mass as im not very ‚Äúfat‚Äù but before covid i was 66+. Backstory, when I was 14/15 i was quite lean. I ate alot and exercised (sports) every time i can when people played games i went to exercise. Now i think i have grown older and my metabolism rate isnt as high and i should start working out and dieting. I think I have moderate amount of mass but alot is covered by my weight. What should I do?Im a complete noob here. Also I need tips for vegetables I absolutely hate them. Out of curiosity tho do you guys eat vegggies for your health or you guys think it tastes good? gym is currently closed so would prefer body weight workouts but i think it would open soon. My thighs and calfs are fairly big but my thighs are not that muscular just big. I also have gained alot of stubborn fat from binge eating. I think my goals rightnow are to lose weight and stubborn belly fat first then proceed to gain muscle. Thanks guys complete noob here dont bash me üòÖ</p>

<div class="md"><p>There is an app called thenX which you can select workouts for bodyweight which specialize in certain case or certain part of your body </p>

<p>As for veggies like carrots , broccoli , lettuce , etc taste quite good so its ok but i absolutely hate peas so i avoid them</p>
