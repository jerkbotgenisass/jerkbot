<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>15, male, 6”, 69% ectomorph  and 31% mesomorph, 73 kg</p>

<p>My BF% is probably 15-19% I don’t really know and I have average muscle mass but I look slightly skinny fat. I want to get an attractively shaped physique (wide shoulders, narrow waist) and lower bf/increase muscle.</p>

<p>What body weight exercises should I do and how many reps and sets to get that muscular, v tape, giga chad physique?</p>

<p>I plan to enroll for gym when I’m 16 so what do you recommend I do to prepare for gym as well as what exercise should I start off with when starting at the gym?</p>

<div class="md"><p>&gt; 69% ectomorph and 31% mesomorph  </p>

<p>Ditch this thing. It&#39;s subject to debate on academic settings and not something you should be worried about. Your body is your body and might be a combination of ectomorph, mesomorph and endomorph to such a point where these notions stop making any sense.  </p>

<p>&gt;  My BF% is probably 15-19%  </p>

<p>Unless it&#39;s been measured by a professional, any guess is just a guess. Be concerned on how your body will evolve as you start exercising and dieting, not on the numbers.  </p>

<p>&gt; What body weight exercises should I do and how many reps and sets to get that muscular, v tape, giga chad physique?  </p>

<p>You can start by looking up the Recommended Routine on this subreddit. It will set you on the right track to build muscle, lose fat and become healthier. Do note, however, that if your aim is to become &quot;giga chad&quot;, after some point it becomes really hard to build mass with calisthenics only. You might want to resort to weighted calisthenics or weight training. What point is this? Depends on you actually.  </p>

<p>Anyway, be patient. Building muscles takes years of consistent work, consistent eating and consistent sleep and rest.</p>

<div class="md"><p>Agree with the other guy, start off with the RR in this subs wiki. Puberty is natures steroid cycle so make the most of it! Make sure you’re eating lots of good food so that you’re gaining weight. Don’t be discouraged if you don’t see results immediately - they will come!</p>

<div class="md"><p>Pushups, pull ups, rows, dips, pike pushups, squats.</p>

<p>Follow the same principles as everyone else, it doesn&#39;t really matter much in regards what exercises to do if you&#39;re 15 or 60, man or woman, skinny or fat.</p>
