What is the biological cause of water retention plateaus during extended weight loss?

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Hey guys, I already know about glycogen reserves causing +-5 fluctuations of water weight when switching from an anabolic surplus to catabolic deficit. But what about this common experience?</p>

<p>You&#39;re tracking calories to a 500 deficit, and you steadily lose 1 lb/week. But then your weight loss stalls. For 15~ days, your weight hovers around the same number, going up half a pound, down half a pound. No progress. You wonder, do I need to adjust my intake again?</p>

<p>On the sixteenth day, you lose three pounds.</p>

<p>What is going on in your body that causes this?</p>

<div class="md"><p>If you&#39;re a women, your mentrual cycle will influence water weight and potenitally mask fat loss.  I&#39;m not going to pretend to understand the processes involved; I&#39;m happy enough leaving the biological cause at &quot;hormones&quot;.   </p>

<p>Beyond that, Lyle has a couple of write ups examining this effect:</p>

<div class="md"><p>I had a really weird experience last week. Had dropped a few hundred grams a day consistently. Then one day I had dropped 2kg! From one to the next. Tried weighing myself again only to get the same result. </p>

<p>Following day I was back to were I should though. But I do believe the drop that day was horomones coupled with salt imbalance. Had changed up my diet and hadn’t gotten enough of it and felt really bad for a day as it took me a few hours to realise - and then some for the body to catch on to adjusting in.</p>

<div class="md"><p>Thank you for those interesting links!</p>

<blockquote>
<p>So beyond the above explanations, what’s really going on?   I suspect that at least some of it is related to the hormone leptin and all of the effects it has on bodyweight regulation.  As I’ve discussed in various books as well as when discussing the full diet break, leptin levels increase fairly rapidly when carbohydrates are increased.  Even 5 hours of over-feeding carbs can raise leptin.</p>

<p>With even a few days of eating more calories/carbs, leptin will go up.  And while many of the effects of leptin aren’t immediate (which is part of why I recommend 10-14 days for a full diet break), some of them might be.  Leptin is part of what regulates cortisol levels for example (leptin inhibits cortisol release) so at the very least, increasing leptin would help to reduce water retention.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>That would suggest that people doing carbohydrate-heavy diets might see more erratic, &quot;staircase pattern&quot; weight loss. I wonder if Lyle is onto something here.</p>

<p>Still... seems like it&#39;s still just speculation. That&#39;s disappointing.</p>

<div class="md"><p>This is probably the best answer in this thread. Ultimately, it&#39;s some type of fluid status change with a swing of more than 3lbs in a day. What&#39;s the cause, it&#39;s hard to know without going through every single variable.</p>

<div class="md"><p>LOL, and it&#39;s even dependent on your blood pressure today versus where it was yesterday/last week/last month, in other words how sensitive your RAAS system is and how dilated your afferent and efferent arteriole for the glomerulus is. I mean seriously the human body is stupidly complex and to boil it down to a single variable misses the forest for the trees.</p>

<div class="md"><p>I think your water weight fluctuates the same amount when you are maintaining weight vs. losing weight. It just *looks* like a plateau when you&#39;re losing weight (since your actual weight is decreasing while your water weight increasing, for example). To illustrate this - if you draw a zigzag line on a downward slope, it&#39;s going to look like a series of plateaus and drops, whereas if you draw a zigzag line on a flat line it&#39;s going to look like a series of ups and downs. But in both cases the actual fluctuations are the same.</p>

<div class="md"><p>I think the answer is we don&#39;t know for sure.</p>

<p>The hypothesis I&#39;ve heard is:
1) fat cells full of fat
2) diet, fat in fat cells replaced with water (maybe to keep space available to refill with fat if food comes back?)
3) diet more, water finally clears from fat cells (body realizes food isn&#39;t coming back?)</p>

<div class="md"><p>I&#39;m really not following your logic here. When you catabolize fat your osmolality of the cell does not change. You don&#39;t have cellular swelling because of a change in fat content. </p>

<p><a href="https://www.mdcalc.com/serum-osmolality-osmolarity">Here&#39;s the calculation for looking at serum osmolality and there is nothing in there about fat concentration.</a></p>

<div class="md"><p>From the article from lyle referenced:</p>

<p>&quot;What’s going on?  Back during my college days, one of my professors threw out the idea that after fat cells had been emptied of stored triglyceride, they would temporarily refill with water (glycerol attracts water, which might be part of the mechanism).  So there would be no immediate change in size, body weight or appearance.</p>

<p>Then, after some time frame, the water would get dropped, the fat cells would shrink.  A weird way of looking at it might be that the fat loss suddenly becomes ‘apparent’. That is, the fat was emptied and burned off days or weeks ago but until the water is dropped, nothing appears to have happened.</p>

<p>For nearly 20 years I looked for research to support this, I was never sure if it was based on something from the 50’s or he just pulled it out of thin air as an explanation.  Recently, one paper did suggest that visceral fat can fill up with water after massive weight loss but that’s about it.&quot;</p>

<div class="md"><p>That&#39;s a really neat hypothesis, but it is still not based on any physiologic reality I can think of. <a href="https://youtu.be/raW6b5kQHPY">Here&#39;s a great video of the mechanism behind water status in various compartments within the body</a>.

<div class="md"><p>Renaissance Periodization is of the opinion that it&#39;s related to stress hormones i.e. increased cortisol = water retention. And dieting for long periods of time is an great way to increase stress.</p>

<div class="md"><p>When you&#39;re using fat as a fuel source your body creates ketone bodies which help your body retain water. It takes time to get rid of those completely since you keep producing them by being at a caloric deficit. Eventually your body requires less energy and produces less ketone bodies allowing your kidneys to fully clear them, along with the water they hold. It&#39;s more technical than that in order to be 100% physiologically accurate, but it&#39;s a decent layman&#39;s answer.</p>

<div class="md"><p>Here is what is really going on.</p>

<p>You are eating extra salty foods and diet beverages to compensate because you are in a calorie deficit</p>

<p>So by doing that, you body is holding some extra water. I wouldn&#39;t worry too much about it though.</p>

<p>I easily drop 10lbs overnight sleeping 8hrs.</p>
