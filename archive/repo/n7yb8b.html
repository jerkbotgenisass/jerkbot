<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Y&#39;all have been real quiet since <a href="https://www.tau.ac.il/%7Erani/nutro.pdf">this</a> dropped. (I&#39;m not actually sure if it has caused any buzz in the fitness world but it&#39;s a big meme with the econ grad students I know right now.)</p>

<p>Eliaz and Spiegler, theoretical microeconomists you might know from <em>Incentive-Compatible Advertising on Non-Retail Platforms</em> [1] or <em>On Persuasion with Endogenous Misspecified Beliefs</em> [2], &quot;appl[y] tools from economic theory to the field of exercise physiology [...] by modeling the body as a forward-looking optimizing agent [to] gain insights into the effectiveness of popular physical training strategies.&quot;</p>

<h1>Paper Summary</h1>

<p>The core of their approach seems to be pitting the cost of maintaining muscle mass vs. the cost of not having enough muscle mass (i.e., the &quot;energy costs of repairing torn muscle tissue&quot; or the inability to perform a physical task, with the gap between required and current muscle mass as a cost). In response to dynamic exercise stimuli, the body, as a rational actor, makes incremental adjustments to its muscle mass in anticipation of future training stimuli.</p>

<p>As is standard in exercise physiology, the authors assume that all training programs are finite-state Markov chains (for instance, the Westside Barbell or Bulgarian Method programs slot neatly into this framework) over the exercise intensity <code>d</code>. The cost (in each period) of maintaining an amount of muscle mass <code>m</code> is:</p>

<pre><code>c * m + max{0, d - m}
</code></pre>

<p>where <code>c</code> is a constant representing the maintenance cost (we require <code>c &lt; 1</code> for the analysis to be non-trivial; otherwise, the agent&#39;s best strategy is clearly to increase mass at each step, which is only rational if you&#39;re Dexter Jackson) and <code>d</code> represents the intensity of the exercise stimulus in the current period. That is, the total cost is the cost of <em>maintaining</em> mass, plus the gap between the current mass and the mass demanded by the exercise stimulus.</p>

<p>The body, as a rational actor, responds with a &quot;best-reply&quot; to the stimulus in the given period, by either incrementing mass by 1 unit, decrementing mass by 1 unit, or leaving mass fixed. That is, the body is a <em>sluggish</em> agent. A body with the ability to instantaneously change its muscle mass (a <em>flexible</em> agent) would clearly make you exactly as big as you need to be to perform the current exercise (which, while ideal for strength sports, doesn&#39;t appear to mesh with real-world experience). Here, we can view the mass <code>m</code> as a <em>capacity</em> to do exercise.</p>

<p>The goal of the trainer is to select a Markov process (training program) that maximizes the average of <code>m</code> in the long-run (I haven&#39;t personally undergone ACSM or NASM training, but I&#39;m pretty sure this is what they teach). We write <code>µ</code> for the maximum long-run average mass for a constant-intensity exercise program.</p>

<p>We seek to answer the question that has plagued proponents of exercise since the first Olympic games (the 776 BC ones, not the 1896 ones, though the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1904_Summer_Olympics">1904 Summer Olympics</a> <em>were</em> the greatest all-time sporting event): does there exist some non-degenerate Markov process (exercise program) with which results in a long-run average mass greater than <code>µ</code>?</p>

<p>Fortunately, this problem resembles a problem from the microeconomic literature called Bayesian persuasion [4], which enables us to use similar techniques to tackle it. Further experimental work is required to discern the agent&#39;s (body&#39;s) <em>discount factor</em> -- that is, how far into the future it considers when adjusting mass. Until then, the authors focus on two extremes: a <em>myopic</em> agent, with a discount factor of zero, and an arbitrarily <em>patient</em> agent.</p>

<p>The core results are:</p>

<ol>
<li>The myopic agent updates using a strategy <em>independent</em> of the training program. With such an approach, no agent can obtain a long-run muscle mass above <code>2µ - 1</code>. The authors give a training program that realizes this: a given time period has exercise stimulus <code>0</code> (rest period) or <code>2µ</code> (high-intensity period). Every rest period is immediately followed by a high-intensity period; every high-intensity period with is followed by a rest period with probability arbitrarily close to one.</li>
<li>For the patient agent, the (provable) maximal long-run value of <code>m</code> is <code>µ/c - 1</code>. To achieve this, we have rest periods (<code>0</code> stimulus) and high-intensity periods (stimulus <code>µ / c</code>). We follow each rest period with a high-intensity period. We follow a high-intensity period with a rest period with probability <code>c</code>, or a another high-intensity period with probability <code>1-c</code>.</li>
</ol>

<p>These results give a theoretical undergirding for the familiar concept of <em>periodization</em>. Some exercise scientists have arrogantly offered biological explanations for the effectiveness of periodization, but the &quot;rational yet sluggish adaptation of the body to fluctuations in physical stimuli&quot; offers a clearly more-parsimonious explanation.</p>

<h1>My review</h1>

<p>The strengths of this work:</p>

<ul>
<li>The model subsumes the field of exercise physiology, rendering the 340,000 personal trainers in the US and most of the output of Stronger by Science obsolete.</li>
<li>An exhaustive bibliography -- for example, they cite <em>Kinesiology for Dummies</em> [3], which I understand to be a foundational text.</li>
<li>An accompanying <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=onUrRs3kHIE">training(?) video</a>.</li>
</ul>

<p>And weaknesses:</p>

<ul>
<li>The authors look like <a href="https://static.wixstatic.com/media/cf50a1_d25b111979cd493da1ce30c23d54db38.jpg/v1/fill/w_560,h_434,al_c,q_80,usm_0.66_1.00_0.01/cf50a1_d25b111979cd493da1ce30c23d54db38.webp">this</a> and <a href="https://www.ucl.ac.uk/economics/sites/economics/files/styles/large_image/public/Ran.jpg?itok=puYtAwlu">this</a>.</li>
<li>By imposing the requirement that the Markov processes are finite state, the authors prematurely rule out the possibility of infinite gainz.</li>
</ul>

<p>I&#39;m leaning towards &quot;Strong Accept with Minor Revisions&quot; (the authors should bring someone jacked on as a co-author before publication).</p>

<h1>Takeaways for your training</h1>

<p>This really depends on your physiology: do you have a myopic body or a patient body?</p>

<p>If you have a myopic body, alternate between rest periods and bouts of exercise that require strength corresponding to your genetic potential.</p>

<p>If you have a patient body, alternate between rest periods and bouts of exercise that require strength corresponding to your genetic potential, <em>but</em> every time you do one of these high-intensity bouts, flip a coin that gives heads with probability proportional to the cost of maintaining muscle mass. If it comes up tails, do another high-intensity bout of exercise.</p>

<p>Your genetic potential in each case will be different; the above should be clear enough for you to work out its exact value.</p>

<h1>Where do we go from here?</h1>

<p>While the work <em>does</em> entirely obviate the need for such a thing as &quot;exercise&quot; &quot;science,&quot; it leaves open several questions of theoretical interest:</p>

<ul>
<li>SBS pod theoretical microeconomics episode when?</li>
