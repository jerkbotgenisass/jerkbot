What should I expect by only eating Baked Beans with Milk? (28M 5'9)

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Breakfast: Baked beans+milk. 600 cals </p>

<p>Second breakfast: Baked beans+milk. 600 cals</p>

<p>Lunch: Baked beans+milk. 600 cals</p>

<p>Dinner: Baked beans+milk. 600 cals</p>

<p>That&#39;s 2400 cals not counting junk that I might decide to have </p>

<p>I went from 130 LBS to 162 LBS (at age 27, 5&#39;9) within 50 days by eating 1 mcdonalds and large 1 Yazoo everyday (nothing else) which is around 1500 cals but dropped back to 130 LBS cause I moved house and no deliveroos for mcdonalds here.</p>

<p>The reason for this madness is I can&#39;t be bothered with anything that requires effort and beans is quick and easy. What should I expect?</p>
