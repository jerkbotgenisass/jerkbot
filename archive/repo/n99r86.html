<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>The gift of god. The ability to heal thyself on the spot, every day you wake up you have a chance to be born a new.</p>

<p>society tells you to eat 3 meals a day and snack inbetween.</p>

<p>But i got news for you.</p>

<p>the less you eat the stronger you will be mentally and physically and spiritually.</p>

<p>The more you are clogged up with food the easier it is to pacify you.</p>

<p>Reject their food.</p>

<p>Eat only when you need to. </p>

<p>Fasting is a gift that god gives to all animals. But he gave us the gift to pratice it when we will. not just when we are sick.</p>

<div class="md"><p>great advice. I used to strongly believe in the meme about breakfast being the most important meal of the day, but my experience since then has shown that to be false. I used to wake up and eat breakfast and then get hungry by eleven, but if I skip breakfast I can feel great and energized until about 1 pm.</p>

<div class="md"><p>I was raised in the proverbial land of milk and honey and at the age of 23 or so realized I had never really, truly been hungry and gone a single day without food. I tried it one day for the experience and... it sucks... especially at first if you are used to eating and snacking all the time. However after a day of fasting I felt fine, and began to eat again. I think it is good for you and your body sort of looks for nutrition where it can in the body and cleans out all sorts of stuff. An entirely unscientific explanation yes, but one that I believe in. Long story short if you have lived a really privileged life and never had to go without food for a day, give it a try, your body may thank you.</p>

<div class="md"><p>Autophagy is something your body goes through 24/7 for your entire life regardless of what you eat. Your body is constantly repairing itself. Your bones heal after they break, your skin regenerates after it’s cut or burned, new cells are created every second. You don’t have to fast for that to happen.</p>

<p>Fasting for health rather than spiritual growth is just another fad diet that most people don’t stick to because it eventually burns you out. Wanna know the secret to why you might feel good on a fast? It’s because your body releases endorphins and adrenaline because it’s dying for you to go out and find something to eat ASAP. It’s trying to provide you with the energy you need to do so. It’s also the reason why your sense of smell improves, so you can find food easier. But it’s not good for your body and your health to be in a constant state of high alert. It burns you out and you will start to feel like shit</p>

<p>You shouldn’t eat 6 meals a day and stuff your face but you shouldn’t starve yourself either. Skip breakfast and then only eat healthy non processed foods instead like fruits and vegetables.</p>

<div class="md"><p>What you’re saying isn’t necessarily true. There is a lot of literature and information about intermittent fasting as a lifestyle as opposed to a fad diet. I recommend watching some of Dr Jason Fungs videos on YouTube since he will explain it a lot better than I am about to. </p>

<p>When you eat your body increases insulin, which is the hormone used to regulate sugar and store energy . When your body is producing insulin it is constantly in a storing state and struggled to produce other hormones, such as Human Growth hormone, which comes back to your whole autophagy argument. </p>

<p>When you’re fasted, and your insulin is low, your body has a chance to use its fat stores (anabolic state) as well fire up other processes, as above. </p>

<p>Again, not the best person to be describing this process but if anyone is even remotely interested, check out Dr Jason Fung or the other TedTalks in YouTube. </p>

<p>Also, as someone who does IF, you won’t break down and fail to function if you don’t stuff your face for 20 hours a day. A bit of self control is good for you, and as long as you’re taking in your recommended calories in your eating window you’ll be fine.</p>

<div class="md"><p>I agree that fasting should be more of a spiritual thing than a health thing but you’re dead wrong about skipping breakfast. Last I checked, no one eats when they’re asleep and your body needs fuel after having gone without one for however long you slept plus the hours after your final meal before going to sleep. </p>

<p>Skipping meals is NOT a good thing. You’re fat? Eat smaller meals or meals with less calories. It’s as simple as that and skipping meals doesn’t help.</p>

<div class="md"><p>The fact that you think autophagy is the same as healing is pretty strong evidence that you don&#39;t understand it at all.</p>

<p>Autophagy is a natural cellular mechanism by which the cells in our body degrade unnecessary or damaged components within the cell. The process of autophagy helps maintain normal functioning (homeostasis) in the cell. The term “autophagy” literally means “self-eating.”</p>

<p>Autophagy is your body recycling dead cells. </p>

<p>Healing is repairing cells or producing more cells.</p>

<p>Also there is evidence that being in a state of ketosis increases autophagy. Calorie restriction promotes ketosis.</p>

<div class="md"><p>I wouldnt call it fasting but I&#39;ve been eating &#39;when I feel like it&#39; for as long as I can remember. Which means there are periods of time I&#39;m just in a flow and I dont feel like eating so I wont. Then when I&#39;m hungry I make something to eat.

<div class="md"><p>I agree with this perspective. Your body will tell you when it requires nutrients and even use cravings to point you in the right direction. </p>

<p>I see fasting as a once in a while clean out method to remove the over stock build up of some nutrients, kind of like flushing your radiator system on a car, but not some magic cure all.</p>

<div class="md"><p>Yeah, exactly. I eat when my body tells me to.  I do a fair amount of exercise and bring food on my bike rides since &quot;bonking&quot; is a horrible experience (feeling utterly fatigued and shaky) if I&#39;m exercising and lack energy.  I tried intermittent fasting (16 hours a day), but I find I exercise less with such a regime.  For me, the most optimal way to live (in terms of health) is:-</p>

<ul>
<li>eat when you&#39;re hungry (and ensure it&#39;s 95% whole foods, it&#39;s 95% and not 100%, because nobody&#39;s perfect and I still love occasional chocolate bars). </li>
<li>exercise regularly</li>
<li>sleep early-ish (9PM to 10PM)</li>
<li>get 15 to 25 mins of direct summer sun and/or supplement on vitamin D (I live in Thailand so can get strong sun all year around)</li>
<li>have a hobby/hobbies</li>
</ul>

<p>Pretty boring advice...but everything else feels fad-ish and extreme to me.</p>

<div class="md"><p>My boiler is currently broken and can only hold several of liters of water (as opposed to several douzens).</p>

<p>&#x200B;</p>

<p>For the past week, when I take a shower, I got about 5 minutes of nice steaming hot water, absolute bliss. Then my shower forces me to do Wim Hoff manouvres. I&#39;m making a point out of it to stay as long as possible under the cold water lol.</p>

<p>&#x200B;</p>

<p>I&#39;m not gonna say my life is changed, or that I feel amazing, but atleast I&#39;m no longer shivering when I get out of the shower. The (bath) room actually feels pretty good, as opposed to always freezing to death and wrapping myself in towels when I leave the shower.</p>

<div class="md"><p>Yep. All the way down. If you start small, like 5-15 second increments each day, you&#39;ll be up to 2 minutes in a couple weeks. I think there&#39;s some value in transitioning from the hot to the cold too. Getting in the mindset and actually doing it is an important part of the process. It never became a pleasant thing, but I did find it exhilarating and... satisfying?</p>

<p>It has been a while since I&#39;ve done it and my brain feels kind of flabby these days. I have actually already been thinking I should pick it up again. Maybe this interaction is just the thing to get me to finally do it.</p>

<div class="md"><p>When I began, it was more comfortable to enter the shower in the temperature that you usually enter and as you start to feel warm just shut down the hot water and let the cold water come in. Stand under the cold water as long as you can, but don&#39;t force yourself too much. It gets easier and easier over time. As of now I just turn the cold water on and take my bath.</p>

<p>What I get from it is a sense of relaxed and focused mind. I don&#39;t usually get shivers and my skin feels hot as I exit the shower (others also feel my skin being hot as I exit). Other than that, I can&#39;t say if there are other benefits. Some people say that there is.</p>

<div class="md"><p>Yes. Im not totally strict with it. But I tend to not eat for about 20 hours and then allow myself to eat in a window of 4-5 hours. I still eat homemade fries on occasion, I still eat some chocolate or icecream now and then. But overall it has helped me tremendous. My whole digestive system has improved. If you are thinking about trying, start off slow. just have a lighter breakfast as usual, or skip breakfast and have lunch and diner. It didnt take me very long to get used to a new diet regime. I now cycle for 70 km (40 miles) and don&#39;t even get hungry. if I do get a bit hungry, I drink some carbonated water and it disapears. Then I get home and have a good healthy meat potato vegetable meal. I try to avoid or limit sugar and carbs. But pasta is yummy, so I try to have a smaller portion. I love it and can recommend it. <a href="/r/fasting">r/fasting</a> or myself can help you with more questions. greetings from the netherlands!</p>

<p>Wow....you must surely only do these rides after your 4 hour window of eating, right? I get that the ride itself doesn&#39;t require food...I&#39;ve done such rides before quite a lot (just drank fluids on the ride), but I&#39;ve never ever started a ride hungry...that&#39;s just asking for trouble.  So I guess you must be doing these after you&#39;ve eaten.</p>

<div class="md"><p>As a RN who works busy night shifts I tend to naturally fast for about 14-16 hours, maybe eating 1.5 meals a day. The issue I am having is I have chronic migraines and they are really amplified towards the end of my fasting window. When I push myself to the 20 hr range, I’m usually nauseous and useless from pain that I have no interest in food or doing any work. I know this is a specific issues but I’m wondering how common this is and if it’s something that your body just needs to adjust to?</p>

<div class="md"><p>I do the 20/4 with the 4 hour eating window that starts at 2pm.  It&#39;s not perfect.  Between about 10am &amp; 2pm, I noticed I get really irritable &amp; I snap at people.

<div class="md"><p>If you get irritable and anxious at 10 AM, that’s your body telling you it needs something. It shouldn’t be ignored. If you included 10 AM-2 PM in your eating window, you’d be at 16/8, which a lot of people do and report tremendous benefits from. Why not do that?</p>

<div class="md"><p>I just realized that this was a thing, but I&#39;ve done the same for many years. Only difference is my &quot;breakfast&quot; starts around dinner time, and I eat till I&#39;m content, not full.

<div class="md"><p>I have to chime in here to say that I totally agree. I did 16/8 fasting during Lent to try and lose a bit of weight (i had never dieter or fastes before) and I was amazed at how quickly the weight fell off me! And I felt amazing after the first few days of getting over the hunger pangs. I also gave up tea for Lent and that contributed to the weight loss and feeling good 👍</p>

<div class="md"><p>Yes I always have 2 sugars in my tea, and I was over-eating (as in just whenever I felt a tiny pang of hunger I&#39;d go and have a sandwich or a snack between meals). So I used Lent as the catalyst to start fasting, and it worked out for me. I only ate 2 meals a day, no snacks, no sweets, no tea. Only water, and lunch and dinner.</p>

<p>Edit: I lost a stone and a half in the 6 weeks of Lent, which is about 9 kilos).</p>

<div class="md"><p>Intermittent fasting is amazing. I can easily go on all day if I&#39;m busy.</p>

<p>I&#39;ve tried fasting before and done up to 100 hours of a complete fast (no calories, just water), even went to the gym before breaking it to lift weights and I remember getting a massive pump; had a bit less endurance but was just as strong.</p>

<p>The last few times I&#39;ve been tempted to fast, my appetite was too strong. When come fall/winter, my appetite is always significantly stronger, and every year I gain weight around that time. There are studies that show appetite increasing when days get shorter; I feel particularly sensitive to these daylight variations.</p>

<div class="md"><p>Fasting for health rather than spiritual growth is just another fad diet that most people don’t stick to because it eventually burns you out. Wanna know the secret to why you might feel good on a fast? It’s because your body releases endorphins and adrenaline because it’s dying for you to go out and find something to eat ASAP. It’s trying to provide you with the energy you need to do so. </p>

<p>It’s also the reason why your sense of smell improves, so you can find food easier. But it’s not good for your body and your health to be in a constant state of high alert. It burns you out and you will start to feel like shit</p>

<p>You shouldn’t eat 6 meals a day and stuff your face but you shouldn’t starve yourself either. Skip breakfast and then only eat healthy non processed foods instead like fruits and vegetables.</p>

<div class="md"><p>I’ve never fasted for any real length of time, but I have eaten a very low carb diet, which similarly restricts insulin production. I felt great, and far less hungry, eating that way, so I’m sympathetic to people who love fasting. Agree with you, best to consult a doctor before making any drastic change -  so long as you’re certain your doctor is up to date with the latest research. The New England Journal of Medicine has published some studies on intermittent fasting, for instance, that suggest it’s very good for you (like <a href="https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/nejmra1905136">this one</a>).</p>

<p>I doubt any of you have even fasted all that much or even done legitimate fasting. You know what actual fasting done for an extended period of time? You get less sleep. You go to sleep hungry because you didn’t get to eat enough and you wake up after only a few hours because you’re still hungry and your body wants you to eat. </p>

<p>I’m a dude who can easily sleep 9 hours. When I was fasting I could barely sleep 6 hours a night. You don’t feel refreshed, you’re not strong in any sort of manner. Even what you said you did isn’t fasting, that’s OMAD (one meal a day). </p>

<p>Not trying to be mean but most of y’all don’t even know what fasting actually is.</p>

<div class="md"><p>The challenge is the transition from burning carbs for your calories to being adapted to burn ketones and fats. Then you&#39;re not hungry and don&#39;t run out of energy during that conference call.

<div class="md"><p>It’s not doable for everyone, and that’s okay. Don’t let yourself feel intimidated by people who claim you get magical super powers at the 36-hour mark. Plenty of people report benefits with 18/6, 16/4, or even 14/10. Hell, Dr. Rhonda Patrick says that even if you can’t do extended fasting, fitting your eating into a 12-hour window and then giving yourself 12 hours of no eating (which can include sleeping) can still confer benefits.</p>

<p>You don&#39;t realize how scared you are of being hungry in your everyday life (despite food being extremely abundant in our society) until you&#39;ve sort of freed yourself from that fear after fasting for 36 hours + and still feeling great. For those reading, may not work if you&#39;re new to this, I have over 15 years of experience of generally low carbing and doing intermittent fasting (although went significant bouts without doing it). I need to do more fasts (I define as a fast going at least an entire day without eating calories), I remember how great it has felt in the past.</p>

<div class="md"><p>Idk if this belongs here, but nevertheless here you go: Two years ago I promised a Muslim friend of mine, who was my room mate back then, that I’d go through the Islamic month of fasting called Ramadan with him. Therefore I fasted one whole month and only ate in the evenings at Iftar time. In the mornings around 2 am I only ate an egg or drank a glass of water. It is really, really hard, however, you can’t imagine how good you feel after that month. You feel like you reduced the dark side of your body.</p>

<div class="md"><p>truth.</p>

<p>I have found through personal experimentation that I only begin experiencing actual hunger after 3 or 4 days without food, and even though this is an individual thing, the fact is that the big food mantra of 3 meals a day is, just like everything else, a scam designed to perpetuate a big business special interest (big food) and the media and government exist to propagate and protect that (and many other) scams. Most people feel sugar pangs every X hours and think thats hunger. It is not. For a carb/sugar addict, those are literally drug urges. I know that wont be popular but its true.</p>

<div class="md"><p>me too - and I notice I even need less sleep. However, I notice for myself that after 4 or 5 days of fasting, even though I am physically stronger and mentally more alert, I begin to obsess about being hungry, which becomes too distracting to focus on other aspects of life, and therefore in my own life, a fasting period of 6 days or so is essentially a max..</p>

<p>Im not sure if this is just an artifact of my own psychology or not.</p>

<p>However, as I said, the actual truth is that people in general are better off with a drastically reduced eating frequency, IMO at MOST once a day (OMAD), and again this is very dependent on the individual and their own physiology and lifestyle, but I think for many people the optimal eating frequency can be once per 3 days or so (rolling fasts of 72 hours).</p>

<div class="md"><p>Agree!!! Plus the way the world going now and the pending attack on our supply chain. fasting will be the best skill to pick up. Its probably one of the best skills and one of the most beautiful art forms if done properly.</p>

<p>Fasting also increases your efficiency meaning. You would get more nutrients from food and more hydration from water. You absorption would be god tier.</p>

<div class="md"><p>totally agree.</p>

<p>Like so many other facets of life, the masses are spoon fed a narrative designed to support special interests. The truth is far different.</p>

<p>Everyone has their own optimal eating frequency, IMO, but in no case is it multiple meals per day. My opinion.</p>

<div class="md"><p>Three meals a day simply came with industrialization: eat a meal before work, at half a day of work, then one after work.</p>

<p>People don&#39;t understand it&#39;s a dogma that&#39;s not based on any kind of science. There is also no science behind breakfast being &quot;the most important meal of the day&quot;. Let alone with stuffing kids with sugar in the morning as if what they needed to stay focused in school was a glycemic crash a few hours later making them hungry.</p>
