<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Not to be to detailed but since I’ve been doing Keto I don’t have to go to the bathroom for sometimes 5 days.  And the one day I do have to go it’s several emergencies.  The first time in the morning  it’s normal and I’m like, ok maybe I’m starting to regulate again but then it’s several emergencies throughout the day and then the next 5 or so days nothing.  Is this normal?</p>

<div class="md"><p>I used to go 2-3 times per day. Now I go once a day and sometimes skip a day.  That seems fairly normal and makes sense since I&#39;m eating smaller portions and a lot less filler.</p>

<p>But if you&#39;re spanning 3 days and being backed up such that it&#39;s like the flood gates opening, I&#39;d definitely dial in your electrolytes and up your hydration.  If that doesn&#39;t level it out some, look into some psyllium husk to add a bit of fiber.  I add 1/2 tsp to protein shakes more to reduce the stickiness of my stool than for regularity but I know others have found it useful for regularity.</p>

<p>I&#39;m not really sure if it&#39;s normal, but my body works the same way.</p>

<div class="md"><p>I take magnesium and potassium supplements or my #2 is rock hard. I am not usually a 1 time a day person, but on keto it is and could be twice. And I NEVER trust a keto fart. Learned that the hard way!</p>

<div class="md"><p>Electrolytes, especially magnesium, help me stay regular. I personally also get 20g of fiber. But fiber isn&#39;t always the answer for everyone.</p>
