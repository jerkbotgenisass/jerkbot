<div class="md"><p>I always thought it was strange that people cited the advent of agriculture as the era we started eating those plants.</p>

<p>How did they know which plants they wanted to cultivate, or which ones were valuable if they hadn’t been eating them for some time prior? </p>

<p>And It’s not like root vegetables don’t have stuff sticking out of the ground to identify them by. Scavengers would have found them easily.</p>

<div class="md"><p>I had read the theory that even though hunter gatherers were nomadic, they would have regular spots where camping was frequent. The plants that they liked would be consumed in the camp and the seeds excreted around it, making the spot actually more and more desirable through selection (I am not sure whether to call it artificial or natural selection).</p>

<p>It makes sense that some spots became natural gardens over time and that domestication of plants kinda started before agriculture, in a more unconscious way.</p>

<div class="md"><p>Gosh, I guess American education has changed a lot in the 25 years since I was in elementary school... </p>

<p>I remember learning about the Iroquois nation and how we had diplomatic relations with them and the well developed Navajo society, and the code talker contributions during WWII as well.(not saying we didn&#39;t learn about others, just what I recall off the top of my head). </p>

<p>I recall we learned about specific tribes that were considered warlike(mainly the Comanche and how we couldn&#39;t beat them, but included other groups like the Apache as well), but generally that had to do with westward expansion and the cowboy era being so popular. </p>

<p>By high school I&#39;d also learned about the way we&#39;d treated the natives, Sand Creek, Little Big Horn, the Trail of Tears. I hope things haven&#39;t regressed that much...</p>

<div class="md"><p>There’s some excellent ‘research’ on this emerging at the moment. I say research in inverted commas, because the detail has never been lost or hidden, just never really acknowledged in contemporary Australian or education or culture.</p>

<p>The Aboriginal cultures are all oral traditions, so the knowledge of the land was passed down through song and stories. This is a terrible simplification though - for Aboriginal people, their culture, the land, their identity, art, and the stories are all part of the same system. You belong to ‘Country’ and have a responsibility to the specific creatures and plants in it. So the songs would tell stories about how things were made, the seasons, the where and the why of the country. Different nations and different mobs within nations might have responsibility or knowledge about different aspects of the land.</p>

<p>Even more interesting is the idea that Aboriginals were not really nomadic. They moved from place to place, but in many instances these would be re-visited on a regular basis for generations (50-60,000 years of continuous culture, unbroken by significant internals wars or assimilation, determined through DNA and language analysis).</p>

<p>So rather than the idea of savages wandering in the wilderness, the reality is that Aboriginal mobs would travel from garden to garden, depending on the time of year and other factors. The locations, connections, purpose and how to care for these gardens was passed down through story, art and song.</p>

<p>There’s a lot of evident that the wilderness was carefully cared for and actually ‘kept’. The ‘fire stick farming’ is well known, but not so well known if the deliberate cultivation of yams and seed-grasses through enormous stretches of the country.</p>

<p>And so back to the topic, this includes the native yams which are an excellent source of starch, and were heavily cultivated. It’s just this cultivation was totally unlike the sedentary farming that the British knew, and so was never accepted.</p>

<p>The source for this comes from the written accounts of early European explorers - it’s not historically contentious.</p>

<div class="md"><blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>&quot;Regular&quot; potatoes (<em>Solanum tuberosum</em>) came to Europe, Asia, and Africa as part of the Columbian Exchange. </p>

<p>Sweet potatoes (<em>Ipomoea batatas</em>) were spread by Polynesians. There&#39;s some debate as to whether Polynesians brought them from South America directly, or <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-018-04488-4">whether the sweet potato was already in Polynesia</a>.</p>

<p>For a while, accepted wisdom was that Polynesians brought chickens to South America, but even that is in question, <a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/thetwo-way/2014/03/18/291182073/study-the-chicken-didnt-cross-the-pacific-to-south-america">give developments in genetic analysis of chickens</a>. </p>

<p>So while there&#39;s evidence that Polynesians may have reached the Americas, trade in potatoes and chickens isn&#39;t the reason people are confused about those food origins. That&#39;s the result of the Columbian exchange. </p>

<p>Indigenous American agriculture transformed world cuisine dramatically, and that&#39;s rarely acknowledged (think tomatoes, potatoes, capsicum/chili peppers, vanilla, cacao, squash, peanuts, maize etc.). They&#39;ve managed to become staple ingredients in &quot;traditional&quot; dishes all throughout Eurasia and Africa.</p>

<div class="md"><p>They actually have seemingly accurate tales of floods after the last ice age, that accurately match the time line for flooding. We have found remnants of flooded settlements/cut off settlements that match aboriginal stories.</p>

<p>Of course they stories have been spiced up a bit over time. One really good book I read about it us called The Edge of Memory. Its mostly about aboriginals but has some fascinating stories from around the world about oral history.</p>

<div class="md"><p>Depends on the crop, some seeds would just be thrown away before eating, probably with a lot of fertile trash if not manure. And the seeds that did not resist intestinal transit, well, were selected against in that grand scheme of things!</p>

<p>Note that domestication could later lead to the loss of resistance to digestion, as it became unnecessary, but it is a pretty reasonable mechanism to explain the beginning of plants domestication before the invention of agriculture.</p>

<div class="md"><p>IIRC most of these plants are native to the area but have been cultivated by the indians. When the Europeans came to North America there were permanent indian settlements all over the place surrounded with fields of cultivated plants. When people say that agriculture were invented in Mesopotamia 10000 years ago they are talking about industrial scale agriculture with controlled irrigation and dedicated workforces for each task with highly specialized tools. Small scale farming and cultivation have been around for much longer then this and is what this study is likely refering to. There are plenty of uncultivated edible plants which certainly can give you plenty of starch in your diet but it was not until humans started cultivating plants that you were able to have a diet based around these plants.</p>

<div class="md"><p>Yes, there are of course lots of individual oppinions about what people prefer being called. But my impression is that most of the people insisting on refering to Indians as Native Americans confuse the Indians with the African Americans and do not actually have much knowledge about the matter. But the term Indian does not have the same negative implications as other terms for African Americans. In fact the term Native have been used as a negative slang far more often then Indian. It is actually quite interesting how different minority cultures handles the problems of derogatory terms and either embraces it and transforms it into a badge of honor or tries to erase it from use.</p>

<div class="md"><p>I agree. It seems natural for a nomadic group that travels the same route annually to notice that seeds grow new plants the next year, then to make sure those seeds are stuffed into the ground before they leave. If they took some seeds with them to try planting in other places (seems likely this would be attempted by ever-curious humans) they would develop knowledge about what conditions best suited the growth of different plants. </p>

<p>Eventually you&#39;d get enough food/seed stock and generational knowledge about agriculture to decide to just stay put (at least for a little while) instead of running around indefinitely.</p>

<div class="md"><blockquote>
<p>The problem is that they don&#39;t really grow everywhere. </p>

<p>They really are quite abundant, if you downgrade your expectations.  I&#39;m on the US east cost, and I could easily gather a hundred pounds of Tuckahoe root (arrow arum), which is starchy but requires processing to remove toxins.  It was a staple food for Native Americans in the area.  Swamp iris is also common- the root is starchy, edible, and rather stringy if you&#39;re accustomed to potatoes.  Acorns are another example- they&#39;re edible with processing.  Burdock is a common weed of vacant lots, the root is starchy and edible, but bitter and somewhat  woody.  It is called Gobo in Japanese cuisine, most cultures don&#39;t bother with it.</p>

<p>I&#39;m using the environment I&#39;m familiar with as an example, it is not the climate where humans evolved.  The point is that starchy edible roots are pretty widespread, if you expand your definition beyond the palatable roots that we prefer today.</p>

<p>Your larger point about a pseudo agricultural system is profound.  Why would Homo erectus <em>not</em> do that?  And if we accept it as probable, they must have had a huge impact on their local ecosystems.  No one knows what most of North America would look like without the landscape management of the Native Americans; the land the colonists entered was a managed ecosystem.  This management started as soon as the glaciers receded.  Much of Africa and Eurasia were probably under that kind of management by fire long before the glaciers receded.</p>

<p>Eating meat every meal is a modern luxury that wasn&#39;t common even after agriculture. Stretches where food was entirely plant derived were common. </p>

<p>We&#39;re extrapolating our modern idea of a diet rich in meat onto ancient humans, while it might not be fair to say it was <em>mostly</em> plants, if a modern person living in America or Europe were forced to to eat their diet and had to go days, weeks, or a month or two with only small portions of meat or none they probably wouldn&#39;t describe it as a meat rich diet in the modern sense.</p>

<div class="md"><p>I said we ate everything thing edible. </p>

<p>Meat is included in that but there&#39;s increasing evidence from various excavations that we harvested large amounts of plants as well. And yes, they were &quot;random&quot; in that they included a wide variety of plants. Acorns, berries, reeds, fruit from trees, grains, etc. </p>

<p>Meat was hard to obtain before animal farming. They did eat meat, but less often then we do today. Today we eat meat every meal. Our ancestors wouldn&#39;t have been able to do that. Hunting took time and our ancestors frequently hunted animals till populations were low. It&#39;s why many species of megafauna went extinct. </p>

<p>While some homo sp fossils show a meat heavy diet, many also show signs of large amounts of vegetation consumption such as wear and tear on teeth from fibrous plants. Modern humans that eat meat every meal don&#39;t have these signs of wear and tear. The presence of this suggest they were eating much more plants then we do now, at least for long stretchs even if they also went through meat heavy periods. </p>

<p>Speaking of what we know from bones, Neanderthals have been recently revealed to have been revealed to have eaten much more vegetation than previous thought, revealed through study of their bones. </p>

<p>Our understanding of diet before these technique of using bone composition to really understand what they were eating day to day was to go based off of what we found around their settlements. Bones preserve much better then plant material. Thats why we can still them today, they preserve so well. That means that the bones we find around their settlements are a collection of ALL the animals every generation that lived there ate, meaning the amount of bones we found were going to be high even if they werent eating meat every meal. Researchers from the past though concluded that they ate more meat then agricultural societies. </p>

<p>New techniques have also revealed that before agriculture proper, forest gardening was very prevalent. Human ancestors learned pretty early on to remove plants they weren&#39;t edible, and to spread those that were around the areas they lived, demonstrating a strong reliance on plant food sources. </p>

<p>Modern hunter gather tribes also have periods without access to meat. African hunter gather tribes will have periods of unsuccessful hunts and will fall back on seeds, tubers, roots, fruit  etc. In the Amazon, they also deal with this. </p>

<p>While meat did make up a significant portion of their diet, it wasn&#39;t as big a part as it is in say modern America where we eat meat every meal, every day. Wild populations of animals don&#39;t reach levels that can sustain various human tribes relying on them solely for food that way. </p>

<p>I guess it was unfair to say it was <em>mostly</em> plants, but compared to our diet now, it certainly included more meals that were solely plants then our modern diet. Domestication of animals is the development that lead to meat being a every meal luxury. It wasn&#39;t possible till we were raising animals in and around our settlements so that we didn&#39;t have to spend large amounts of time hunting them, they were just there to slaughter and even then, some societies have been shown to have still had problems raising enough animals to consistently eat meat. In northern Europe they raised animals and hunted, yet bone analysis shows they mostly ate plants with meat making up a smaller part of their diet then what it does now.</p>

<div class="md"><p>For real.  I remember when the paleo diet was actually a really reasonable and healthy sounding option.  These days it&#39;s incarnation is nutso.  </p>

<p>I got into paleo like 10+ years ago and it was super sensible.  Small amounts of meat, lots of veggies and root vegetables, lots of in-season fruits and some nuts.  They did advocate not using grains as a staple, but considered them a part of the diet. </p>

<p>THese days paleo is basically synonymous with keto . . . which is insane for long term diet</p>

<p>Assuming you have type 2, this is because keto hides the problem while continuing to make it worse. Your blood sugar is low but your insulin sensitivity remains terrible.  The goal should be to reverse the damage that has been done so that you can tolerate carbs again.</p>

<p>When has that ever been cited? I studied this somewhat extensively in college and never once heard that suggested. The advent of agriculture was the era of burgeoning sedentism, but we knew they were already eating it. As the article says:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Although earlier studies found evidence that Neanderthals ate grasses and tubers and cooked barley, the new study indicates they ate so much starch that it dramatically altered the composition of their oral microbiomes. “This pushes the importance of starch in the diet further back in time,” to when human brains were still expanding, Warinner says.</p>

<div class="md"><p>I have no idea what you are trying to say. Your conclusion is there were selective pressures against experimental thinking, but they clearly were highly selected for. Or at least in conjunction with social information sharing. Its pretty easy to find out things can be unsafe to eat after seeing one person deal with diarrhea or poisoning. That&#39;s a like once in 3 generation thing to learn which means communal knowledge would protect against local inedible items before it has a chance for any selection except the most brazen and starving. Proliferation of brazen people is because it was more fit, but that means it made them less likely to die so the likely hood it was frequently fatal is basically impossible</p>

<div class="md"><p>No one though they weren&#39;t eating them. But it was believed it wasn&#39;t the majority of the diet. The logic was that plants back then were very hard to eat, and had limited amount of calories, and we&#39;ve seriously modified them since them with artificial selection. Before agriculture collecting a large amount of plants would require, in theory, time equivalent to hunting and trapping. So it&#39;d made sense we&#39;d eat less plants overall.</p>

<p>The article proves gives evidence to the contrary. And that makes sense too. (Proto) Humans probably started growing friendly plants near their areas probably very early, thousands of years before getting to a point we&#39;d call agriculture (tech advanced very quickly). Maybe growing is too much of a word, simply letting eatable plants be, while removing non-edible plants, promoting more edible plants near their area. Also while plants and hunting might take about the same time, plant gathering is a lot safer. Killing a beast is always a dangerous task, and even with traps, you don&#39;t know if the animal trapped is alive, or if other predators are nearby by the smell of the dead animal. Plants are safer and more convenient.</p>

<p>Traditionally, white bread was a prestige food that only the rich could afford. It had real advantages in terms of cleanliness, but unfortunately you also removed many nutrients. So ironically, the fancy rich people’s food was less healthy than what the average Joe got.</p>

<p>The same story happened in other regions with white rice. In the Edo period of Japan, rich city-dwellers became increasingly prone to malnutrition. It is said that this contributed to the popularity of soba noodles, which persists to this day. Soba is made from buckwheat, which is a very nutritious grain.</p>

<p>To me, this whole idea of the &quot;agricultural revolution&quot; is nonsense.</p>

<p>There never was any such thing. The revolution was not in understanding how plants worked or how to grow plants. That knowledge was developed gradually by humanity, IMHO.</p>

<p>The revolution was not in agriculture.</p>

<p>The revolution if there was one was societal, it was designing a society around growing a ton of food to make a ton of expendable soldiers, rather than designing a society around making sure everyone can live pleasantly and sustainably off of the land.</p>

<div class="md"><p>I agree for the most part. I definitely lean more towards the idea that most plant domestication was through unintentional selection bias e.g. picking -&gt; eating -&gt; propagating more desirable members of a species. But certainly people have understood how to manage their environments for quite a long time.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t know if I agree with the militaristic angle as a driving force behind greater food production. I&#39;d say, at least initially, a soldier class is more a consequence of social power and resource consolidation allowing for greater escalations of existing violence within and between communities.</p>

<p>When I took anthropology in college there was considerable time spent specifically on the level of development in between hunting/gathering and agriculture, which they termed &quot;horticultural&quot; and defined as the establishment of semi-permanent or seasonal housing and the cultivation of crops at a smaller scale, supplemented with foraging, fishing, and/or hunting depending on the environment.</p>

<p>This was presented as being the level of development exhibited by most extant pre-agricultural societies across the world with hunting/gathering being comparatively uncommon, and the class talked about how much research on those societies was used to inform ideas about how cultures and civilizations develop.</p>

<p>Now that was a while back and I&#39;m sure a lot of that &quot;research&quot; was tainted by colonialist and chauvinist perspectives so I don&#39;t know how accurate the narrative that class taught is or what the modern Anthropological consensus is on how useful looking at extant pre-agricultural societies is when it comes to trying to reconstruct how agriculture developed, but there definitely is a considerable bulk of (however useful) research on exactly that topic and I don&#39;t think it would be inaccurate to say that a large chunk of anthropology over the past couple of centuries has been on precisely that topic (with the obvious caveat that mountains of that research are tainted by chauvinism, racism, and colonialist perspectives).</p>

<div class="md"><p>Archaeology in south and south-central parts of India has found  several settlements where food consumption apparently consisted of agriculture, animal husbandry and hunting at the same time. The midden heaps discovered there have bones from domesticated animals like cattle, wild animals like deer and different sorts of grain and pulses. So it can be concluded that people were combining various methods of food production. In North India, there&#39;s a lot of evidence that they fished and hunted the rivers as well.</p>

<div class="md"><p>Well rice is rice. I don’t use anything fancy just whatever rice I have on me. 1:1.5 rice/water ratio, bring to boil, low simmer for 18ish minutes. I almost exclusively use black beans unless I don’t have them (I always do). Those I just drain out of the can and reheat on medium with a dash of olive oil, garlic salt, pepper, cumin, cayenne and chili flakes.</p>

<div class="md"><p>Depends where you get your rice. But yeah, if arsenic is a problem, you&#39;re better off with white rice.</p>

<p>You should also soak your rice overnight, then cook it in excess water like pasta and drain. This removes a lot of the arsenic.</p>

<p>As for glycemic load, interesting information, but the reasons that I have heard for brown rice being better for you is because most of the vitamins, minerals and fibre sits in the bran and germ. These are present in brown rice, but absent in white rice.</p>

<div class="md"><p>I feel like a paleo diet can work for losing weight like any other diet can - by restricting what types of food they eat, most people end up simply eating fewer calories. You’re cutting out the chips, pretzels, sodas, whatever, and most often not replacing them. Like you say, the meal prep is annoying on diets like that, so many people might end up eating less overall, skipping meals to save time. I think a lot of people think of eating tons of red meat and animal products when they think of paleo though, which would likely have a negative impact on your cholesterol, especially if you’re not changing other dietary habits and instead just choosing to hear that increasing your meat intake is good.</p>

<p>I’m not a dietician though and I have but two brain cells to smack together</p>

<div class="md"><p>That is not necessarily true. Your body produces uric acid (which crystalized causing the condition of gout) as well as getting it from food. Usually with enough liquid the body can get rid of the excess uric acid. However, some people&#39;s bodies can over produce this acid even with a near perfect diet. As was my case. So yes reducing red meats, wine, beer, and shellfish,  can help, but is not the only way to get gout. Also hydration matters a lot. My 2¢</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Significance</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The microbiome plays key roles in human health, but little is known about its evolution. We investigate the evolutionary history of the African hominid oral microbiome by analyzing dental biofilms of humans and Neanderthals spanning the past 100,000 years and comparing them with those of chimpanzees, gorillas, and howler monkeys. We identify 10 core bacterial genera that have been maintained within the human lineage and play key biofilm structural roles. However, many remain understudied and unnamed. We find major taxonomic and functional differences between the oral microbiomes of Homo and chimpanzees but a high degree of similarity between Neanderthals and modern humans, including an apparent Homo-specific acquisition of starch digestion capability in oral streptococci, suggesting microbial coadaptation with host diet.</p>

<p>Abstract</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The oral microbiome plays key roles in human biology, health, and disease, but little is known about the global diversity, variation, or evolution of this microbial community. To better understand the evolution and changing ecology of the human oral microbiome, we analyzed 124 dental biofilm metagenomes from humans, including Neanderthals and Late Pleistocene to present-day modern humans, chimpanzees, and gorillas, as well as New World howler monkeys for comparison. We find that a core microbiome of primarily biofilm structural taxa has been maintained throughout African hominid evolution, and these microbial groups are also shared with howler monkeys, suggesting that they have been important oral members since before the catarrhine–platyrrhine split ca. 40 Mya. However, community structure and individual microbial phylogenies do not closely reflect host relationships, and the dental biofilms of Homo and chimpanzees are distinguished by major taxonomic and functional differences. Reconstructing oral metagenomes from up to 100 thousand years ago, we show that the microbial profiles of both Neanderthals and modern humans are highly similar, sharing functional adaptations in nutrient metabolism. These include an apparent Homo-specific acquisition of salivary amylase-binding capability by oral streptococci, suggesting microbial coadaptation with host diet. We additionally find evidence of shared genetic diversity in the oral bacteria of Neanderthal and Upper Paleolithic modern humans that is not observed in later modern human populations. Differences in the oral microbiomes of African hominids provide insights into human evolution, the ancestral state of the human microbiome, and a temporal framework for understanding microbial health and disease.</p>

<div class="md"><p>Correct! Some kinds of bacteria are able to basically hibernate in a form called an endospore- which is very hard to destroy- until the time that the environment is optimal for the bacteria to colonize. This is why one should be very careful about temperature controls on leftover rice- cooking rice is too hot for the spores of the particular bacteria that is commonly present in spore form in rice to activate, and refrigerator temperature is too cold. But if you leave cooked rice out long enough to get it room temperature and sit there for a bit (iirc about four hours, but don&#39;t take my word for it) the conditions become PERFECT. And you can get nasty food poisoning from your leftover fried rice take-out. Or your own home cooked rice that you didn&#39;t put away properly.</p>

<div class="md"><p>You&#39;re right, it really is up to them. The point is to let someone decide with the evidence if they want to choose to eat food that contributes to suffering and ecological breakdown or not. Just like it&#39;s someone&#39;s choice to not wear a seatbelt or a face mask or get a vaccine. Providing evidence is not the same as telling people what to do, it&#39;s more of an intelligence test than a command.</p>

<p>Regardless of personal belief there is evidence of the reality in each of these situations. If someone chooses to ignore the facts and contribute to harm, that&#39;s their choice. You are right, it is their choice. Imagine if we held this attitude toward other morally reprehensible actions. Why don&#39;t we tolerate choices to harm others when it comes to people or pets, but ignore it when it comes to other sentient, suffering animals? (hint: speciesism and carnism)</p>

<div class="md"><p>You gain weight because you eat a lot. There’s nothing in grains and starches that makes you magically gain weight. It doesn’t work that way. I’ve lost like 50 kgs without food genocide.</p>

<p>If you fart from certain foods, look at FODMAP sources and try to eliminate them one product by one. If you have acid reflux and IBS, that’s how your particular organism works, and it has nothing to do with ancient people.</p>

<p>What I’m saying is that there’s no magic in paleo, there’s no evidence that ancient people were healthier at all, that they have eaten in a certain way, and there no need to discriminate whole groups of foods to be healthier. However, it’s not easy to create a balanced diet plan, so people usually take one and follow it, be it paleo, carnivore, vegan, pescatarian etc. All as one claim that this particular diet helped them to lose weight and is a silver bullet. But there’s no magic.</p>

<p>I do not understand the sort of pushback of a sense of &#39;haha looks like paleo people won&#39;t like this&#39; (which I believe is a paraphrase of a popular comment in this thread).  I guess I get some sense that people like myself, who believe the diet to be very healthy for almost all people, are viewed as antagonists to a more &#39;mainstream culture&#39;, yet the antagonism seems unwarranted, and because it seems unwarranted it seems artificial, and because it seems artificial it seems planned to some degree.</p>

<p>There&#39;s a reason why potatoes, rice, bread and chips taste awesome. We needed to eat those things to survive, and if we evolved to eat only meats everything else would taste like dogshit right now. Our sense of smell and taste literally evolved to direct us to prefer highly nutritious foods. Nature ain&#39;t dumb</p>

<div class="md"><p>No, Africans didn’t stop changing. Fist Homo Sapiences were black, but they were not those black people we know now. Green eyes and brown hair were more common for example. <a href="http://antropogenez.ru/uploads/tx_antropedia/k14-2.jpg">Features are “guessable”</a> but not what we see today. Races never stopped or froze, they kept changing no matter what and will keep changing. Black people remained black not because they never mated with Neanderthals, they remained black because skin cancer and the Sun thing. Africans changed on their own, Europeans changed on their own. A lot of Asian people have Denisovan people mixed with them, another species of humans that lived along Sapiences and Neanderthals.</p>

<div class="md"><p>Hm, I guess by definition, yes? If you want to get technical then you could consider Africans more &quot;human&quot; than other races.</p>

<p>Obviously though that doesn&#39;t hold up scientifically since no human ethnicity is genetically distinct enough to be considered a separate species or more &quot;evolved&quot; than another. It may happen sometime in the future but currently not now. There is only one human race, homo sapiens sapiens, which is us.</p>

<div class="md"><p>The split happened some 500,000 years ago and was substantial enough to lead to identifiably different DNA and appearance. Denisovans also split off and happen to be more closely related to Neanderthals  with interbreeding that occured with Austronesians.</p>

<p>Hybridization is an interesting concept in evolutionary biology. Different species that are closely related and cohabitate space might end up interbreeding. Called hybrid zone. Depending on the circumstances, the species may continue to remain separate (reinforcement), or become one species again (reconnection). You might end up with 3 species when the hybrids end up forming their own species.</p>

<p>We&#39;ve found some bone fragments that were amazingly cool. It was from a 13-yr-ish girl that lived 50k years ago and had a Neanderthal mother and a Denisovan father. She was the product of hybridization. The DNA of the Denisovan father showed that there a bit of interbreeding with Neanderthals in his past, too.</p>

<p>The article had this to say “The DNA of Neanderthals and Denisovans are distinct. We can easily tell them apart. That argues against frequent interbreeding. Otherwise they would have ended up with the same DNA.”</p>
