Have I hit ketosis??

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>So I&#39;ve doing keto for about a week. I was over weight by a solid 20-30 LBS and started to notice a difference even day two, which I assumed was a lot of water weight. Well today I&#39;ve seen the biggest difference. My bloated belly has dropped down a lot, I can see a few more weeks of this and a heavy fast or two will bring back out my hidden abs
 I was curious though....Today I feel almost light headed. Almost. It feels more like I smoked a fat blunt and I&#39;m high asf. My body is sore from working out I feel a little weaker and lethargic but still able to operate and I feel physically healthy outside of that....is that ketosis?</p>

<div class="md"><p>￼ ￼Did you read the FAQ? </p>

<p><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/keto/wiki/faq">https://www.reddit.com/r/keto/wiki/faq</a></p>

<p>Are you getting 5000mg sodium, 1000-3500mg potassium, and 500mg bioavailable magnesium daily?</p>

<p>If the answer is “I don’t know how many mg I am getting,” start tracking it.</p>

<p>Buy salt and salt substitute in the grocery store. You don’t need any fancy products or pills for sodium and potassium. Magnesium glycinate is very cheap on amazon to boot.</p>

<p>The keto flu is nothing more than electrolyte deficiency. It can happen anytime you are deficient, not just at the start.</p>

<div class="md"><p>Electrolytes and water. Try miso, bone broth, salt your food, and don’t worry about getting too much. You’re not gonna break anything in a week. Eat more fat, stop working out for a few days and walk, drink lots of water, and be patient. You may be in ketosis, but it takes a few weeks for your body to be able to switch to the new fuel source. You’ll lose a few pounds yes, water. After that, stop watching the scale and measure your waist once a month.</p>

<div class="md"><p>The woozy feelings all sound like keto flu, which is avoidable/curable easily.</p>

<p>Have you read the section in the FAQ about electrolytes?</p>

<p>Sore after working out might improve with electrolytes, or it might take you 4-8 weeks to get fat adapted for activity.</p>

<div class="md"><p>Yeah I&#39;ve seen some things about electrolytes I&#39;ll get something to help with those. </p>

<p>Well even if it&#39;s keto flu at least I know I&#39;m doing things right so far lmao. I just got vitamins. Magnesium and fish oil. Anything else recommended?</p>

<div class="md"><p>Sodium and potassium. Using a 50/50 salt like Morton&#39;s Lite salt liberally on the food you eat will help and might be all you need for those. You also might need to add drinking some &quot;keto-ade&quot; through the day. ESPECIALLY when you workout. To avoid crashing during a workout, I have to nearly continually replenish water and electrolytes like it&#39;s my job.</p>

<div class="md"><p>Gotchya. Good to know. So even with a balanced diet replenishing electrolytes is big.</p>

<div class="md"><p>Extremely.</p>

<p>And it always will be on keto. Electrolyte imbalance can happen any time on keto. For me specifically, I usually get painful charlie horses at night as the signal I&#39;m out of whack. But everyone gets different symptoms.</p>
