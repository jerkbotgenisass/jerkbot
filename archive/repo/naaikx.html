Trying to get back to a proper diet for working out, looking for insight

<p><a href="https://i.imgur.com/AXeLIuf.png">https://i.imgur.com/AXeLIuf.png</a> &lt; --- my current diet, which meets or comes close to all of my macro nutrients, but is, I suspect, very unbalanced. I listed my TDEE calculations beneath it, but just in case:  </p>

<p>2064 calories per day</p>

<p>160 pounds<br/>
28 M<br/>
I do the basic BWF routine ( 3X8 pushups, dips, rows, etc) daily, and walk 20-30 minutes per day.<br/>
Trying to get back down to 145 and regain lost muscle.  </p>

<p>I&#39;m mostly here because the above diet, while delicious, doesn&#39;t seem like it&#39;s actually a good idea, despite hitting my macros. I&#39;m looking for other cheap, easy to prepare foods to weave in to prevent health issues without exceeding my calorie count or missing out on macros.</p>

<div class="md"><p>Don’t know if this will get me downvoted or not - but you gotta eat real food, my dude. Pizza for breakfast? And then two shakes for lunch and dinner? Meeting your macros is important, but so is the quality and variety of what you put into your body. You’re not getting in any vitamins or minerals - deficiencies in those have very real consequences against your goals. </p>

<p>You need veggies. You need fiber. You need healthy fats. I don’t care what anyone else here says - your life and health aren’t just about the immediate fitness goals - the next 28 years of your life will depend on a balanced diet as much as it does on macros.</p>

<p>Make rice bowls, burritos, protein-rich soups - all of this can be made in bulk and frozen. All bring a great deal of variety and balance to your diet.</p>

<div class="md"><p>You are right. Variety and balance also brings satiety. It sucks to be hungry all the time and for me, eating crappy means I&#39;m going to be hungry later, even if I shoehorn the crappy food into my calorie count for the day.</p>

<div class="md"><p>Get into meal prepping. It seriously makes a huge difference. </p>

<p>Pick a few go-to dishes that you can cook in bulk, portion out, and freeze.</p>

<p>Cooking in bulk will help keep your food costs per meal down. And you just grab a meal out of the freezer so there&#39;s very little time spent thinking about what to eat. The other bonus is minimal washing of dishes during the week.</p>

<p>On the the food you&#39;ve included there... It&#39;s mostly shakes and a lot of sugar from milk. Try to get your carbs from vegetables instead. Complex carbs are probably best and will get you some fiber as well.</p>

<div class="md"><p>It&#39;s a bit on the high end but nothing outrageous! Ultimately everyone has a different optimal amount of protein for whatever goal they have. And it depends on your size too-- 160g to someone like 6&#39;2&quot; is different than someone who&#39;s 5&#39;2&quot;.</p>

<div class="md"><p>This us not scientifically accurate, something is missing here. If you were building muscles on a vigorous regime then you would need around 90grams of protein per day, this is assuming hou work out for an hour a day. Protein is important, but people mis-measure its daily intake due to unit difference or sometimes due to being hyped by getting jacked in a short time.

<div class="md"><p>My advice would be to start with small changes. It might be hard to jump to a brand new diet for you. Maybe pick one easy change for a week and then one the next. I think you might need less protein than you think (I eat 120g/day as my min). But even with 160, you can diversify a lot! Try an hit some foods with solid protein (10g/100cal) and you can add whatever extra calories you want. </p>

<p>Some ideas:</p>

<ul>
<li>Chicken breast, shredded, with mexican seasoning. Good flavor with high protein and low cal. Serve on corn tortillas or lo-carb tortillas. Shredded cabbage. Top with non-fat greek yogurt blended with lime juice, a bit of avocado, a jalepeno, and cilatnro. Super low cal high protein sauce. &lt;--- I could eat this every day with no flavor fatigue.</li>
<li>Non-fat greek yogurt with a small amount of a high-protein cereal for some crunch. </li>
<li>Eggs. But honestly, I eat way less than I could.</li>
<li>Beef Jerky. Great high protein snack!</li>
<li>Protein pancake, no-sugar syrup, non-fat greek yogurt, a few blueberries &lt;---  my #1 go to breakfast!</li>
<li>High protein TV dinners. This is my new go to for lunch. You can get a ~200 cal 20g protein meal for $2. </li>
<li>Turkey chili or turkey meat tacos. Ground beef is actually fine too if you chop it up and drain the fat (you get a lot of fat loss when you drain! dont use packaging defaults if you cook it this way!).</li>
<li>Halo top for dessert! Chocolate Mocha flavor wins hands down for me.</li>
<li>Protein waffles with pb2. (I found I dont love the protein waffles though :( )</li>
<li>Chick-fil-a nuggets!</li>
<li>Pork shoulder or brisket on the smoker makes pretty lean meat for a week. </li>
<li>Protein noodles with parm cheese</li>
<li>Cashew milk over regular milk. I sometimes make a &quot;shake&quot; with real milk, protein scoop, and ice - but I consider that a treat!</li>
</ul>

<p>&#x200B;</p>

<p>Again, don&#39;t do these all at once! But start adding some diversity. You will decrease your flavor fatigue an increase your micronutrients with more diversity.</p>

<div class="md"><p>I use Krusteaz Buttermilk Protein Pancake and Waffle mix for my breakfasts. I add one egg to the recipe. 220cal / 15g protein on the pancake. Egg adds 70cal/6g for a total of 290cal/21g protein. The eggo type frozen waffles are Kodiak Cakes Power Waffles. 240cal/12g - medium cal, but a good treat.  </p>

<p>Kashi &quot;GoLean&quot; cereal. They range from like 180cal-240cal and 10-14g protein per serving depending on the flavor. The peanut butter one is amazing. I consider 10g protein per 100 cal to be high protein, 5g/100cal to be medium, so this is somewhere in between that for most flavors. If I eat a handful of handful of high and medium each day I can fit in 2-400 calories of anything I want (beer).</p>

<div class="md"><p>srsly you know this already man.  Pizza is quite high in sodium and processed everything.  It&#39;s a treat, not a regular meal.</p>

<p>You need veggies for vitamins and fiber, not just carbs.  Nutritious carbs are also found in whole grains and fruit.</p>

<p>Protein shakes aren&#39;t really food.  Eat some dang food.  Protein comes in meat, fish, eggs, legumes, and nuts.  </p>

<p>for the cost of a couple of those pizzas you could get a big pack of ground beef and a few sacks of frozen broccoli and have like four meals.  Take a guess which is gonna lead to a better body.</p>

<div class="md"><p>Lots of fat and cholesterol in what you&#39;ve posted there.</p>

<p>Not pushing, but maybe take a look at plant based diets too.</p>

<div class="md"><p>You&#39;re not pushing! The pizza was on there primarily because I had entirely forgotten that vegetables were a good source of carbs. My brain associated carbs with bread, and therefore things like hamburgers, pizza, etc.  </p>

<p>Carrots and peanut butter is WAY better for me, and just as yummy xD</p>

<div class="md"><p>You&#39;re drinking protein shakes for meals? What the fuck?! </p>

<p>A protein shake isn&#39;t a meal. It&#39;s literally just milk with added protein. You&#39;re literally drinking milk as your diet. With some pizza for breakfast. That&#39;s it? Are you serious? This is by far the most absurd thing I&#39;ve seen in my life. OP, answer me this and answer seriously. Are you a retard?</p>

<div class="md"><p>The strength increase I got with that diet (plus an extra half a pizza and 1-2 TV dinners a day) speaks for itself. I went from 140 and unable to do a single pullup to doing 6 pullups in like half a year.  </p>

<p>Gotta love that dirty bulk. Terrible diet to stay on once my workouts slowed down.</p>

<p>Noob gains come no matter what you eat. You would have been able to do the same with a deficit and 0.4 g/lb protein.</p>
