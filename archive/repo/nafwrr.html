<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Currently  I just do some bare minimum light exercise (light walking, light  stationary cycling) to keep joints healthy (bad knees). I&#39;m trying to  lose weight someday and get abs. I&#39;m trying to figure out if doing ab  exercises will ever be needed to get aesthetically pleasing looking abs or if getting low body percent then small amounts of liposuction for touchups will be good enough </p>

<p>Mainly,  I am trying to avoid accidentally making obliques bigger or becoming  sore (I would rather have slightly slower progress than be sore). I used to be into building muscle but my personal experience was that I was much happier w/ less muscle and no soreness </p>

<p>Current plan is to maybe do one or two crunches per day in case some kind of exercise is needed, not sure how to tweak things to get the best daily amount without getting sore</p>

<div class="md"><p>Don’t want to get sore but you’re willing to do a crunch or two a day?? Slow down, focus on form with a quarter crunch at first and get the form correct</p>

<div class="md"><p>To get a six-pack, you’ll have to work your abdominals.  You might get a couple abs showing with diet and minimal effort, but for the whole experience you’ll need to put in the effort.  And get sore.  And maybe - gods forbid - sweaty.</p>
