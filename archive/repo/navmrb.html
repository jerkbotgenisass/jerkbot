<div class="md"><p>Really great tutorial, the informations are great.</p>

<p>I really like the routines.</p>

<p>Maybe, you should have added which muscles are worked for each movement, but this is minor.</p>

<p>I also really like the edit of the video.</p>

<p>Keep going !</p>

<div class="md"><p>Thank you very much for the feedback! Stating which muscles are primarily used for each movement wouldâ€™ve been helpful for those who want to work out more on specific parts. It is a fun way to move and I am happy you enjoyed it.</p>

<div class="md"><p>Great video, I would like to add this video from The Bioneer to add onto this discussion. I think animal flow is a great source of full body workouts that a lot of people disregard.  </p>

<div class="md"><p>That is also a very good video about the benefits and good information. It is some thing I have definitely enjoyed to do as cross training for other bodyweight sports. Thank you for giving it a watch and for providing feedback.</p>
