Was eating ground beef burgers and had a feeling of "gratefulness" that emerged in me.

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>It was so weird. I just forced myself to cook a pound of ground beef into burgers instead of ordering some junk food and as I was eating it, a feeling of gratitude just popped up into my body and mind as I looked at the ground beef burger. This past weekend and earlier today I ate a lot of junk food and alcohol after being strict before.</p>

<p>So interesting how feelings of spirituality can be activated by nutritious beef.</p>

<p>I also remember when in the first month of going carnivore, and eating a lot of meat for dinner (at the time that was new to me) I felt <strong>literally high</strong>.</p>

<p>I&#39;ve done my fair share of drugs and when I say literally high, I was literally high. I wasn&#39;t on any drugs at the time, just a very pleasant &quot;clean&quot; euphoric body high was washing over me as I sat on the couch noticing it after eating a bunch of meat.</p>

<p>That doesn&#39;t happen after eating spinach or french fries!</p>

<div class="md"><p>I get this head sensation, like a pleasant headache (same areas) and I do feel &quot;high&quot; too, best way I can describe it too. Anyone have insight on this?</p>
