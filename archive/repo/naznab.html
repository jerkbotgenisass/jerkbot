<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Start this by saying I’ve been training around 10/11 months. Currently bulking up. </p>

<p>Was considering to run a Dbol + Test course until I came across MK677. It sounds a lot better fit and the side effects seem much more mild. </p>

<p>Looking for opinions on whether really, will it have much of an impact etc? </p>

<p>Thanks</p>

<div class="md"><p>Hahahaha wtf? Plateaud after 11 months of lifting? Bro if u wanna do PEDs go ahead. But you don&#39;t know shit about lifting and eating and everything u need to know. Not that there&#39;s anything wrong with not knowing, but you don&#39;t need PEDs. You need knowledge on how to train and eat etc.</p>

<div class="md"><p>Everyone grows a lot in the first 3 months to a year. That’s why they call it newbie gains and why you always hear seasoned lifters always still amazed by it.</p>

<p>Your progress has slowed likely because you need to improve your diet and training as well, which must be improved before you start PEDs. </p>

<p>Do not run Dbol and Test as a first cycle. If you’re going to run gear, just run Test alone so you know what types of side effects you run into... if you’re a high aromatizer, don’t run dbol after you figure that out lol</p>

<p>Where are your big 3 lifts at for 1RM, what are your body stats?</p>

<div class="md"><p>Lol you should workout for like 4 or 5 more years before taking anything and I&#39;m going to let you know You definitely didn&#39;t plateau around 3 months you have barely hit your noobie gains yet. </p>

<p>It&#39;s your choice to take whatever but all your going to do of fuck yourself up for the future</p>

<div class="md"><p>I agree with everything the others said about you needing to loft longer before doing PED&#39;s, but how do you go from a test/dbol stack to mk lol. Kind of feel like this post is bait</p>

<div class="md"><p>No not bait. Just to clarify I’m not planning on taking anyyrhinf for the foreseeable future. I want to stay natural for as long as possible just planning for the future and want more info on MK677.</p>

<p>Looks good to me as seems there’s little side effects</p>

<div class="md"><p>Mk-677 doesn’t really do much in the sense of direct muscle gain. Just makes you eat better, sleep better and recover better. Basically set you up for muscle gain. It’s odd how you went from dbol and test to mk-677.. also I wouldn’t bother touching anything for at least another 4 years. You would have 5 years of training behind you and you’ll be 25 as well. Still young, mk-677 would be pointless due to your levels being high anyway</p>

<div class="md"><p>Mk677 isn&#39;t side affect free. It also messes with prolactin. Don&#39;t believe the hype on the alleged gains you&#39;ll make just from anything that increases GH.</p>

<p>As prementioned it&#39;s not going to be anywhere near test and dbol. I&#39;d personally try and get Tbol if you can as the estrogen and water retention from dbol can be an issue.</p>

<p>I fell for the hype with mk677 igf and sarms. You&#39;re never going to beat good old scientifically backed anabolics</p>

<div class="md"><p>You seem sorta new to this whole thing. First of all, Dbol and Test is probably overkill for your first cycle. And second of all, anabolic steroids/SARMS work completely differently than MK677. MK677 will boost GH/IGF-1 secretion, two hormones completely unrelated to anything an anabolic steroid will touch. MK677 is so drastically different both in terms of side effects and it&#39;s mechanism of action that you can&#39;t argue that it will substitute for Dbol or Test. MK677 is more comparable to a low dose of pharma grade HGH. People target GH/IGF-1 secretion for it&#39;s benefits on skin, hair, recovery, favorable body composition, etc. With that said, it doesn&#39;t work as drastically as a steroid or a SARM works. As far as sides, Dbol and Test require PCT to allow yourself to produce hormones normally again. MK677 won&#39;t require such a process because it doesn&#39;t mess with your natural hormone production. However, MK677 will not produce the anywhere near same results as Dbol and Test. My suggestion is to educate yourself. It hurts me to see people who lift for 10/11 months and genuinely believe they have plateaud permanently and thus need juice. Don&#39;t kid yourself. If you want to speed up your progress, at least be honest with yourself and DO YOUR RESEARCH before you put anything in your body.</p>
