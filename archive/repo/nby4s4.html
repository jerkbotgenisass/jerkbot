<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>He has 3 categories which he calls the warrior Greek god and superhero physique. Even the lowest category the warrior looks like it is impossible for a natty lifter. For me as a 65kg guy I would have to be able to Ohp 45kg 5 reps Incline bench 70kg 5 reps Weighted chin ups with 20kg for 5 reps squat 100kg for 5 reps and deadlift 110kg for 5 reps. And obviously I would be low bf 8-10.</p>

<div class="md"><p>Well all those lifts are attainable ...might take a while but you could do it. I wouldn’t spend money on that program because he’s an idiot but do as you wish..</p>

<div class="md"><p>I don’t believe in spending money on a program when there’s plenty of proven programs out there for free. I’ll want to just apply his philosophy of relative strength but I’m not sure if it can be done</p>

<div class="md"><p>I actually bought his warrior shred program 3 years ago and was the first ever fitness program I had used. It was simple and straightforward, which was great for getting me started— and I am so glad I did. Could you get better programs? -absolutely. But it was great for introducing me to more structure and direction in my fitness journey.</p>

<div class="md"><p>I actually use those strength standards as goals as I think they’re fairly attainable for me. </p>

<p>I know a lot of people hate on him because he’s a douche but his programs do give people some good results.</p>

<div class="md"><p>Those lifts are easily attainable with a bit of patience.</p>

<p>How about you look at the Leangains programme, where Kinobody stole all his ideas from? I mean, that&#39;s the sub you&#39;re in after all.</p>

<div class="md"><p>His lifting standard work really well when you consider he doesn&#39;t prescribe a lot of lower body work (if any at all).</p>

<p>The good thing about Kinobody and Martin is that they both tell you the truth in that you need to get stronger at the big compound lifts to build muscle. If you want muscle, you cannot avoid straining under the barbell.</p>

<div class="md"><p>If this seems impossible, you really need to up your standards. Those are very attainable numbers.</p>

<p>Also, you&#39;re 5&#39;10&quot; - a good idea for your physique would be to stop being a 65kg guy and be at least an 80kg guy instead.</p>
