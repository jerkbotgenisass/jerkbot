<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Hey guys! Long time lurker here and decided it was time to give back to the community that has given me such good advice. I’m sure we’ve noticed the influx of fake natties and their apologists talking about how none of us lift. </p>

<p>I don’t know about you guys but that kind of pisses me off. We all know what’s up and what the average person can do. So I thought it would be great if we could make a resource that people could look to to set reasonable goals for themselves.  </p>

<p>So I put together a survey to do just that! Let’s show people what they can expect without using steroids and prove these assholes wrong!</p>

<p>I hope the mods are ok with me doing this. I’ll collect the results in two weeks and make some graphs to visually represent the results! Enjoy your weekend everyone!</p>
