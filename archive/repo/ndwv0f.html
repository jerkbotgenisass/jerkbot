Do I HAVE to use technique?

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Have a background in a lot of different martial arts (not good at any of them I just love tinkering with ideas and techniques) and I’ve been studying sports psychology as well as doing yoga, tai chi, and various “animal” type exercises in my backyard and on a tree. </p>

<p>climbing, swinging, crab walking stuff like that. already seeing great results and feel more “in tune” and in control of my body. Anyways I’m ranting but I’m getting to the point I promise. Because of this last time I rolled I started moving without technique I wasn’t really doing anything that had a name I was just kind of moving my body in ways to defend and confuse my opponent. It was very instinctual like a white belt (which I am) but I felt stronger and like I was rolling with more gusto and tenacity, as if i knew BJJ but decided not to use it. </p>

<p>Guy I rolled with said I was “squirrelly” and he’s never seen anyone move like that. Anyone know if this is a thing or am I making it up? anyways I like it and I think I’m gonna start training more in it. I feel more conscious of my movements yet not at the same time it’s weird and I’m sorry if none of this post made sense</p>

<div class="md"><p>Are you training at a BJJ academy? Or training under someone who trains BJJ? Also yes you’re making it up in your head, and I’m almost positive you are not special. </p>

<p>Is your name Joshua Fabia by chance?</p>

<div class="md"><p>Considering you are new it would be better to learn the move as is with proper technique and then later on make things your own. Not saying you can’t just try random stuff and see what happens. I just feel it’s better to learn how to do the move as is and later on when your comfortable start changing it up with the ideas in mind.</p>
