As a former bodybuilder before the pandemic, I now view bodybuilding as cringe and pathetic

<div class="post">
<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I used to be fairly muscular. Like I was the ‚Äújacked‚Äù guy. I haven‚Äôt been to the gym in basically 14 months (since the gyms shutdown with lockdown). For the first two months I was worried about my gains and tried to do home workouts to replenish my muscle. Then I was like ‚Äúscrew it‚Äù and began grinding it for a second degree and my career.</p>

<p>Honestly I laugh at the whole concept of it now. The way I‚Äôd routinely go the gym for 90 minutes, 5 days a week (no matter what, even during exams), as if people were seriously going to care about how puffed my chest was save for when they‚Äôre horny or if we‚Äôre at the beach (which incidentally I live hundreds of miles away from). I laugh at how much stress I‚Äôd feel on the rare occasions that I‚Äôd miss a workout, or how I‚Äôd always be worried about gaining fat during my bulking season. Or carrying a food scale everywhere I go to track my calories. I wanted to do steroids so badly and would fantasize about getting juiced. I wasn‚Äôt even doing it for girls; I just liked the attention and dominance (which ironically enough waned the buffer I got).  </p>

<p>Looking back, I cringe at how dedicated I was to this. Like I‚Äôm actually embarrassed by it. To be fair though I‚Äôll probably end up getting back into it once I‚Äôm in a more stable position in my life career and financial wise, but it‚Äôs amazing how one‚Äôs priorities change.</p>

<div class="md"><p>Wow, this is a pretty honest self-assessment. I hope you&#39;re cool with yourself and all but I think you should be proud at your ability to have varying perspectives. Not about body building specifically but being able to unbiasedly look at yourself; seems like you wouldn&#39;t get deluded into something like a drug addiction or be in some denial in the future, and that&#39;s a strength in itself.</p>

<p>Anyway the honesty was refreshing on this sub that&#39;s so polluted with mediocrity. Don&#39;t kick yourself too hard over it; you&#39;re cool.</p>

<div class="md"><p>Totally.  I read that (it‚Äôs below) and even though I‚Äôm not a body builder, just an old guy trying to not be an embarrassment, I know exactly what weight I was benching pre-Covid.  No food scale, no dreams of roids, no creatine or whey powder.  Tbf I did go in 10 lb increments, adding 5s on each side and just going fewer reps.  But gym guys know their weight number, especially bench, and certainly count plates for squats, just like (most) girls know their pants/dress size and can remember exactly what it used to be.</p>

<div class="md"><p>From the sounds of it you weren‚Äôt really a bodybuilder, you were just some dude who lifted weights. Have you ever competed? What were your stats? What were your lifts?</p>

<p>I personally think it sounds funny when people say they‚Äôre a bodybuilder just because they‚Äôve lifted some weights. It‚Äôs like when someone goes to boxing classes for a few months and say they‚Äôre a boxer even though they‚Äôve never stepped in the ring lol.</p>

<p>It‚Äôs definitely good to prioritise though. I go to the gym a lot but my life‚Äôs already stable and sorted, I‚Äôve got a good job, good relationship, plenty of money. If you‚Äôre still in college and think that committing to lifting would affect your chances of success then you should definitely skip lifting and focus on your degree.</p>

<div class="md"><p>Let&#39;s be real. OP likely set foot in a gym once before leaving and never returning. Just a few ridiculous things said by OP (the wording is honestly weird as fuck):</p>

<blockquote>
<p>replenish my muscle</p>

<p>how puffed my chest was</p>

<p>carrying a food scale everywhere I go to track my calories</p>

<p>fantasize about getting juiced.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Does this sound like a bodybuilder? Or does it sound like someone that thinks a 320 deadlift is on par with a 270 bench because they&#39;ve never actually made a long term commitment to going to the gym?</p>

<p>As for his lifts not being on par with each other it would be cheeky of me to comment on that as mine are too haha. There‚Äôs a video of me on this profile benching 140kg (308lbs) for reps and that was while fatigued yet I only squat 120kg (264lbs).</p>

<div class="md"><p>Yeah, it&#39;s not so much whether those lifts are realistic (most people probably bench more than they dl or squat simply because they don&#39;t dl or squat). It&#39;s just how he said it I guess. Then there&#39;s:</p>

<p>At several stages I would often de load (especially for squats) to get a better range of motion for my reps.</p>

<p>You really shouldn&#39;t have to periodically deload specifically to get yourself to stop squatting high. That&#39;s not why people deload.</p>

<p>Well before today I&#39;d have agreed with you, but according to the people in this thread anyone who has ever attempted to build muscle and lose fat (almost everyone in the Western world) classes as a bodybuilder.</p>

<p>My mum goes to spinning class and boxercise, I&#39;ll let her know that she should now introduce herself as a bodybuilder.</p>

<div class="md"><p>For deadlifts, I started off with shoulder-width stance and slightly wider-than-shoulder-width grip. After about 2 years of this I switched to a shoulder-width stance and a wide-arm-grip. I did this for a few months before I injured my back during a workout. I had to stop deadlifts for a few weeks and then returned back to a shoulder-width grip. </p>

<p>My main shoulder workouts leaned towards barbell press (sitting down) and Arnold press, as well as dumbbell press. I did standing overhead shoulder press more as an auxiliary workout. I lifted up to 70 lbs but I deloaded back down to 40 lbs to get a better range of motion.</p>

<p>For rhomboids, I really focused on T-bar rows and bent-over-barbell rows. During my deadlifts, I would initially squeeze my back during the lifts, but later stopped (it actually works your traps better if you do it naturally).</p>

<p>I started off with a typical program on bodybuilding.com, but over the course of 4 years, I would frequently modify and tweak it based on my needs. I also made sure to switch up my routines every 3-4 months (after a few years I‚Äôd have to switch it up more frequently, like every 2 months, due to plateaus).</p>

<div class="md"><p>Bro you don&#39;t have to compete in &quot;professional&quot; bodybuilding to be a bodybuilder.  Plenty of amateurs out there who compete at local/regional shows just for the love of the sport.  </p>

<p>Lifting, taking supplements/gear and not competing does not classify one as a bodybuilder.  It also doesn&#39;t make you &quot;less than&quot; an actual bodybuilder.  I support the gatekeeping of the term &quot;bodybuilder&quot; because it confuses the term for those of us who are actually dedicated to the sport.. who eat, sleep and breathe it.  Who sacrifice months of just feeling normal to get into contest shape.  That&#39;s what classifies one as a bodybuilder.  Just train for progress-sake and be happy.</p>

<div class="md"><p>Did you read the post mate?</p>

<p>This is the entire title of the post:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>As a former bodybuilder before the pandemic, I now view bodybuilding as cringe and pathetic</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Although lots of his post was dedicated to his own commitments we can&#39;t ignore the actual title. I&#39;ll also point out that one of the first rules of this sub is:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Your post must be an opinion. Not a question. Not a showerthought. Not a rant. Not a proposal. Not a fact. <strong>An opinion.

</blockquote>

<p>If OP somehow didn&#39;t mean that he viewed bodybuilding as cringe and pathetic then this post breaks the rules as that is the opinion posted in the post title.</p>

<p>To be a competing body builder maybe. But joe blow who is just as jacked is also a body builder even if he doesn&#39;t look bronze and pose.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>Which is the competing aspect. Similar to how those models still dress nice even if they aren&#39;t on the runway. Body builders can build without competing. Gatekeeping the term is the issue not the skill it take to be a pro.</p>

<p>Call it what you like body building by definition is</p>

<p>a sport involving strenuous physical exercise in order to strengthen and enlarge the muscles of the body.</p>

<p>Now that thats there can we agree on that definition?</p>

<p>Next, when you go throw a baseball with a friend or shoot hoops at a park you know you are engaging in the sport right? Do I have to be on a competing basketball team to be considered a basketball player? Even though I do it to the same caliber as most armature teams? No. Same for body building.</p>

<div class="md"><p>I found you can stick to the best available lifts on an upper/lower split twice a week for each so four total workouts, throw core in with lower body. 3 working sets for each muscle takes about 20 minutes. Use good form and still reap 80% of the benefits in less than 1/3 the of the time.</p>

<div class="md"><p>I sort of get your &#39;flip&#39; but I think you&#39;re probably an all or nothing type person, so your reaction to being unable was to pull a psychological trick akin to a child, &quot;Well I didn&#39;t want it anyway!&quot;</p>

<p>I don&#39;t really care if you ever set foot in a gym again. I&#39;ve had my own struggles to motivate myself to go back, knowing that I can&#39;t do what I once could and the whole theoretical track was entirely derailed. 
But to switch from enjoying something to mocking it is unusual to say the least. Perhaps it&#39;s a coping mechanism, rather than a genuine expression. If you do go back, maybe dial it down a bit. Just go for the maintenance of a normal healthy body rather than the fantasy of being huge.</p>

<div class="md"><p><strong>If we&#39;re to learn something from OP&#39;s post</strong>, we need to ask why his passion for bulking up finally outran all common sense.</p>

<p>His initial gym experience isn&#39;t unusual.  Looking good means different things to different people, but just about everyone puts at least a little time and effort into it.</p>

<p>The gym is particularly enticing because it also offers real health benefits.  Socializing at the gym may add to the experience.  If ditching the gym means ditching your friends, you keep at it, and the intensity and duration of the workout becomes a group decision.</p>

<p>But OP&#39;s focus was on gaining more respect from other men, and more attention from women.  At first, his efforts may have been rewarded to some extent.  After some point, there were no further rewards, and when he realized this, he reconsidered his priorities.  This is the classic Law of Diminishing Returns; just another facet of normal human behavior.</p>

<p>IMHO <strong>his competitive drive took him to extremes</strong>.  Rather than conform to any group workout behavior, and fit in, he was keen on outperforming and out-bulking not only his peer group in general, but even his fellow gym rats - and thereby gaining Dominance.</p>

<p><strong>The lesson here</strong>, then, is that acceptance and respect is a two-way street.  If you insist that your peers acknowledge you as their superior, you probably won&#39;t have much company.</p>

<div class="md"><p>I went through this exact same realization a couple years ago. Ever since high school I was &quot;the gym guy.&quot; As dedicated as someone could be. Read all the books, countless hours watching training videos on YouTube, idolized pro bodybuilders and powerlifters, posted about it on social media, had training on my mind almost all day, competed in several powerlifting meets. Then at some point it all seemed idiotic to me and a huge waste of time. I used to want to be the strongest guy in the gym, now I don&#39;t give a shit and I think people who take it as seriously as I used to are pathetic.</p>

<p>There&#39;s a serious case of diminishing returns that comes into play after several years of training seriously (unless you want to hop on a cycle, which I didn&#39;t). I found myself busting my ass to pretty much stay where I was or maybe add 5 or 10 pounds to each lift per year, or get a minor setback like an injury and then make zero progress for the year. It no longer was worth the time, energy, money spent on food an supplements, or the injuries. I was putting in way more than I was getting out of it, especially as I got older.</p>

<p>I still go to the gym for general health purposes, but I don&#39;t take it nearly as seriously as I used to. I spend way less time at the gym and it feels great. If I&#39;m not feeling my workout that day, I just leave. If I rather go enjoy the weather or meet up with friends, I&#39;ll skip the workout entirely because it doesn&#39;t fucking matter.</p>

<div class="md"><p>The weirdest part of bodybuilding imo is how time consuming it is for what it gets you. All those sacrifices and time spent at the gym only to get ‚Äúbigger‚Äù (which, as you said, only makes you more attractive up to a certain point). It‚Äôs a grind more than something enjoyable, and the payoff keeps getting smaller the more ripped you are.</p>

<p>I get wanting to look a certain way and maintaining that, but once you‚Äôre fairly muscular, no one cares about the slight increase you worked on for a year.</p>

<p>Even weirder is the ephemeral nature of it all. If your hobby is art, you know you‚Äôre putting something out for the world to enjoy, and that it will outlast you. Bodybuilding? You spend so much time working on your body (which is just like every other body out there, so zero novelty) and then you die and literally none of your work remains? The only impact of all that effort was giving you a body thousands also have?</p>

<p>I mean do as you wish but if bodybuilding is part of your personality you‚Äôre clearly boring as fuck, on the same level as people who put Netflix on their dating profile</p>

<p>carrying a food scale everywhere I go to track my calories</p>

<p>You really shouldn&#39;t have to periodically deload specifically to get yourself to stop squatting high. That&#39;s not why people deload.</p>

<div class="md"><p>For deadlifts, I started off with shoulder-width stance and slightly wider-than-shoulder-width grip. After about 2 years of this I switched to a shoulder-width stance and a wide-arm-grip. I did this for a few months before I injured my back during a workout. I had to stop deadlifts for a few weeks and then returned back to a shoulder-width grip. </p>

<p>My main shoulder workouts leaned towards barbell press (sitting down) and Arnold press, as well as dumbbell press. I did standing overhead shoulder press more as an auxiliary workout. I lifted up to 70 lbs but I deloaded back down to 40 lbs to get a better range of motion.</p>

<p>For rhomboids, I really focused on T-bar rows and bent-over-barbell rows. During my deadlifts, I would initially squeeze my back during the lifts, but later stopped (it actually works your traps better if you do it naturally).</p>

<p>I started off with a typical program on bodybuilding.com, but over the course of 4 years, I would frequently modify and tweak it based on my needs. I also made sure to switch up my routines every 3-4 months (after a few years I‚Äôd have to switch it up more frequently, like every 2 months, due to plateaus).</p>

<div class="md"><p>Bro you don&#39;t have to compete in &quot;professional&quot; bodybuilding to be a bodybuilder.  Plenty of amateurs out there who compete at local/regional shows just for the love of the sport.  </p>

<p>Lifting, taking supplements/gear and not competing does not classify one as a bodybuilder.  It also doesn&#39;t make you &quot;less than&quot; an actual bodybuilder.  I support the gatekeeping of the term &quot;bodybuilder&quot; because it confuses the term for those of us who are actually dedicated to the sport.. who eat, sleep and breathe it.  Who sacrifice months of just feeling normal to get into contest shape.  That&#39;s what classifies one as a bodybuilder.  Just train for progress-sake and be happy.</p>

<div class="md"><p>This needs to be higher up in this thread... everyone saying it&#39;s &quot;gatekeeping&quot;.. well, yeah it is.  </p>

<p>It&#39;s like everyone here thinks actual bodybuilders are saying that they are better than people who work out.  That&#39;s not what&#39;s going on.  Like you said, it&#39;s a sport.  Bodybuilders eat, sleep and breathe this... they sacrifice months of feeling like absolute dog shit to get into contest shape.. all for a single day on the stage.  We aren&#39;t better than you, we just ARE bodybuilders.. you just work out.  BTW you may train like a bodybuilder, eat like one, take the supps/gear like one - if that&#39;s the case, way to go bro that&#39;s something to be super proud of.

<p>This is the entire title of the post:</p>

<p>As a former bodybuilder before the pandemic, I now view bodybuilding as cringe and pathetic</p>

<p>Although lots of his post was dedicated to his own commitments we can&#39;t ignore the actual title. I&#39;ll also point out that one of the first rules of this sub is:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Your post must be an opinion. Not a question. Not a showerthought. Not a rant. Not a proposal. Not a fact. <strong>An opinion.

<p>If OP somehow didn&#39;t mean that he viewed bodybuilding as cringe and pathetic then this post breaks the rules as that is the opinion posted in the post title.</p>

<p>To be a competing body builder maybe. But joe blow who is just as jacked is also a body builder even if he doesn&#39;t look bronze and pose.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>Which is the competing aspect. Similar to how those models still dress nice even if they aren&#39;t on the runway. Body builders can build without competing. Gatekeeping the term is the issue not the skill it take to be a pro.</p>

<p>They may not sound different to the layman but body building implies participation in the actual sport and competition of body building. Anyone can be a weight lifter.</p>

<p>It‚Äôs just a matter of using up the wrong terms. No need to get defensive.</p>

<div class="md"><p>I&#39;m not defensive. I&#39;m calling out an asshole. </p>

<p>Call it what you like body building by definition is</p>

<p>a sport involving strenuous physical exercise in order to strengthen and enlarge the muscles of the body.</p>

<p>Now that thats there can we agree on that definition?</p>

<p>Next, when you go throw a baseball with a friend or shoot hoops at a park you know you are engaging in the sport right? Do I have to be on a competing basketball team to be considered a basketball player? Even though I do it to the same caliber as most armature teams? No. Same for body building.</p>

<p>You really shouldn&#39;t have to periodically deload specifically to get yourself to stop squatting high. That&#39;s not why people deload.</p>

<div class="md"><p>For deadlifts, I started off with shoulder-width stance and slightly wider-than-shoulder-width grip. After about 2 years of this I switched to a shoulder-width stance and a wide-arm-grip. I did this for a few months before I injured my back during a workout. I had to stop deadlifts for a few weeks and then returned back to a shoulder-width grip. </p>

<p>My main shoulder workouts leaned towards barbell press (sitting down) and Arnold press, as well as dumbbell press. I did standing overhead shoulder press more as an auxiliary workout. I lifted up to 70 lbs but I deloaded back down to 40 lbs to get a better range of motion.</p>

<p>For rhomboids, I really focused on T-bar rows and bent-over-barbell rows. During my deadlifts, I would initially squeeze my back during the lifts, but later stopped (it actually works your traps better if you do it naturally).</p>

<p>I started off with a typical program on bodybuilding.com, but over the course of 4 years, I would frequently modify and tweak it based on my needs. I also made sure to switch up my routines every 3-4 months (after a few years I‚Äôd have to switch it up more frequently, like every 2 months, due to plateaus).</p>

<div class="md"><p>Bro you don&#39;t have to compete in &quot;professional&quot; bodybuilding to be a bodybuilder.  Plenty of amateurs out there who compete at local/regional shows just for the love of the sport.  </p>

<p>Lifting, taking supplements/gear and not competing does not classify one as a bodybuilder.  It also doesn&#39;t make you &quot;less than&quot; an actual bodybuilder.  I support the gatekeeping of the term &quot;bodybuilder&quot; because it confuses the term for those of us who are actually dedicated to the sport.. who eat, sleep and breathe it.  Who sacrifice months of just feeling normal to get into contest shape.  That&#39;s what classifies one as a bodybuilder.  Just train for progress-sake and be happy.</p>

<p>It&#39;s like everyone here thinks actual bodybuilders are saying that they are better than people who work out.  That&#39;s not what&#39;s going on.  Like you said, it&#39;s a sport.  Bodybuilders eat, sleep and breathe this... they sacrifice months of feeling like absolute dog shit to get into contest shape.. all for a single day on the stage.  We aren&#39;t better than you, we just ARE bodybuilders.. you just work out.  BTW you may train like a bodybuilder, eat like one, take the supps/gear like one - if that&#39;s the case, way to go bro that&#39;s something to be super proud of.

<p>Although lots of his post was dedicated to his own commitments we can&#39;t ignore the actual title. I&#39;ll also point out that one of the first rules of this sub is:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>To be a competing body builder maybe. But joe blow who is just as jacked is also a body builder even if he doesn&#39;t look bronze and pose.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>Which is the competing aspect. Similar to how those models still dress nice even if they aren&#39;t on the runway. Body builders can build without competing. Gatekeeping the term is the issue not the skill it take to be a pro.</p>

<p>Call it what you like body building by definition is</p>

<p>a sport involving strenuous physical exercise in order to strengthen and enlarge the muscles of the body.</p>

<p>Now that thats there can we agree on that definition?</p>

<p>Next, when you go throw a baseball with a friend or shoot hoops at a park you know you are engaging in the sport right? Do I have to be on a competing basketball team to be considered a basketball player? Even though I do it to the same caliber as most armature teams? No. Same for body building.</p>

<div class="md"><p>Yeah, it&#39;s not so much whether those lifts are realistic (most people probably bench more than they dl or squat simply because they don&#39;t dl or squat). It&#39;s just how he said it I guess. Then there&#39;s:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>At several stages I would often de load (especially for squats) to get a better range of motion for my reps.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>You really shouldn&#39;t have to periodically deload specifically to get yourself to stop squatting high. That&#39;s not why people deload.</p>

<p>Well before today I&#39;d have agreed with you, but according to the people in this thread anyone who has ever attempted to build muscle and lose fat (almost everyone in the Western world) classes as a bodybuilder.</p>

<div class="md"><p>For deadlifts, I started off with shoulder-width stance and slightly wider-than-shoulder-width grip. After about 2 years of this I switched to a shoulder-width stance and a wide-arm-grip. I did this for a few months before I injured my back during a workout. I had to stop deadlifts for a few weeks and then returned back to a shoulder-width grip. </p>

<p>My main shoulder workouts leaned towards barbell press (sitting down) and Arnold press, as well as dumbbell press. I did standing overhead shoulder press more as an auxiliary workout. I lifted up to 70 lbs but I deloaded back down to 40 lbs to get a better range of motion.</p>

<p>For rhomboids, I really focused on T-bar rows and bent-over-barbell rows. During my deadlifts, I would initially squeeze my back during the lifts, but later stopped (it actually works your traps better if you do it naturally).</p>

<p>I started off with a typical program on bodybuilding.com, but over the course of 4 years, I would frequently modify and tweak it based on my needs. I also made sure to switch up my routines every 3-4 months (after a few years I‚Äôd have to switch it up more frequently, like every 2 months, due to plateaus).</p>

<p>Lifting, taking supplements/gear and not competing does not classify one as a bodybuilder.  It also doesn&#39;t make you &quot;less than&quot; an actual bodybuilder.  I support the gatekeeping of the term &quot;bodybuilder&quot; because it confuses the term for those of us who are actually dedicated to the sport.. who eat, sleep and breathe it.  Who sacrifice months of just feeling normal to get into contest shape.  That&#39;s what classifies one as a bodybuilder.  Just train for progress-sake and be happy.</p>

BTW you may train like a bodybuilder, eat like one, take the supps/gear like one - if that&#39;s the case, way to go bro that&#39;s something to be super proud of.  But you&#39;re still not a bodybuilder.</p>

<p>It would be like me playing football with my buddies and then telling people that I&#39;m a football player.</p>

<div class="md"><p>I‚Äôm not an authority of bodybuilding I just don‚Äôt think that it makes sense for someone who has average lifts, has never competed in any sort of bodybuilding competition and peaked at 180lbs, 5‚Äô11 10%bf to post his experience as a ‚Äúformer bodybuilder‚Äù.</p>

<p>Let‚Äôs be honest, when you think of a bodybuilder do you think of a dude who‚Äôs 5‚Äô11 and weighs 12 and a half stone with double digit bf%? Come on....</p>

<p>I‚Äôm fine with labelling yourself as whatever you want but there‚Äôs a point where it gets a bit silly especially when you‚Äôre posting it publicly.

<p>I spent a few years Thai Boxing, it was a great workout and I enjoyed it, I never stepped in the ring though so personally I&#39;d just feel really stupid posting a thread saying &quot;As a former Thai-Boxer I think Thai Boxing is pathetic/dumb&quot; as I was never a Thai Boxer, I have no achievements as a Thai Boxer, I am not recognised as a Thai Boxer, I&#39;m just a dude who did some Thai Boxing classes for a few years.

<p>This is the entire title of the post:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>As a former bodybuilder before the pandemic, I now view bodybuilding as cringe and pathetic</p>

<p>Although lots of his post was dedicated to his own commitments we can&#39;t ignore the actual title. I&#39;ll also point out that one of the first rules of this sub is:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Your post must be an opinion. Not a question. Not a showerthought. Not a rant. Not a proposal. Not a fact. <strong>An opinion.

<p>If OP somehow didn&#39;t mean that he viewed bodybuilding as cringe and pathetic then this post breaks the rules as that is the opinion posted in the post title.</p>

<p>To be a competing body builder maybe. But joe blow who is just as jacked is also a body builder even if he doesn&#39;t look bronze and pose.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>Which is the competing aspect. Similar to how those models still dress nice even if they aren&#39;t on the runway. Body builders can build without competing. Gatekeeping the term is the issue not the skill it take to be a pro.</p>

<p>a sport involving strenuous physical exercise in order to strengthen and enlarge the muscles of the body.</p>

<p>Now that thats there can we agree on that definition?</p>

<p>Next, when you go throw a baseball with a friend or shoot hoops at a park you know you are engaging in the sport right? Do I have to be on a competing basketball team to be considered a basketball player? Even though I do it to the same caliber as most armature teams? No. Same for body building.</p>

I had to stop deadlifts for a few weeks and then returned back to a shoulder-width grip. </p>

<p>My main shoulder workouts leaned towards barbell press (sitting down) and Arnold press, as well as dumbbell press. I did standing overhead shoulder press more as an auxiliary workout. I lifted up to 70 lbs but I deloaded back down to 40 lbs to get a better range of motion.</p>

<p>For rhomboids, I really focused on T-bar rows and bent-over-barbell rows. During my deadlifts, I would initially squeeze my back during the lifts, but later stopped (it actually works your traps better if you do it naturally).</p>

<p>I started off with a typical program on bodybuilding.com, but over the course of 4 years, I would frequently modify and tweak it based on my needs. I also made sure to switch up my routines every 3-4 months (after a few years I‚Äôd have to switch it up more frequently, like every 2 months, due to plateaus).</p>

<div class="md"><p>Bro you don&#39;t have to compete in &quot;professional&quot; bodybuilding to be a bodybuilder.  Plenty of amateurs out there who compete at local/regional shows just for the love of the sport.  </p>

<p>Lifting, taking supplements/gear and not competing does not classify one as a bodybuilder.  It also doesn&#39;t make you &quot;less than&quot; an actual bodybuilder.  I support the gatekeeping of the term &quot;bodybuilder&quot; because it confuses the term for those of us who are actually dedicated to the sport.. who eat, sleep and breathe it.  Who sacrifice months of just feeling normal to get into contest shape.  That&#39;s what classifies one as a bodybuilder.  Just train for progress-sake and be happy.</p>

<p>It&#39;s like everyone here thinks actual bodybuilders are saying that they are better than people who work out.  That&#39;s not what&#39;s going on.  Like you said, it&#39;s a sport.  Bodybuilders eat, sleep and breathe this... they sacrifice months of feeling like absolute dog shit to get into contest shape.. all for a single day on the stage.  We aren&#39;t better than you, we just ARE bodybuilders.. you just work out.  BTW you may train like a bodybuilder, eat like one, take the supps/gear like one - if that&#39;s the case, way to go bro that&#39;s something to be super proud of.

<p>This is the entire title of the post:</p>

<p>As a former bodybuilder before the pandemic, I now view bodybuilding as cringe and pathetic</p>

<p>Although lots of his post was dedicated to his own commitments we can&#39;t ignore the actual title. I&#39;ll also point out that one of the first rules of this sub is:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Your post must be an opinion. Not a question. Not a showerthought. Not a rant. Not a proposal. Not a fact. <strong>An opinion.

<p>If OP somehow didn&#39;t mean that he viewed bodybuilding as cringe and pathetic then this post breaks the rules as that is the opinion posted in the post title.</p>

<p>To be a competing body builder maybe. But joe blow who is just as jacked is also a body builder even if he doesn&#39;t look bronze and pose.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>Which is the competing aspect. Similar to how those models still dress nice even if they aren&#39;t on the runway. Body builders can build without competing. Gatekeeping the term is the issue not the skill it take to be a pro.</p>

<div class="md"><p>I&#39;m not defensive. I&#39;m calling out an asshole. </p>

<p>Call it what you like body building by definition is</p>

<p>a sport involving strenuous physical exercise in order to strengthen and enlarge the muscles of the body.</p>

<p>Now that thats there can we agree on that definition?</p>

<p>Next, when you go throw a baseball with a friend or shoot hoops at a park you know you are engaging in the sport right? Do I have to be on a competing basketball team to be considered a basketball player? Even though I do it to the same caliber as most armature teams? No. Same for body building.</p>

<div class="md"><p>This is a pretty big thing that I&#39;ve noticed too.  I used to work in gyms and with a company who provided meal-prepped food.  I&#39;m also a bodybuilder (like, actually a bodybuilder - I compete and everything).  I can&#39;t tell you how many times someone who just works out calls themselves a bodybuilder.  </p>

<div class="md"><p>For deadlifts, I started off with shoulder-width stance and slightly wider-than-shoulder-width grip. After about 2 years of this I switched to a shoulder-width stance and a wide-arm-grip. I did this for a few months before I injured my back during a workout. I had to stop deadlifts for a few weeks and then returned back to a shoulder-width grip. </p>

<p>My main shoulder workouts leaned towards barbell press (sitting down) and Arnold press, as well as dumbbell press. I did standing overhead shoulder press more as an auxiliary workout. I lifted up to 70 lbs but I deloaded back down to 40 lbs to get a better range of motion.</p>

<p>For rhomboids, I really focused on T-bar rows and bent-over-barbell rows. During my deadlifts, I would initially squeeze my back during the lifts, but later stopped (it actually works your traps better if you do it naturally).</p>

<p>I started off with a typical program on bodybuilding.com, but over the course of 4 years, I would frequently modify and tweak it based on my needs. I also made sure to switch up my routines every 3-4 months (after a few years I‚Äôd have to switch it up more frequently, like every 2 months, due to plateaus).</p>

<div class="md"><p>Bro you don&#39;t have to compete in &quot;professional&quot; bodybuilding to be a bodybuilder.  Plenty of amateurs out there who compete at local/regional shows just for the love of the sport.  </p>

<p>Lifting, taking supplements/gear and not competing does not classify one as a bodybuilder.  It also doesn&#39;t make you &quot;less than&quot; an actual bodybuilder.  I support the gatekeeping of the term &quot;bodybuilder&quot; because it confuses the term for those of us who are actually dedicated to the sport.. who eat, sleep and breathe it.  Who sacrifice months of just feeling normal to get into contest shape.  That&#39;s what classifies one as a bodybuilder.  Just train for progress-sake and be happy.</p>

<p>It&#39;s like everyone here thinks actual bodybuilders are saying that they are better than people who work out.  That&#39;s not what&#39;s going on.  Like you said, it&#39;s a sport.  Bodybuilders eat, sleep and breathe this... they sacrifice months of feeling like absolute dog shit to get into contest shape.. all for a single day on the stage.  We aren&#39;t better than you, we just ARE bodybuilders.. you just work out.  BTW you may train like a bodybuilder, eat like one, take the supps/gear like one - if that&#39;s the case, way to go bro that&#39;s something to be super proud of.

<p>To be a competing body builder maybe. But joe blow who is just as jacked is also a body builder even if he doesn&#39;t look bronze and pose.</p>

<p>Which is the competing aspect. Similar to how those models still dress nice even if they aren&#39;t on the runway. Body builders can build without competing. Gatekeeping the term is the issue not the skill it take to be a pro.</p>

<p>If some dude at the pub introduced himself as a bodybuilder and he weighed 12 stone at 5‚Äô11 you‚Äôd think he was taking the piss lol.</p>

<p>I‚Äôm not sure if people have taken my comments out of context, I‚Äôm not being nasty here, 5‚Äô11 180lbs low body fat is a good physique, it‚Äôs just not a bodybuilder.</p>

<p>Call it what you like body building by definition is</p>

<p>a sport involving strenuous physical exercise in order to strengthen and enlarge the muscles of the body.</p>

<p>Now that thats there can we agree on that definition?</p>

<p>Next, when you go throw a baseball with a friend or shoot hoops at a park you know you are engaging in the sport right? Do I have to be on a competing basketball team to be considered a basketball player? Even though I do it to the same caliber as most armature teams? No. Same for body building.</p>

<div class="md"><p>Bro you don&#39;t have to compete in &quot;professional&quot; bodybuilding to be a bodybuilder.  Plenty of amateurs out there who compete at local/regional shows just for the love of the sport.  </p>

<p>Lifting, taking supplements/gear and not competing does not classify one as a bodybuilder.  It also doesn&#39;t make you &quot;less than&quot; an actual bodybuilder.  I support the gatekeeping of the term &quot;bodybuilder&quot; because it confuses the term for those of us who are actually dedicated to the sport.. who eat, sleep and breathe it.  Who sacrifice months of just feeling normal to get into contest shape.  That&#39;s what classifies one as a bodybuilder.  Just train for progress-sake and be happy.</p>

<div class="md"><p>This needs to be higher up in this thread... everyone saying it&#39;s &quot;gatekeeping&quot;.. well, yeah it is.  </p>

<p>It&#39;s like everyone here thinks actual bodybuilders are saying that they are better than people who work out.  That&#39;s not what&#39;s going on.  Like you said, it&#39;s a sport.  Bodybuilders eat, sleep and breathe this... they sacrifice months of feeling like absolute dog shit to get into contest shape.. all for a single day on the stage.  We aren&#39;t better than you, we just ARE bodybuilders.. you just work out.  BTW you may train like a bodybuilder, eat like one, take the supps/gear like one - if that&#39;s the case, way to go bro that&#39;s something to be super proud of.  But you&#39;re still not a bodybuilder.</p>

<p>To be a competing body builder maybe. But joe blow who is just as jacked is also a body builder even if he doesn&#39;t look bronze and pose.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>Which is the competing aspect. Similar to how those models still dress nice even if they aren&#39;t on the runway. Body builders can build without competing. Gatekeeping the term is the issue not the skill it take to be a pro.</p>

<p>They may not sound different to the layman but body building implies participation in the actual sport and competition of body building. Anyone can be a weight lifter.</p>

<div class="md"><p>This needs to be higher up in this thread... everyone saying it&#39;s &quot;gatekeeping&quot;.. well, yeah it is.  </p>

<p>It&#39;s like everyone here thinks actual bodybuilders are saying that they are better than people who work out.  That&#39;s not what&#39;s going on.  Like you said, it&#39;s a sport.  Bodybuilders eat, sleep and breathe this... they sacrifice months of feeling like absolute dog shit to get into contest shape.. all for a single day on the stage.  We aren&#39;t better than you, we just ARE bodybuilders.. you just work out.  BTW you may train like a bodybuilder, eat like one, take the supps/gear like one - if that&#39;s the case, way to go bro that&#39;s something to be super proud of.  But you&#39;re still not a bodybuilder.</p>

<p>It would be like me playing football with my buddies and then telling people that I&#39;m a football player.</p>

<p>This is the entire title of the post:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>As a former bodybuilder before the pandemic, I now view bodybuilding as cringe and pathetic</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Although lots of his post was dedicated to his own commitments we can&#39;t ignore the actual title. I&#39;ll also point out that one of the first rules of this sub is:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Your post must be an opinion. Not a question. Not a showerthought. Not a rant. Not a proposal. Not a fact. <strong>An opinion. One opinion.</strong> A subjective statement about your position on some topic. <strong>Please have a clear, self contained opinion as your post title</strong>, and use the text field to elaborate and expand on why you think/feel this way.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>If OP somehow didn&#39;t mean that he viewed bodybuilding as cringe and pathetic then this post breaks the rules as that is the opinion posted in the post title.</p>

<p>To be a competing body builder maybe. But joe blow who is just as jacked is also a body builder even if he doesn&#39;t look bronze and pose.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>Which is the competing aspect. Similar to how those models still dress nice even if they aren&#39;t on the runway. Body builders can build without competing. Gatekeeping the term is the issue not the skill it take to be a pro.</p>

<p>If some dude at the pub introduced himself as a bodybuilder and he weighed 12 stone at 5‚Äô11 you‚Äôd think he was taking the piss lol.</p>

<p>I‚Äôm not sure if people have taken my comments out of context, I‚Äôm not being nasty here, 5‚Äô11 180lbs low body fat is a good physique, it‚Äôs just not a bodybuilder.</p>

<p>Which is the competing aspect. Similar to how those models still dress nice even if they aren&#39;t on the runway. Body builders can build without competing. Gatekeeping the term is the issue not the skill it take to be a pro.</p>

<div class="md"><p>Like eats? And what else lol? Work out and eat to gain... stop pretending the muscle heads are doing anything other than building thier body&#39;s. If they compete that&#39;s great it doesn&#39;t mean the rest aren&#39;t body builders.</p>
