<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Hey friend, I hope you are well. I am 5&#39;9.5, currently 162 pounds, I was 153 pounds before I started lifting. I am well versed when it comes to fitness, I have never fully devoted myself to working out however. I started lifting a month ago, I have increased the size of my arms and chest whilst strengthening my legs (no visible gain but strength gain is definitely there). I gained strength very rapidly (happens when you begin to work your muscles for the first time) and I hit a bit of a plateau. I moved up from benching 10 pounds (each side of 45 lb barbell) to 25. I was struggling with 25 but quickly started being able to be stable with the bar and complete more controlled sets. I can now bench 35 lbs, and can bench 45 lbs 4-5 times. I only started lifting a month and a half ago. My question is, in the past two weeks I have seen a noticable gain in my chest and arms, yet still struggle with 35 pounds. I work out once or twice a week, so I am thankful for my gains, however, I increased my mass from 160-164 in the past two weeks yet my bench is still just as strong as it was two weeks ago. With the gains going to my arms and chest (which can clearly be seen) I do not understand why my bench has not somewhat improved. Please share your expertise, thanks and have a great day!</p>
