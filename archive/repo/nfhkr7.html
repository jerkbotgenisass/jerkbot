How do jacked dudes handle the weird attention?

<div class="post">
<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>30/M here.</p>

<p>This weekend I went snowboarding with some friends. It was a sunny, warm, spring day so we decided to ride in shorts and tank-tops and so on. I&#39;m a pretty muscular guy (I compete in powerlifting) and I occasionally get comments from people (usually dudes). However, this weekend was the weirdest encounter I&#39;ve had.</p>

<p>This woman in the lift line sees me and immediately (and loudly) asks me if I lift weights. I thought she just joking around, so I joked back by saying &quot;Nah, mostly just pilates&quot;, but she thought I was being serious and said something to the effect of &quot;oh okay so you actually do something with your muscles&quot;.</p>

<p>The whole lift line goes silent and starts paying attention to this conversation. It was in this moment I became pretty uncomfortable. I decided to clarify to her that I was just joking, and I told her that I compete in powerlifting. Not sure if she just didn&#39;t hear me or just didn&#39;t listen, but she responds with &quot;So are these just pretty muscles or do you actually use them?&quot;.</p>

<p>Again, everyone around us is watching and listening. It was so fuckin awkward and uncomfortable. To make things weirder, it turns out her husband was in line with her. Who tf does that right in front of their spouse?</p>

<p>I felt like she was basically calling me out because she thought I was some douche who only lifts weights just to look good. Which there is absolutely nothing wrong with, in my opinion.</p>

<p>So here my issue. Firstly, how would you handle this situation and has something like this ever happened to you before? Secondly, I&#39;ve not looked this way my whole life, I took up lifting a couple years ago and my physique has changed significantly in that time. It&#39;s made me a lot more confident but also I feel like a try-hard anytime I wear sleeveless shirts. Frankly, I&#39;m not used to the attention I get and I&#39;m not sure how to best handle it. I don&#39;t want to go out of my way cover myself up if I don&#39;t want to, but I also don&#39;t want to make others uncomfortable. I just want to be treated normally.</p>

<p>EDIT: To all the guys trying to get into lifting and such, I&#39;m rooting for all of you. You 100% have the ability to make the changes you&#39;re looking for, just stick with it and trust the process!!! Consistency (and maybe a good sleep schedule) has a far greater impact than any other variable. Even if you feel like garbage, get your workout in and MAINTAIN the discipline to continue the routine. You literally cannot fail if you never quit.</p>

<p>These women came straight up calling me insecure and wanting to be an alpha male because I probably think that&#39;s how you get girls? I say okay that&#39;s your opinion, have a nice day.

<div class="md"><p>There is nothing wrong with it, but the fact is that there is a whole industry for male body image centered around PED usage that also denies...PED usage.</p>

<p>Men tend to gravitate towards the &quot;I&#39;m too small&quot; end of body dysmorphia (though, there are men who think they&#39;re too big of course) and rampant PED use portrayed as natty and loads of chickenricebroccolone is damaging to men.</p>

<p>Idk how one can think one is insecure for actually putting in the work and doing everything right like dieting to look good and jacked you know?</p>

<p>I&#39;m a very thin guy myself and always get those same comments. But it&#39;s never occurred to me that it should be socially acceptable both ways. </p>

<div class="md"><p>Regardless of the reason, no matter what they say, you are not obligated to respond or acknowledge if a stranger is talking to you. Perhaps some people say it is  rude, but who cares what they think. You can just look at someone and not say anything. You can just smile if u want, or just laugh. Or just stare at them. I do it all of the time and its kind of fun. I mean if someone is nice to me thats a different thing. But generally its more rude to comment on a strangers appearance than it is to just ignore someone. So ignoring them is actually a pretty reasonable response to people being rude.</p>

<div class="md"><p>I&#39;m on the fence as to whether &quot;none of yer biz&quot; would be a good response. It would appear to be an overreaction in many cases so...</p>

<p>I sort of de-escalate. Might have done like you and downplayed it at first, then answer less and less, or one-word replies. Also body language. Turn around away from her, pointedly, after a one-word answer. And if she goes again, take 5 seconds before turning back around to answer.</p>

<p>Lastly, I find that being polite but firm and with boundaries better suits my personality and is the person I want to be. It also tends to be met with more respect. Like you won&#39;t stoop down to argue or refute.</p>

<p>Silence is golden here. Consider for example someone verbally haranguing you (different, I know) while you&#39;re just silent and calm, your body language showing neither intimidation nor anger, nor frustration.</p>

<p>JMHO&#39;s. And yeah, in general just own it and assume a positive meaning.</p>

<div class="md"><p>Hey, it doesn’t matter if they’re trying to be rude or not. You felt uncomfortable by what they said and that’s the important part. You can set boundaries even with complete strangers by: 
-Being honest “uh, the way you said that makes me uncomfortable” 
-By shutting down the convo “I don’t want to talk about this anymore” </p>

<p>-Or my favorite: Not responding. If what they said makes you uncomfortable then you can make it socially awkward for them</p>

<p>I don&#39;t normally get that level of open attention but I do notice looks every now and then, mostly from older women and gay dudes. I&#39;m from a pretty conservative place so aside from a couple of catcalls from gay dudes, girls generally don&#39;t say anything about my physique. It&#39;s mostly guys that stare too. A while ago, I was rowing 125kgs for reps. Three guys were watching and the the only girl didn&#39;t care lmao. It gets kinda annoying when the occasional gym bro tries striking a conversation mid set though but thankfully I look very uninviting at the gym that it only happened a couple of times so far.</p>

<div class="md"><p>Honestly I mostly don&#39;t get much negative attention either. It&#39;s not as bad as some shorter guys claim.</p>

<p>That said, I&#39;ve had a similar mindset that I&#39;m generally invisible to women. And the reality is (one that I&#39;m still trying to accept) is that we actually have no way of knowing that. It&#39;s a narrative that we tell ourselves and we choose to believe.</p>

<p>In reality, if a woman thought you were cute or whatev, but was just as shy or reserved like many other people (regardless of gender), you&#39;d literally have no way of knowing how they felt.</p>

<p>I&#39;m still working on this myself, so I&#39;m no expert, but I&#39;ve had a decent amount of experience w/ women thanks to online dating. You kinda just have to open yourself up to it. I realized that I had a tendancy to be avoidant without realizing as a way of protecting myself. Maybe you&#39;re doing something similar?</p>

<p>I highly doubt you&#39;re as universally undesirable as you think!!</p>

<div class="md"><p>The answer is always to do what you want/makes you happy in life and not because you want to impress others.  Eventually someone will come along who -in addition to liking your physique- will be attracted to your discipline and dedication and you will get the attention you want now.  Being needy of attention (or in any way) is not attractive to a woman.</p>

<div class="md"><p>It&#39;s not so cut and dry. I&#39;m 5&#39;3 and when I was in really good shape I 100% got more attention from girls. They just didn&#39;t necessarily come right out and say it was because of my body until we got to know each other better. </p>

<p>But ya most of the people that straight up told me &quot;dam bro you&#39;re shredded&quot; were dudes lol</p>

<div class="md"><p>A lot of women have experienced awkward or downright uncomfortable staring themselves, so more respectful women might be trying to <em>not</em> stare (or at least be more subtle about it)</p>

<div class="md"><p>Most girls don&#39;t really care how strong you are or that you&#39;re huge. They only care that you look fit and have abs. </p>

<p>When you get to a certain size, you&#39;re doing it more for yourself and to impress other dudes. Which is why dudes check out other big dudes.</p>

<div class="md"><p>I shrug it off and pretend it&#39;s due to my work, this way they think I&#39;m a hard worker, not really interested in talking about lifting with people who don&#39;t lift and the people who do know you aren&#39;t going to look like I do from gardening.</p>
