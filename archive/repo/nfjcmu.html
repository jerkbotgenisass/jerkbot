<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Hi everyone. I’ve been carnivore for over a year now and am trying to do a bulk in the gym. I have not counted calories at all in the year. My main question is that for those of you that bulk on carnivore, do you count calories? It seems super difficult to track calories for eating steaks and roasts. In addition anyone who has had success bulking (and not getting fat) on carnivore I would very much appreciate any tips you may have</p>

<div class="md"><p>Have you been losing weight over the last year or maintaining? If you are at maintenance and can stomach more meat then just add a couple more lean ounces at each meal. If you are in a deficit and can’t stomach much more then eat fattier cuts for more calories per oz</p>

<div class="md"><p>I’ve gained 15lbs so far and am just getting more and more muscular (I’ve always been skinny and I’m not putting weight on my mid section). But for me I need to track to make sure I’m in a surplus and get plenty of animal fats like butter and cheese. Carnivore can be satiating and it’s easy to under-eat. If you can tolerate butter (it’s got little dairy anyway) or other dairy then that’s a great way to go. Otherwise ghee, suet or other non-dairy fats</p>

<div class="md"><p>I counted calories for two months while doing this diet, weightlifting and doing routine cardio, aerobic and (more so) anaerobic. </p>

<p>I only lost fat, did not gain. But it was generally not extreme fat loss, just gradual. </p>

<p>Also, I gained weight (muscle mass) very rapidly. With significant changes in visible vascularity. </p>

<p>However, increases in strength were relatively not on par. It did take more work and time to notice the same gains there, but eventually they came.</p>

<p>So hypertrophy, eccentric overload, muscle failure - no issues. Only drawback was in heavy strength training. </p>

<p>All I can say is ribeyes and brisket can add a TON of calories when you eat a pound of it at a time, several times a day, and get the rest of your nutrients from offal (heart, liver, tongue, tail). </p>

<p>I’m still eating like this and waiting to hit a plateau but after 90+ days, still haven’t. </p>

<p>I think calling this woe “as anabolic as steroids” would not completely be an overstatement.</p>

<div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t count calories, just eat when hungry. If you can tolerate it, try adding dairy. I credit homemade kefir for my weight gain. Lately I&#39;ve been siphoning off the whey, because it&#39;s the more insulinogenic fraction and it made my ketones drop a bit (I like my ketones kinda high for health reasons)</p>

<div class="md"><p>I&#39;ve been making kefir as well. Curious how you&#39;re siphoning off whey. Just fermenting a bit longer to separate then pouring it out?</p>

<div class="md"><p>Not true at all.  It&#39;s still a measure of the amount of energy going into your body.   Gaining or losing weight is absolutely determined by how much you eat.  If you eat 20 lbs of ribeye a day, you will gain weight.  If you eat only 1/2 lb of chicken breast per day, you will lose weight.</p>

<p>Carnivore helps control people&#39;s appetites by reducing insulin responses, hormonal changes,etc.  but it still doesn&#39;t change the basic math of energy consumption</p>

<div class="md"><p>It’s not. The calorie count of food indicates how much heat energy it gives off when burned.  That doesn’t tell us anything about what it does in the human body.</p>

<p>When I began my switch to keto (before carnivore) I was drinking close to a gallon of heavy cream (if not more) 5-7 days out of the week.  I was also eating twice a day. I was not working out.</p>

<p>And yet I was losing weight everyday.  I was consuming in excess of 10,000 calories a day, and was losing weight while not being intensely active.</p>

<p>By all calorie logic, I should have been gaining weight.  I wasn’t.  Not even close. I was losing it.</p>

<p>CICO is non-sense pushed forth by the food industry to sell 100 calorie “snack packs”.</p>

<p>You won’t gain weight if you eat 20 pounds of ribeye; you’ll never eat 20 pounds of ribeye unless you eat sugar as well.</p>

<p>Without sugar to mess with hormones, you’ll hit satiety once you have enough nutrients. </p>

<p>We eat for nutrients, not calories.</p>

<div class="md"><p>Also, if you only eat half a pound of chicken breast a day you’ll quickly have issues with nutrients.</p>

<p>The human body needs fat, protein, vitamins, minerals, and water. It does not need anything else.</p>

<p>Technically EVERYTHING has calories; it can all be burned.</p>
