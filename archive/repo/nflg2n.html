<p>24 months ago I started my journey towards a muscular body I was not on a lowest point of my life, everything was fine, i just wanted muscles. I was 80kg, 183cm, skinny and no muscle at all. (26 years old)</p>

<p>No pictures cause you know how 80kg and 180cm look like for untrained people.</p>

<p>I did the &quot;of course&quot; special unlimited super mega owerpowered RR.</p>

<p>Let&#39;s just give a hint, that after few months after starting i got very sad regarding my journey.</p>

<p>At first everything was nice. All factors outside of training, and also training were good. I made progress. It was much slower than the average persons training. But I didn&#39;t know that in that time. LOL.</p>

<p>Then progress stopped. I tried various things like more sets, less sets, more reps, less sets, more rest between sets, less frequency per week. And who knows what else.  LOL</p>

<p>Still nothing.</p>

<p>I paid money here and there for coaches. Was useless. xD They gave me so much volume only godzilla could do so much volume.</p>

<p>And today after roughly 24 months i have less muscle than at the start. :)</p>

<p>Love you all.</p>

<p>Post scriptum. After 24 months i still cannot do more chin ups, push ups, etc. compared to the start. After 6 months or so i was able to do more than in the beginning but then my body declined like a zombie.</p>

<p>Btw. complete blood count is good.</p>

<p>PS: if somebody tells you to train harder just dislike them. Or if you dont wanna dislike them, ask if they will give you supplements which make you lift more. ;) If they dont, then dislike them. Cause &quot;train harder, sleep more, eat more&quot; is just shitposting from people who have 0 experience with &quot;no progress&quot;. They are lucky, have it very easy.</p>

<div class="md"><p>Lets start with an obvious one. If you get asked to do too much volume, why is it too much? Are you not able to or don&#39;t you recover well enough or what is it in your mind? Recovery is key, even if most things circle around the training and eating.</p>

<div class="md"><p>High volume as in 35 sets per week and muscle.</p>

<p>RR is 18 sets.</p>

<p>I would guess i cannot recover from such volume.  Perhaps for 1 or 2 session i can recover. But then i stop recovering.</p>
