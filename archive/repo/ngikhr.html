<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Hi guys,
I recently read a lot of stuff on reddit due to a friend who asked me about his training routine for advice. With the conversation continuing, I wondered where he obtained his so called new training methods.</p>

<p>Keeping in mind that he is a real beginner and is figuring out what to do and what he may be should not to.
Each person has its own past, physically and mentally, so a start would be for everybody a different one. Here comes a little advice regarding two exercisess.</p>

<p>Deadlifts
Pistol squads </p>

<p>I am pointing them both out because they can have a severe impact on your life! These exercises should not be executed without any supervision as they can lead to heavy injuries. You will find a lot of alternatives (google or ask for it) which are way more efficient than these one. Pistol squads are overpressuring the whole knee, especially the knee cap with its front area. Even without any weights on it, this particular exercise bears great risk and not so much gain. Heavy weight lifters do not even have them in their training routine and I wonder where this physical degenerated movement comes from. It makes in general no sense at all to force the whole pressure on one point, if the angle is targeting all of the ankle instead of the muscle. Sure, you feel this also in your muscular area but if you could ask your cartilage, it would just cry. 
For pistol squads, there should exist a general warning disclaimer. </p>

<p>Deadlifts on the other hand have a good solid background. It is a pro-exercise for strengthening various parts of the body, if executed correctly. It is definitely not one for beginners, even amateurs or people with back injuries. The main reason for mentioning deadlifts is that many people put them in their routine with maxing out the weights but in this case, only one mistake could lead to a dislocated spinal disk. If this thing jumps out one time, the risk to have it frequently is high. Be aware of your limits as some exercises are not bearing a high risk if you reach them. The exercise itself, if supervised correctly, is great! Still there are many alternitives, which also add more flexibility to it(plyometrics). Deadlifts are one of the most common exercises nowadays and it seems to have it in the arsenal is standard but this a pro-exercise. Even professionals do it most of the time with a co-partner. If you do it, make sure to take care of yourself and always watch your back. 5000 reps were good, you feel safe doing it, get a little bit careless, but the next rep after, a little mistake and the damage is done. </p>

<p>That&#39;s it for me, maybe someone will take it in perspective. This message is not meant to be in an offending way(at least not for deadlifts). If you do these exercises, and you are good with it, please take care of yourself on your way on. </p>

<p>For all beginners... Please build up yourself first before doing these in order to prevent you from being injured. I hope this gives you some clarity about this topic if you are on your way to get into sports. Take care! </p>

<p>To my background: 19 years of Boxing, 12 years Muay Thai and Thai Chi, 16 years of Basketball, also trainer for competitors </p>

<p>As I&#39;m not a native english speaking person, please go easy on me<sup><sup>.</sup></sup></p>

<div class="md"><p>Plyometrics provide a tremendous opportunity for injury. There is virtually NO exercise that can&#39;t be made harmful by careless performance.</p>

<p>The problem is that the people who NEED warning and correction don&#39;t recognize the fact. Most of them cannot follow instructions well enough to do the &#39;safer&#39; activities either.</p>

<div class="md"><p>I agree with your second part. On the other hand, Plyometric BASICS have seriously a low risk ob being injured, you feel it right away, if you start them and are not fit to do, there are different levels of intensity to pracrice. Plyometrics is just a modern word for things we have done, as we grew up. Sure, injuries can always happen if you jump but what do you do more often, walking upstairs, run or jump a little or are lifting up heavy object in a very unnatural way, where you have to concentrate on every movement? The routine makes the difference. To say that every exercise has the ability to inflict injuries due carelessness is simply wrong, thai chi for example has many of them, where couldn&#39;t be more careless but also some basics exercise are really harmless even practiced careless. That&#39;s why they so good to start with.</p>

</blockquote>

<p>Is it though?</p>

<p>Outside of powerlifting, you rarely have people maxing out any exercise.</p>

<p>Any standard strength training program has you doing multiple sub max repetitions and the typical 1/2/3/4 standard which exists as a form of flex in some communities is always for 5 reps.</p>

</blockquote>

<p>I find the notion of deadlifts being a &quot;pro-exercise&quot; quite misleading to beginners, since it implies it to not be meant for them.</p>

<p>I agree that correct technique is very important, but having to correctly learn a technique does not make it a pro exercise.</p>

<p>I would argue that it is actually the absolute opposite of a pro exercise.</p>

<p>As one of the move patterns that is quite present in daily life (working manually often involves picking up stuff from the ground in a dl manner) it is a more basic move pattern rather than a pro one.</p>

<div class="md"><p>Yes...they have a better movement but always keep the hip over the knee ankle height. Otherwise you generate to much pressure onto the knee cap.</p>

<div class="md"><p>Why would a pistol be more dangerous than a barbell squat with well over your bodyweight on your back?</p>

<p>Why should anyone take your advice about lifting when your credentials have nothing to do with lifting?</p>
