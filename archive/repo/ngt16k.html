<div class="md"><p>I definitely recommend giving this guy a follow<br/>
 (Hybrid Calisthenics). Most of his posts are like this and give ways to slowly improve without hurting yourself combined with an inspirational attitude.

<div class="md"><p>I understand what you mean, but it absolutely does not have to be like that. I grew up morbidly obese and with some health conditions, and physical activity was all about guilt and shame. Then health got better and I started a new approach for other aspects of life. Approach being &quot;Fuck it&quot;. Then I automatically used the same approach to fitness and it changed everything. If you want to do it, do it. Do it for yourself, not for others. Do it minding what YOU think of yourself, care for yourself and love yourself. Don&#39;t ever think of anyone else when you exercise (or when you do anything else in life to be honest). Fitness is one of the highest expression of self love one can perform. I wish you luck and a wonderful life my fellow human.</p>

<div class="md"><p>Glad you asked!</p>

<p>&#x200B;</p>

<p>I believe you are referring to going to the gym and do a certain amount of reps. I understand that could not be your cup of tea and it is absolutely fine! As the guy in the video says &quot;Everyone is in a different place in their fitness journey&quot;. That includes also likes, dislikes, personal preferences etc.</p>

<p>&#x200B;</p>

<p>Fitness is a broad term and could include different things depending on your age, sex, gender, health, preferences, etc.</p>

<p>&#x200B;</p>

<p>Personally I&#39;d tell everyone who wants to better themselves one thing: &quot;Just start&quot;. If you don&#39;t like gyms, go for a walk, better than sitting around all day. Want to spend some quality time with friends? Go for hikes. Go play tennis, go play football, rugby, whatever you like. It is also a great way to make new friends if you need some more. </p>

<p>&#x200B;</p>

<p>Your goal is specifically the gym and you are looking for a way to make it less boring? You can do many things. Listen to music, whatever pumps you up, be it hard metal or Cartoon themes. Whatever works for you. Set a goal and log the updates whenever you can. Most of the times lack of visible improvements can hit you hard. Watch something while exercising, I see many people doing it at the gym. Bring someone with you, work out together and bond over those gains. You can literally do whatever you feel like.</p>

<p>&#x200B;</p>

<p>For me it started with wanting to generally improve my appearance, but then once you start, you begin to feel better everyday, both mentally and physically, and when you slip and go back to feel like the old days, that really hits you hard. It&#39;s like the best of drugs. Going to the gym or exercising in general now is a strong need for me, for my mental health.</p>

<div class="md"><p>Sometimes we have to accept the tedious and boring parts of life for the benefits they bring. </p>

<p>Personally I find brushing my teeth tedious and boring, but I like not being in pain, being able to eat a variety of food and not having to pay big dental bills, so I brush them. Exercise is the same. Except eventually it becomes fun as your fitness increases and you can find yourself doing more stuff. But to begin with, treat it like brushing your teeth.</p>

<div class="md"><p>If you&#39;re not used to working out this can be hard, but it goes along with not giving a fuck, just do what you want to do (again that might take a bit of trial and error but you should instantly feel what you like or dont like when you try it)  Even just go climb a tree or jump along rocks, that&#39;s the shit I do, I&#39;m in my mid 20&#39;s and I like to think I&#39;m at least a step or two above average strength/fitness but I havent stepped foot in an actual gym in <em>years</em>. Like I HATE the concept of treadmills, even worse are the treadmill/eliptical bikes for people who want a treadmil but want to also be able to move around.. just go for a run and if you&#39;re worried about the impact just run slower or go for a decent walk, the effort will still be the same and the fresh air and real world environment will be much better.</p>

<div class="md"><p>Put on some enjoyable music and let your mind wander. When you first start doing it it’s hard to do that since you’re feeling unfamiliar strains and aches but as you progress a little it becomes easier. Once you have the movements down you can enter a pseudo auto-pilot kind  of state where your muscle memory is doing most of the work and most of your mind is thinking about other stuff. The easiest version of this is when you’re on the treadmill or elliptical; walking/running are already very second nature to you so you don’t need to think about them at all and you can think about other stuff. Doesn’t really matter what you think about. Think about how badass you’ll look when you’re at the level of fitness you are aiming for, or about some issue at work you’re trying to find a solution for, or go over your schedule for the week, whatever works for you. Once your brain is sufficiently distracted you stop consciously paying attention to time flowing by and before you know it you’re wrapping up your set.</p>

<div class="md"><p>The actual act of exercising can indeed be tedious and sometimes boring, it’s the progression that makes it fun and rewarding. </p>

<p>You need to develop an attitude of “I know it sucks but I also know that the benefits make it worthwhile” to get yourself over that initial 1-2 month long “pain period” where no progress is seen. Start as small as you possibly can but be consistent(ie. Very short runs or just doing a 2/3 exercises in the gym), this way you train your brain not to resist so hard when going to exercise, whilst also getting the release of endorphins from actually exercising. Then just build it up as much as you like. 
When progress starts to happen, it becomes less of a chore because the benefits are more obvious, and you begin to enjoy it :)</p>

<div class="md"><ol>
<li>Start with the only goal being consistency. &quot;Workout&quot; 3xweek without fail, or one time or whatever you will do. </li>
<li>Start with an idea of what you want to do but don&#39;t set goals you can&#39;t meet. I might want to run for 40 minutes three times a week but if I only have 15 minutes after work then it is better to do something for 15 minutes then miss my 3xweek goal. The weekly goal is the only thing that matters.</li>
<li>If you can meet your weekly workout goal for 3 months everything else is likely to come together. </li>
</ol>

<p>Bottom-line, if you go at it long enough working out will become a habit just like not-working out is. The way to achieve that is consistency, do something, anything, trick yourself by telling yourself you will just to a quick easy workout, but don&#39;t allow yourself to make excuses, you need to do something consistently. Soon, you will surprise yourself and that 15 minute workout you didn&#39;t really want to do today will end up being 45 minutes because you felt so much better after got moving. That is how I do it. I just tell me myself it is better to do a short-easy something today than a long-hard something tomorrow.</p>

Know this: I obviously do not know you, but I can say without any doubt that you are a force of nature, a wonderful miracle. I am not kidding and I cannot stress enough the fact that I truly and sincerely believe this.

<div class="md"><p>That’s really inspiring. You should be proud of yourself. I had an accident and find fitness more difficult now, but I’m just doing it to my own standards and ambition, not someone else’s ability, just to to make myself happy.  Any day I do something/anything is a win.</p>

<p>Is there anywhere people on Reddit would appreciate me posting videos here? Should I post them in my own Subreddit? Or is the nature of Reddit to let other people post for it to circulate?</p>

<p>Let me know what&#39;s most convenient for all of you. I can tons of content, so it&#39;s no issue to post it another place.</p>
