Got prescribed TRT after a 4 week Rad140 cycle
<br/><strong>Posted by <a id="userlink" href="https://www.reddit.com/user/anony_b/">anony_b</a>. </strong><em>Posted at 11:22 UTC on May 20, 2021. 2 Points. </em><em>(self.<a id="selfLink" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/trt/">trt</a>)</em><em> (<a id="postpermalink" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/trt/comments/ngxlad/got_prescribed_trt_after_a_4_week_rad140_cycle/">Permalink</a>)</em>
<div class="post">
<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>My worst fears came true. 29 year old male, did a 4 week cycle of rad140. 1st week did 10mg, 2nd week got scared and did 7mg, 3rd week 7mg and 4th week 10mg.</p>

<p>Felt absolutely fantastic until the 4th week. I made gains that Ive never made in my life (been working out since 18) gained 15 pounds, mostly muscle (water weight as well but i look jacked)</p>

<p>I did mk677 as well after the 2nd week of rad140, 10mg a day.</p>

<p>Anyway, I noticed suppressive indicators after the 3rd week, I called my local males clinic and they set me up with a test which would be today (theyre busy)</p>

<p>The symptoms I felt in the 4th week were  my erections werent as hard as they used to be, and i was in a bad mood, plus more hair would fall off my head during showers than usual. So i cut it off at 4 weeks, i already made great gains so i just stopped it. Anyway I go get a testosterone blood test today, results, my estrogen is basically 0 (doctors words) and my testosterone is under 300. He says i need TRT and HCG or else i wont be able to have kids. TRT would be indefinite unless the HCG reactivates my natural test.</p>

<p>So ya guys. I did not think this would happen. I had PCT but didnt even get a chance to do it yet more than 4,5 days, did the test already. Im super bummed out that i did this to myself, but the doctor says its possible I had low T before I started the rad-140…but overall depressing news</p>

<div class="md"><p>So you didn’t even try PCT to kick start your natural production. RAD-140 is suppressive, it did what it is supposed to do. IMHO you are in for a bad time on TRT as both you and your doctor can’t read.</p>

<div class="md"><p>So I see other redditors saying the same thing. I know personally that I took 10 months of working out with T under 300 for 10 months and then my doctor wanted to put me on 200 mg once every two weeks which is a bad protocol from what I read online. So I decide to see and Endocrinologist (not all doctors know everything) I now take 100 mg once a week and feel much better. I started at 36  and my highest natural test level was 240.</p>

<div class="md"><p>Yes, TRT is great. I was 300 pounds and with Phentermine and TRT I have lost over 90 pounds and counting. I will be stopping the Phentermine soon at 100 pounds lost. My test levels are around 750 now and I’m hoping to up my dose soon as my doctor wanted my to lose the weight first as fat converts test to estrogen. </p>

<p>Many people do what you did on purpose to get prescribed TRT. If that’s what you want go for it. You seemed concerned so I was trying to convey that you should take your time and not rush into anything. </p>

<p>I am sooty for how I said it.</p>

<div class="md"><p>This is why I am saying take your time and get your head wrapped around it. TRT is FOREVER. It is replacement therapy, your body WILL shut down it’s natural production. It took me a minute to get comfortable with the idea of doing a shot a week for the rest of my life. I justified it by telling myself that there was a lot of life to live and if I didn’t do it now I wasn’t going to have the quality of life I deserve. I don’t take hcg so I am infertile currently. My doctor says that it is harder to dial in on hcg and only likes to prescribe if you are trying to have kids or if you don’t feel great after starting the TRT.</p>

<div class="md"><p>Yes, my Dr. said I can add it at anytime I want kids or if I don’t respond fully to just test. </p>

<div class="md"><p>PCT takes 6-8 weeks you Neanderthal, not 4-5 days. Most doctors have zero experience with PEDS and are quick to put people on TRT when a proper clomid/adex/HCG will put your levels back to normal. You have no room to call anyone dumb here since you’re the fucking idiot for taking SARMS without doing any research, much less trying out a PCT for 5 days before running and crying to a doctor, otherwise you wouldn’t be on this sub right now. Fuck out of here.</p>

<p>Please go to <a href="/r/peds">r/peds</a> or <a href="/r/steroids">r/steroids</a> and ask for advice there, you will get eaten alive.</p>

<div class="md"><p>Your doctor has no knowledge, but you should&#39;ve at least research before you do steroids/drugs and what to do after</p>

<p>RAD 140(if it was rad and not a mix of other things as it happens) is quite suppressive and a PROPER PCT is required. And that&#39;s if there are not any other sides from the compound itself,which happens too.</p>

<p>Going on TRT because you INTENTIONALLY suppressed your levels and did NOT do PCT is beyond stupid. You will regret it.  Don&#39;t listen to advice in this thread and the &quot;you&#39;ll be ok, trt is ok&quot; they aren&#39;t doctors and most have 0 knowledge. Is that who you want to listen??  Harsh but it is the truth.</p>

<p>Do not do TRT now.  Do the proper PCT. Otherwise you&#39;ll regret this and will be here(as many others) complaining of sides and trt not working) and then will want to come off in a year or 3.</p>

<div class="md"><p>Hahahaha bro doesn’t know what he’s talking about, Jesus Christ. PCT takes longer than 4 or 5 days. And ofc your testosterone was suppressed. Your taking rad140 buddy.

<div class="md"><p>Mate guys ALWAYS recover eventually even after blasting steroids for years. A PCT can speed things up. But even after using TRT for years guys naturally recover, even without a PCT after a few months to a year depending on how long they were on and other factors. Sometimes their levels are a bit lower but they still recover to in range levels. If I were you I&#39;d PCT with either or both of HCG + SERM and get your bloods checked after, then after another 3 months or so of no drugs and good lifestyle. You should be in range then unless you have a physiological issue with your testicles, pituitary or hypothalamus.</p>
