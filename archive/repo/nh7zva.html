Constant diarrhoea every 20 minutes

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>So I’ve been on keto for about 10 days now and never had a problem other than the last 2 days were I’ve had diarrhoea every 20 minutes and every 2 hours if I’m lucky and can sleep. 
I was watching my electrolytes up until yesterday because it’s just been shooting through me. I’d have a bouillon  cube twice a day and also have lite salt, I had magnesium to start but that was giving me a little diarrhoea so I stopped that.
I’ve been under 30g of carbs every day.
Is this normal? because I don’t remember it being like this for me the last 2 times I did keto</p>

<p>Also:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Dont “salt load” - salt should be ingested trough the day.</p></li>
<li><p>Make sure you are not using mag oxide, stick to mag Aspartate or citrate </p></li>
<li><p>Review digestive enzymes </p></li>
<li><p>Don’t do “fat bombs” nor eat high amounts of fat: just because its “keto” thats not the way to eat: fat should come from naturally occurring foods, like eggs, avocado, meats.</p></li>
<li><p>Avoid “ketofied” foods and processed foods.</p></li>

<div class="md"><p>Magnesium citrate is also a laxative. I believe glycinate is the “safest” source</p>

<p>Each type of Magnesium may have different properties, depending on its form.</p>

<div class="md"><p>I’ve done my best not to salt load and I’ve avoided extra magnesium since the first few days as I found I didn’t need any and it was just giving me the runs.
I also don’t do fat bombs or ketoified foods</p>

<div class="md"><p>One day it will suddenly just be normal again. Don&#39;t go too crazy on the fat or electrolytes. It&#39;s gonna take some time for your guts to find homeostasis.</p>

<p>Keep wearing your brown pants and NEVER trust a fart.</p>

<div class="md"><p>Were you able to eat? I’ve only had one small meal  since this started because I have no appetite and am nauseous.
Also how long do you reckon that’ll take cause I have a music festival this weekend and I would rather not have diarrhoea there lmao</p>

<div class="md"><p>If you aren&#39;t eating foods but are still taking supplements, you may be making it worse.  Electrolytes are important but you don&#39;t want concentrated amounts sitting in an otherwise empty digestive system.  At the very least make sure you are hydrating well, and try to get some solid foods.</p>

<div class="md"><p>It might be your gut bacteria struggling with the change. Try to eat prebiotic vegetables and some probiotic fermented foods or take digestive enzymes. You might benefit from soothing warm drinks such as bone broth and mint tea. Take it easy! </p>

<p>Edit to add I drink nettle tea when I have a bad stomach, that’s not based off knowledge or facts it just seems to work for me</p>

<div class="md"><p>This.  Digestive enzymes before every meal.  Cut artificial sweeteners and chill out on the salt and mag....which are diaretics...and people push them so hard online that I&#39;m certain many people are overdoing them.  Kim chi, saurkraut...prebiotic and prebiotic foods/sups.   Add fiber.  Avoid oils if your body isn&#39;t processing them properly.  Avoid caffeine.</p>

<p>Also, the kind of fat is pretty important.  If I eat beef roast swimming in fat...my bowels explode.  I had to switch to different food until my body&#39;s enzymatic profile got more capable of handling the spike in fat.</p>

<div class="md"><p>Increasing your fat intake? depending on the fat and type of fats this can cause the sh*ts</p>
