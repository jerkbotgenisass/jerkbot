<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>- Need a keto mass gainer. I tried making keto cookies but the almond flour doesn&#39;t sit well with me. </p>

<p>Do not reccommend more food, the keto diet is already satiating for me. </p>

<p>just needs reccs for mass gainer powders that are 10g or less.</p>

<li>do not eat milk, cream, cheese, or butter btw</li>

<div class="md"><p>Mass gainers are packed full of carbs. So no. You really won’t find a mass gainer for Keto, as they are just trying to pack as much calories into a shake, while having good protein content, as possible. And carbs are obviously the easiest way to do so. You say no food recommendations, but imma have to recommend food lol. </p>

<p>If you really want to bulk quick then incorporate more carbs. It’s just easier to get more calories that way and can be easier on your gut depending on your situation. Plus if you have a solid workout regime, those carbs will be put to good use. Over any advice anyone can give you, LISTEN TO YOUR BODY. No forum will every give you the amount of info that your own body will :)</p>

<div class="md"><p>To echo the sentiment in here: mass gainers are carby.</p>

<p>A full keto mass gainer is just gonna be very high calorie food in a quick to consume format, and you wanna minimize fibre content so you can slam it down.</p>

<p>Nut butters, oils, etc.  Nuts are so caloric that squeezing them in-between existing meals can really up the daily calories.</p>

<p>Failing that?  Carbs.</p>

<div class="md"><p>Bucked Up has a 0 calorie/carb more or less mass gainer, called &quot;All Bulk, no bloat&quot; while not your traditional mass gainer it helps. While you could just eat more this is a complex question due to such little mainstream information out there on the subject with Keto. I recommend taking a look at (on YouTube) Dr. Eric Berg and Thomas DeLauer. They can explain in a much deeper detail about gains on keto. The more you learn, the more you learn the body is very complex and adapts to a lot of situations, and there tends to be technicalities for just about everything.</p>

<div class="md"><p>Peanut butter, olive oil, and hemp seeds in a shake with protein of choice. I actually had to stop drinking them because I was gaining too much weight lol. Be careful with PB though - too much and it hits your stomach like a rock.</p>

<div class="md"><p>I&#39;ve gotten quite a bit of muscle, at least visually. And I&#39;ve been on keto for 2 months.</p>

<p>Personally I lift 5 days a week, full body workout about 3 days, and I run when I feel like it. I don&#39;t like having a scheduele I <em>have</em> to follow or else I&#39;ll ruin my gains, I do what I feel like kind of.</p>

<p>I aim for about 130-140g protein on days that I train. I&#39;ve figured I can go a little higher on the carbs on those days too. On the rest days, I&#39;m not as hungry as I am on the days I train, so I just follow whatever my body tells me. One scoop whey on days that I train but otherwise, just whole foods. Preferably beef, pork, eggs. Vegetables are really important too though.</p>

<p>Sorry now I talked a bit about food, but hey just trying to be helpful.</p>

<div class="md"><p>Mass as in muscle?</p>

<p>I&#39;m on keto and huge.</p>

<p>Just lift really heavy 5 days a week (each body part once per week) and make meat the main part of your keto diet.</p>

<p>Average day for me:</p>

<p>4 eggs + 4 bacon + Kim chi for breakfast</p>

<p>Rib eye </p>

<p>Chicken salad</p>

<p>Pork and broccoli</p>

<p>Some cheese and nuts</p>
