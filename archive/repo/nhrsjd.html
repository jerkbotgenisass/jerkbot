Settle this debate between my boyfriend and I: Sex after leg day doesn't count as real cardio

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>My (F28) boyfriend (M31) and I are very active gymgoers. He&#39;s more involved with bodybuilding strength  training with a very muscular solid build where as I am involved more in HIIT strength and endurance training with a more solid, lean build (and the obligatory big booty workout.) On leg days, he does heavy amounts of weight at large volumes, and because of that, is pretty shaky legged once we come home. Not every leg day, but some leg days, he sometimes airs concerns that having sex counts as cardio and he&#39;s not giving his body the full rest after his work it needs to recuperate. I tell him that sounds like an old wive&#39;s tale/bro science myth, and it&#39;s not as bad as going for a run or something (although we do tend to last at length when we&#39;re having sex.)</p>

<p>We have a very active, healthy sex life otherwise, so it&#39;s nothing of that sort. I&#39;m also totally fine being on top of those big tree trunks of his if need be, but he&#39;s on the dominant side, so it&#39;s hard to keep him on his back the whole time haha</p>

<p>Any advice on this, be it proof that it won&#39;t harm gains or even just other women in similar situations and how they work around it with their partners?</p>
