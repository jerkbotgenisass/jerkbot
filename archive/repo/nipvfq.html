<div class="md"><p>I was about to boot up my PC and look for pictures of me when I was 19 vs when I was 21 just to show you how much can change in two years, but I realized that this sub is basically a safe space for people who don’t want to try and instead just blame remarkable progress on steroids use.</p>

<p>Look, two years is a long time. If you ate a lot and followed a program and stuck to it, you can go from skinny to bulked up like OP. The same thing happened to me when I joined the military. </p>

<p>Also keep in mind that the After photo is taken inside a gym, where OP has a post-gym pump and good lighting. I can guarantee that OP doesn’t look this big when he wakes up, but that’s beside the point.</p>

<p>That you think it’s literally impossible to achieve this naturally says more about you than OP. Just, please, try harder with your diet and workouts.</p>

<div class="md"><p>You know what, after taking into consideration the lighting and pump, i might be inclined to agree with you. Its not easy or highly likely for it to have happened, but it just might be possible. </p>

<p>And im not saying that its an impossible transformation, just that its almost impossible to have happened in 2 years.  Who knows, maybe OP has freak genetics and a crazy amount of food and time to train that allowed him to make the gains.</p>

<div class="md"><p>What discipline do you have? You look like fucking shit? I speak from experience and with amazing genetics(which this guy obviously doesn’t have) this isn’t possible in 2 fucking years you moron.

<div class="md"><p>Why are you so upset? Is a skinny person bulking up to a buff person over the course of <strong>two years</strong> really seem that impossible to you?</p>

<p>Let’s say you met your small younger skinny self today, and they asked how long it will take them to get buff. Not get buff to where you’re at right now, but just to get bigger. <em>Knowing what you know now</em>, you genuinely believe that they can’t get big within two years?</p>

<p>Dude two years is a long time. You see transformations like this in high school sports with athletes when they’re sophomores vs when they’re seniors. How is OP’s transformation “impossible”?</p>

<p>Anyways, I saw your progress pics and congrats on your shredding journey, but it’s so weird that you think OP might be lying. Like come on, it’s not like he went from skinny person to what you look like — he went from skinny person to a dude posting a picture while having a post-gym pump.</p>

<p>They say this isn’t natural because they can’t wrap their mind around a strict discipline. This kind of transformation happens to <em>high school</em> athletes when they do a sport. Think about the skinny sophomores that graduated as buff seniors.</p>
