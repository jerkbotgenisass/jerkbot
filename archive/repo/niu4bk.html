<div class="md"><p>Can someone whos educated about this shit? Is this accurate. Was considering doing my first cut after getting into shape over the last year, cause everyone else is. But it seemed stupid. So I considered a bulk and looked into it as well, also kinda seemed weird. </p>

<p>So is this like the good stuff I&#39;ve been looking for or nah?</p>

<div class="md"><p>Every successful professional bodybuilder ever does the bulk and cut. So, it&#39;s not rocket science, it obviously works really well. </p>

<p>Most people screw it up though, they get too fat in the bulk and barely gain any muscle, so telling them to maingain seems to prevent that.</p>

<div class="md"><p>So do you think i should maintain until I have more mass and a betterly constructed diet and shit so I don&#39;t accidentally ruin my gains in a cut or make myself a fatty again in a bulk</p>

<div class="md"><p>You don’t have to bulk and cut. Maintain and gain is the way. If your looking at fitness in the long run maintaining and gaining should be the way</p>

<div class="md"><p>Seconding dish. Want gains? Eat more. Hard gainers are usually people that get full too easily as well. After you’ve gained significant muscle comes steroids. There’s no need for cut and bulks. Just hypertrophy, rest, and all the protein you can find.</p>

<div class="md"><p>A lot of people overthink this, if you&#39;re a Pro bodybuilder then you can micro manage every calorie, the average dude though doesn&#39;t have the time or effort required to perfect their diet.</p>

<p>I&#39;m a powerlifter so I&#39;m pretty much in a permabulk, weight gain slows down when I hit 110kg but when I&#39;m bigger I use more energy and naturally eat more because I&#39;m hungrier.</p>

<p>If I ever wanted to cut I&#39;d obviously cut calories but try to maintain protein, it&#39;s very important to keep lifting heavy to maintain muscle mass and testosterone levels. You&#39;ll feel like shit in a calorie deficit but you have to keep training or else you&#39;ll lose all your muscle along with the fat, this is what most guys do and it&#39;s what virgin is doing in the meme, it&#39;s why he loses and gains the same 20lbs every year.</p>

<p>Late reply but there it is.</p>

<div class="md"><p>Doing bulking in winter makes you look bigger. People are wearing clothes most of the time. There is more nuance than this.</p>

<div class="md"><p>Can&#39;t hide your fat face in the winter, unless you wear a balaclava 24/7. But I guess it&#39;s just not about physical appearance but also feeling lethargic, spending money on extra groceries etc</p>
