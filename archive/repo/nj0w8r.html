<div class="md"><p>Yeh but it&#39;s just good practice. A 30y probably isn&#39;t going to hurt their back picking up a heavy rock without bending their knees one time.

<p>It&#39;s easier to just pick it up properly and develop good lifelong habits than having to constantly make that judgement call.</p>

<p>There&#39;s no way a heavy rock is the object they&#39;re talking about. It&#39;s usually some large, awkwardly shaped thing that is still light enough for one person to lift in order to tip the more convenient decision of grabbing it while leaning over instead of the safer leg play</p>

<div class="md"><p>It&#39;s not the one off time you do it poorly. It&#39;s the repetitive strain that accumulates from regularly doing it wrong. The more times you do it poorly, the more chances you have to finally cause an injury, whereas if you do it correctly every time regardless you reduce that risk significantly.</p>

<div class="md"><p>I had one of the worst herniated C6-C-7 discs two top neurosurgeons had ever seen, still have the MRI digital images as a reminder. It blew out on the right side impinging a major nerve in my back and down my right arm. My right tricep atrophied away to literally nothing. I’m sure some strand of muscle was still under the loose skin but for all intents and purposes I didn’t have a tricep anymore. I was 2 days away from what both surgeons considered a required spinal fusion procedure. The one where they use donor bone and titanium to fuse the adjacent vertebrae together and hold them there for the rest of my life. The same type of surgery Peyton Manning had some version of 4 times to keep him on the field. I was 30 and years of wrestling and MMA had caused the hernia and finally during a training session I felt the worst pain I’d ever felt in my neck and under my right shoulder blade and lost the use of my right arm. My brain was telling my arm what to do but I couldn’t move it enough to brush my teeth or even sign my name. I was on Percocet as needed daily leading up to the surgery just to function. The last week before the procedure I started to get limited feeling and range of motion back in my arm with less pain. My surgeon canceled the procedure and asked me to come in for a consultation. After another MRI he said it would never be the same but it had somehow callused over retracting from the nerve allowing feeling back into my arm and he wanted to monitor it. I began with extremely light physical therapy which turned into limited targeted weight training for my neck, back and shoulders with no over-the-head lifting. After a few months of training and eating a protein rich diet, I had built up the muscle around the spine and neck to allow my arm and tricep to begin to grow the muscle back. I had to quit MMA for good but eventually regained everything I lost. Some days I feel it more than others but I can still feel it if I turn a certain way or lift without proper form. My trainer was very patient and knew exactly how hard to push me and when to let up on me. I owe my recovery to him, the doctor and not having to undergo a procedure that has a limited and degenerative success rate. I haven’t taken my back or neck for granted a day since that ordeal.</p>

<div class="md"><p>I worked a job 20 years ago that brought in a guy who had an ‘innovative new manual handling system.’ We were all forced to take the course. His system was unique to say the least and I’ve never encountered it before or since that day. </p>

<p>He basically advocated lifting by bending one leg to the side and lifting with that one leg. Imagine pro wrestler Shawn Michaels doing his signature pose. One leg stretched out and the other leg bent taking your weight. Doing that and lifting a box on his way back up. It was bizarre and felt so unnatural. We were ordered to only lift things like this from that point on. It lasted a week before guys started complaining about lower back, knee and hip problems. It was promptly dropped when our employer realised the legal implications of this new system.</p>

<div class="md"><p>Well this video implies that hinging more at the hips and keeping your legs more straight necessarily means you will round your back. It will load your back/hips more sure, but that doesn&#39;t mean you round it, nor does it mean its bad for your back.</p>

<p>Look at the Romanian Deadlift which requires no knee flexion, lots of back loading, straight back though. Also, intentional back flexion in some cases isn&#39;t the end all be all anyways, just look at strongmen lifting atlas stones.</p>
