<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Hello everyone! March 5th was my rest day and I decided to try a ring muscle up and to my shock I did it. I did a few more that day just for fun and the day after I did 6 sets of 2 reps, I was felling so good about myself that I almost posted a vid here, lol.</p>

<p>Now fast forward to today, I can&#39;t seem to get myself up again. I maybe got like a coulpe muscle ups in these 20 days but with terrible form and a lot of faliures and a little elbow pain.</p>

<p>Nothing really changed about my routine, I do ring pull ups and ring dips every workout, I workout 2 days then rest and then workout 2 days again.</p>

<p>The only thing that changed is that I now play soccer/football once a week but why would that matter at all?</p>

<p>My diet is still in check as always so what the hell is going on? Is it possible to go from a 6x2 to 0 like that?</p>

<div class="md"><p>You&#39;ve probably lost the strength round the transition - very common if you stop doing them for a while. My suggestion would be two or three sessions a week incorporating very slow negatives. Do that for three weeks, take a couple of days off then try full ones again - bet you&#39;ll have them back</p>
