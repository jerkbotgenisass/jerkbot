<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>At the time of writing this letter, Bruce was a 21 year old student at University of Washington and as I was reading his letter I became more convinced that he abstained. I mean, he was a martial arts genius.. practicing and studying every part of his body so he must of understood the importance of abstaining to stand out from the rest. Also Bruce&#39;s philosophy was fundamentally Taoist he even wrote a book titled &quot;Tao of Jeet Kune Do&quot;. Google Jeet Kune Do and you can see the big yin yang symbol. I rarely see his name brought up in these discussions but I truly believe he was a retainer.. I feel like in this letter he is explaining the &#39;life force&#39; that is constantly discussed on the path of SR. </p>

<p>&quot;I feel I have this great creative and spiritual force within me that is greater than faith, greater than ambition, greater than confidence, greater than determination, greater than vision. It is all these combined. My brain becomes magnetized with this domination force which I hold in my hand.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Whether it is the God-head or not, I feel this great force, this unstopped power, this dynamic something within me. This feeling defies description, and [there is] no experience with which this feeling may be compared. It is something like a strong emotion mixed with faith, but a lot stronger.&quot;</p>

<p>I love Bruce Lee, he was taken from us too early I can only imagine what he could have accomplished if he wasn&#39;t taken away at only 32. RIP GOAT. </p>

<p>“He was influenced by Taoism therefore he possibly retained, and if he had sex probably it was not frequently. He knew that one of the most important principles to mastering Kung Fu is actually mastering the self (mind/body/spirit), so there’s no way this man enjoyed the passion that lust brings like most of the people do (there’s a lot of Taoist teachings based of the conservation of sexual energy/jing force). Bruce Lee was strong, he was charismatic, he was magnetic, he had this confidence, he was a genius. He knew of course about this unlimited source of energy and transmuted it to project and make his dreams come true” -<a href="/u/emperoresteban">u/emperoresteban</a></p>

<p>&gt;Dear Pearl,<br/>
This letter is hard to understand. It contains my dreams and my ways of thinking, as a whole, you can call it my way of life. It will be rather confusing as it is difficult to write down exactly how I feel. Yet I want to write and let you know about it. I’ll do my best to write it clearly and I hope that you, too, will keep an open mind in this letter, and don’t arrive at any conclusions till you are finished.  </p>

<p>There are two ways of making a good living, one is the result of hard working, and the other, the result of the imagination (requires work, too, of course). It is a fact that labor and thrift produce a competence, but fortune, in the sense of wealth, is the reward of the man who can think of something that hasn’t been thought of before. In every industry, in every profession, ideas are what America is looking for. Ideas have made America what she is, and one good idea will make a man what he wants to be.  </p>

<p>One part of my life is gung fu. This art influences me greatly in the formation of my character and ideas. I practice gung fu as a physical culture, a form of mental training, a method of self-defense, and a way of life. Gung fu is the best of all martial art; yet the Chinese derivatives of judo and karate, which are only basics of gung fu, are flourishing all over the US. This so happens because no one has heard of this supreme art; also there are no competent instructors…I believe my long years of practice back up my title to become the first instructor of this movement. There are yet long years ahead of me to polish my techniques and character. My aim, therefore, is to establish a first Gung Fu Institute that will later spread out all over the US (I have set up a time limit of 10 to 15 years to complete the whole project). My reason in doing this is not the sole objective of making money. The motives are many and among them are: I like to let the world know about the greatness of this Chinese art; I enjoy teaching and helping people; I like to have a well-to-do home for my family; I like to originate something; and the last but yet one of the important is because gung fu is part of myself.<br/>
I know my idea is right, and therefore the results would be satisfactory. I don’t really worry about the reward, but to set in motion the machinery to achieve it. My contribution will be the measure of my reward and success.  </p>

<p>Before he passed away, some asked the late Dr Charles P. Steimetz, the electrical genius, in his opinion “What branch of science would make the most progress in the next twenty-five years?” He paused and thought for several minutes then like a flash replied, “spiritual realization.” When a man comes to a conscious vital realization of those great spiritual forces within himself and begins to use those forces in science, in business and in life, his progress in the future will be unparalleled.  </p>

<p>I feel I have this great creative and spiritual force within me that is greater than faith, greater than ambition, greater than confidence, greater than determination, greater than vision. It is all these combined. My brain becomes magnetized with this domination force which I hold in my hand.  </p>

<p>When you drop a pebble into a pool of water, the pebble starts a series of ripples that expand until they encompass the whole pool. This is exactly what will happen when I give my ideas a definite plan of action. Right now, I can project my thoughts into the future, I can see ahead of me. I dream (remember that practical dreamers never quit). I may now own nothing but a little place down in basement, but once my imagination has got up to a full head of steam, I can see painted on a canvas of my mind a picture of a fine, big five or six story Gung Fu Institute with branches all over the States. I am not easily discouraged, readily visualize myself as overcoming obstacles, winning out over setbacks, achieving “impossible” objectives.  </p>

<p>Whether it is the God-head or not, I feel this great force, this unstopped power, this dynamic something within me. This feeling defies description, and [there is] no experience with which this feeling may be compared. It is something like a strong emotion mixed with faith, but a lot stronger.  </p>

<p>All in all, the goal of my planning and doing is to find the true meaning in life — peace of mind. I know that the sum of all the possessions I mentioned does not necessarily add up to peace of mind; however, it can be if I devote [my energy] to real accomplishment of self rather than neurotic combat. In order to achieve this peace of mind, the teaching of detachment of Taoism and Zen proved to be valuable….  </p>

<p>Probably, people will say I’m too conscious of success. Well, I am not. You see, my will to do springs from the knowledge that I CAN DO. I’m only being natural, for there is no fear or doubt inside my mind.<br/>
Pearl, success comes to those who become success-conscious. If you don’t aim at an object, how the heck on earth do you think you can get it?<br/>
Warm regards,<br/>
Bruce</p>

<div class="md"><p>He clearly abstained from jacking off unlike your average male in today’s society, you don’t need to hear it from his mouth to believe it. And since he also followed Taoism there’s even a greater chance that he cultivated his sexual energy.</p>

<div class="md"><p>I&#39;ll add some info here as a huge Bruce Lee fan who&#39;s read many books on the man. This comment may appear negative but it&#39;s not meant to be so. Again I&#39;m a massive Bruce Lee fan and in fact I find actually knowing how he truly was (not a glossed image) in fact makes him more relatable.</p>

<p>I believe Bruce was potentially a retainer at this age of 21.  That or at least he was so focused on what he wanted to an almost exclusive degree, that it basically outweighed any other desires he had. He even expressed to one of his early girlfriends called Amy Sanbo, that he wanted to find a woman to &#39;support him in pursuit of his dreams&#39;. The relationship didn&#39;t work out but ultimately this role was fulfilled by Linda Lee, who absolutely became this if you know anything about their marriage. So without reducing it too much, even his romantic interest weren&#39;t really that important to him so long as it served his end.</p>

<p>I believe some people have this drive as it explains men like Conor McGregor&#39;s success who I don&#39;t believe is a retainer either and they&#39;re just naturally focused and don&#39;t have too many &#39;leaks in the bucket&#39;, in terms of distracting behaviours that drain the life force. There&#39;s just some people who have a desire so strong that they can do it without retaining for long periods. However one big caveat there! Their desire is so strong so they are working toward that and so focused on it that they&#39;re NOT even thinking about wasting their essence on porn or hookups which are ultimately a coping mechanism for an unfulfilling life. It&#39;s just sexual energy transmutation basically and that desire is so &#39;burning&#39; (Napoleon Hill), in their mind that it takes almost their entire focus and crowds out any other ideas.</p>

<p>But for others and many on this forum, that&#39;s not the case. I&#39;m not sure why this is, but I believe it comes down to life experiences/beliefs at the core, because before any benefits gained by SR there is the mind that everything stems from. However, this is for another discussion because we can&#39;t logically claim that SR is the only way because there are so many examples of successful men who didn&#39;t retain and still attained insane heights - Arnold Schwarzenegger etc.</p>

<p>Some extra things to mention though that are very important. When Bruce started to become successful (potentially before) he begun to have mistresses outside of his marriage to Linda. The first documented case of this was &#39;Thordis Brandt&#39;, when bruce worked on &#39;The Green Hornet&#39;. Bruce pursued and seduced her, which is documented in the incredible book &#39;Bruce Lee: A Life&#39; by Matthew Polly, which I highly recommend. Bruce also didn&#39;t inform Thordis he was married. She found out through a private detective and was devastated.</p>

<p>This is by no means a slanderous book either, it&#39;s actually very complimentary of Bruce and incredibly well researched. However, it doesn&#39;t shy away from the man he truly was and present him as an angelic deity that he&#39;s since been branded in order to continue his legacy and sell merchandise. He even gained a nickname in the Hong Kong media as &#39;three leg lee&#39; referring to his escapades with various women.</p>

<p>Bruce actually fell unconscious, and died in Betty Ting Pei&#39;s bed. It was an open secret at the time that Betty was his girlfriend and was described as such by people that knew him and had expressed to him that it wasn&#39;t fair to his wife and child to be so open about his relationship with Betty.</p>

<p>This is where my own theory comes into the mix, and of course these are just my opinions.</p>

<p>When he began to become famous, Bruce began having massive anxiety and began chewing Jamaican hash to cope with. He became paranoid and even started carrying a gun around with him describing himself as &#39;a monkey in a zoo&#39;. He was also described as becoming aloof in various social situations and like he wasn&#39;t really there - he was physically but there were things on his mind constantly troubling him. There&#39;s actually an interview with Jackie Chan floating around somewhere in which he speaks about the last time he ever saw Bruce. He  describes Bruces bizarre behaviour and responses in their conversation.</p>

<p>This of course could be blamed on numerous things like the pressure of becoming famous, his immense physical training , the hash etc which I&#39;m sure all played a role... But the correlation is this anxiety began around the time when he began to have the mistresses and I believe, largely as a result began spilling his seed more frequently and starting to lose his focus. Especially as it was with numerous partners. This is something I have fallen victim to in the past, before discovering SR and there&#39;s something about it that is just bad for the soul and it erodes your character. As if you&#39;re taking on the energy of so many different people.</p>

<p>Bruce was still very driven to succeed, but the more I read about him a pattern becomes clear that he was a much happier man in his earlier life, when he was just training with friends in Seattle and Oakland California. This was the time that he had massive desire to achieve his  dreams and didn&#39;t have the temptation that came with becoming famous. Now imagine coupling that with the possibility that if he was a retainer - the magnetic and attractive quality it brings to ones character.</p>

<p>Again my theory only, but it seems as if this time like for many men in history, became his downfall. I&#39;m certainly not linking this completely to his death, but there&#39;s way to know about happenings before his death rather than &#39;he just dropped dead at age 32&#39;. Things like he was having frequent blackouts for a few months before as well as many other health challenges. One of which being his back injury, which he largely ignored and used heavy pain medication to subdue so he could continue. There&#39;s one thing that&#39;s perseverance, but then it can be taken too far. There are quite a few incidents like this to learn about in his life in which he seemed to push back too hard against the direction life was taking him. This especially with the back injury, which seemed to be nature&#39;s way of attempting to slow him down, at least temporarily.</p>

<p>What I think happened ultimately is that he potentially used retention (unconsciously) or at least ejaculated very infrequently due to his focus and unconscious use of sexual transmutation in order to &#39;call in&#39;/ create all of these wonderful things in his life. He had fuel in the lamp in order to be able to handle all of this coming at him... for a time. But that was until he began to succumb to the temptations that fame brought and began losing his essence. Unfortunately though he had created this massive reality and huge pressure on himself, but was now in a  weaker state than when had created it... Leading to the huge anxiety and use of hash etc. He had initially lit the flame, but then ran out of oil in the lamp in order to sustain it.</p>

<p>Again this is just my theory and I&#39;d be interested to know others opinions on it. The man was incredible, continues to inspire generations decades after his passing and had a drive that was unmatched, but he was still a human being with flaws.</p>

<p>Someone else also mentioned about Napoleon Hill&#39;s book and if Bruce read it, which he absolutely did and even wrote out a &#39;Definite Chief Aim&#39; statement, as the book suggests which is easily located via a google search</p>

<div class="md"><p>This is really interesting and absolutely relevant. I agree that &#39;hungry bruce&#39; was much more driven, less distracted and spiritually invested than &#39;Hollywood bruce&#39;.</p>

<p>I think you are spot on that towards the end he was definitely spilling more of his seed with various women and its a side to him that the bruce lee foundation neatly sweep under the carpet, lionising him as a martial arts demi god who was spiritually beyond reproach.</p>

<p>He wasn&#39;t. He was flawed just like any other human being and its interesting that after he had been seduced fully by the west that the affluence and media attention actually completely changed his focus, and the more egoic side came to the fore.</p>

<div class="md"><p>Completely agree! The use of the hash/pain meds for the back etc is certainly not being like water and flowing. It&#39;s the opposite - resisting what is. </p>

<p>That&#39;s another thing that has become clear about Bruce, the more I learn is that he didn&#39;t really live many of the things he liked to preach about, rather he just popularised them. But you&#39;ll know that from Polly&#39;s book already. I shall also be revisiting it.</p>

<p>Have you read &#39;Unsettled Matters&#39;? Now that is one that is very questionable in terms of sources and information, but also contains some interesting stuff.</p>

<div class="md"><p>&#39;Before the hash and the women&#39; 🤣🤣</p>

<p>I couldn&#39;t say man honestly, however one thing I do think he did very well in his later years, was reinvent his self completely to the person he truly wanted to be. He even stated that he &#39;wasn&#39;t being Bruce Lee&#39; on the set of the Green Hornet, because he was too inhibited and uptight.  </p>

<p>I think it&#39;s a testament to his character that he was able to observe that within himself and completely change it. Just look at that old, short interview that recently surfaced of him riding that bike on the set of the Green Hornet, he can barely look the host in the eye. Then compare that to the Pierre Burton show interview a few years later. It&#39;s like a completely different person!</p>

<div class="md"><p>Interesting insight on Bruce&#39;s life I definitely agree with you, Hollywood possibly swayed him away from the righteous path. Don&#39;t forget he was only 32 when he passed, there was still so much time for him to reflect and grow.. What a shame, RIP GOAT.</p>

<div class="md"><p>Did he practice SR?</p>

<p>Its possible.</p>

<p>Was it written that practiced SR in any known book?</p>

<p>I&#39;ve just finished 3 books on bruce inc matthew pollys, no mention at all.</p>

<p>And yet charisma, energy, Magnetism are words splashed across the pages.</p>

<p>He was known as a child to be highly energetic and was taught tai chi by his father</p>

<p>When asked about this by john saxon later in life, bruce said tai chi was &#39;a head trip&#39;.</p>

<p>Interesting choice of words that.</p>

<p>Its probable that SR was the secret sauce for Bruce Lee&#39;s essence?</p>

<p>Sure, its an interesting hypothesis, and one that demands further investigation.</p>

<p>Perhaps we should petition Shannon Lee for an answer?</p>

<div class="md"><p>Exactly what it seems like. He sounds like someone who just finished reading the book and is excited about it. </p>

<p>There is a chapter on sexual transmutation so I wonder if he followed that too... I know he did have sex, but not so sure about his younger days</p>

<div class="md"><p>He was a Taoist therefore a Retainer , and if he had sex probably it was not frequently , he knew that one of the most important principles to mastering Kung Fu it’s actually mastering the self (Mind/Body/Spirit) , so there’s no way this man enjoyed the passion that lust brings like most of the people do (there’s a lot of Taoist teachings based of the conservation of sexual energy/ jing force btw). Bruce lee was strong , he was charismatic , he was magnetic , he had this confidence, he was a genius. He knew of course about this unlimited source of energy and transmuted it to project and make his dreams and come true. YES this dude WAS ALMOST TOTAL CELIBATE. </p>

<p>JUST WATCH A FEW VIDEOS OF HIM BEING INTERVIEWED AND YOU CAN SEE THERES SOMETHING UNUSUAL ABOUT HIM...</p>

<div class="md"><p>Do your own, he was a bad boy who trained a bit in wing chun kung fu. That&#39;s all. His mentality was bad when he was young, nothing related to a taoist.</p>

<div class="md"><p>He wrote a book titled &quot;Tao of Jeet Kune Do&quot; and yes the &#39;Do&#39; in JKD actually refers to the Chinese character &quot;道&quot; which = Tao. Even if he wasn&#39;t a full on Taoist he was definitely influenced by it. Who are you to say he was just a bad boy who trained a bit in wing chun? Wtf? His mentality was bad when he was young and you assume he never grew out of it?</p>

<p>Google Jeet Kune Do and look at the big ass YinYang symbol and tell me he was not influenced by Taoism at all.</p>

<div class="md"><p>He practiced tai chi, his father taught him and I would think it must have included some taoist knowledge to underpin the techniques.</p>

<p>He also majored in philosophy, and taoism was undoubtedly the springboard to that. </p>

<div class="md"><p>It&#39;s a common chinese symbol and it&#39;s meaning is famous in Asia. The title of his book mean it&#39;s his phylosophy of Jeet Kune Do, not he is a taoist lol.</p>

<p>There is even a taoist monk pics in the book, this don&#39;t mean he was a monk lol. I like phylosophy, but I am not a philosopher...</p>

<p>Without proof, you can&#39;t affirm he was.</p>

<div class="md"><p>I never said he was a full on Taoist, he definitely took influence from Taoism hence the practice of TaiChi at an early age and application of Taoist philosophy in Jeet Kune Do, just like the hundreds of other martial arts he took influence from.</p>

<p>And the yin yang symbol holds its roots to Taoism you don’t just 
see the symbol every where in China like it’s the national flag lmao.</p>
