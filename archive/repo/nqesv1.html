<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I&#39;m so sick of this. This is the second time second day in a row when a female has the audacity (NO MALES ARE STUPID ENOUGH TO DO THIS SHIT) --where some FEMALE waives her hands in my face or points to some piece of equipment im clearly NOT USING JUST for her to ask me if it&#39;s OK to grab it. I&#39;m tired of this just fucking GRAB it if I&#39;m not using it which should be obvious to you if I&#39;m not using it. I don&#39;t own the fucking plates just fucking GRAB the plate you need and move along. No one and I repeat NO ONE does this shit but females I&#39;ve seen do this to me (AND IM A FEMALE) SO STOP DOING THIS. ITS AGGRAVATING to get interrupted while I&#39;m concentrating just for your inconsiderate and disrespectful ass to interject my workset (you dont even wait for me to be resting, your stupid ass just interrupts me while I have a weight over my head) just to ask if you can use equipment. YOU CAN OBVIOUSLY USE IT if it&#39;s one of the following: on a rack for anyone to grab (DUUHHRRRRRRR), abandoned on the gym floor somewhere where no one else is at (WOW). I did not feel the need to rant until it happened on multiple occasions. DO NOT INTERRUPT OTHERS WHILE THEY&#39;RE HANDLING A WEIGHT OVER THEIR FACE. For fucks sake.</p>

<p>Oh yes, yes they ARE, I assure you. Just because no mAlEs have done it to you yet doesn&#39;t mean it doesn&#39;t happen.</p>

<p>Here&#39;s <a href="https://aloftyexistence.wordpress.com/2011/07/18/male-identified-woman/">a little light reading for you.</a></p>

<div class="md"><p>Worth the read if anyone is interested. Glad I’ve been working out at home for the time being. Shouldn’t interrupt anyone no matter the weight or difficulty.</p>
