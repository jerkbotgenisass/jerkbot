Is it possible to reach and maintain a soccer player-like physique with just running and BWF?

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I&#39;m not interested in body building or large muscles. I prefer a lean, slim look (<a href="https://i.imgur.com/pLorL3F.jpg">example</a>; ideally the player on the left, but that looks significantly harder, so I want to at least achieve the guy on the right&#39;s physique).</p>

<p>I&#39;m 180cm (5&#39;11&quot;) and 68kg (150 pounds), but I haven&#39;t worked out in years, so even though I might look relatively fit when wearing clothes, it&#39;s all fat and no muscles underneath. I have a belly and my biceps/triceps flop around lol.</p>

<p>I just started <a href="https://reddit.com/r/bodyweightfitness/comments/kofo8l/bwf_primer_buildup_community_event_day_1_happy/">this BWF Primer Build-up</a> and I can barely do 5x5 pushups. I intend to alternate 14 days with running between every workout (or should I do both every day?). I&#39;ve also started to eat a lot more healthy the past week. Does this plan look like something that will achieve my goals?</p>

<div class="md"><p>I&#39;ll definitely add swimming, thanks for that. I used to love swimming as a kid, but somewhere along the line, I just stopped lol.</p>

<div class="md"><p>Yes and keep at it. The physique on the right is very achievable. Many who don‚Äôt even work out have that physique. The physique on the left is also achievable but will be harder to work for.</p>

<div class="md"><p>purely out of curiosity, if I want to graduate from the right to the left, what sort of effort am I looking at? I know athletes train several hours most days, but I obviously don&#39;t need the sport skills as I&#39;m just looking for fitness.</p>

<div class="md"><p>Consistent workouts atleast 3 x a week, progressive overload. Workout 45 min-1hour30mins each day. The physique on the left would just take more time doing the same thing IMO to achieve. You said you got some fat so Diet would be the driving force with that. I bet if you lose the fat you could look like the right maybe even with no training.</p>

<div class="md"><p>Soccer player train for hours for cardio mostly which helps with helps if you don&#39;t want to diet hard but it doesn&#39;t do much for your physique...

<div class="md"><p>Totally achievable and maintainable without lifting a single weight. But you have to keep at it. Consistency is key to maintain that physique. I am somewhere in between the two players. My Trapezius isn&#39;t developed as much and my core isn&#39;t either on the sides but the sixpack is showing and my body overall is well toned.</p>

<p>I run 1-2x per week and exercise 1-3x per week. I use a pull up bar and a set of gymnastic rings. No special exercise regiment, just the usual BWF/calisthenics approach. for upper body: pull ups on the bar, pike push ups with elevated legs, rows and push ups with rings, tricep extensions; for the core: hollow body holds and reverse hyper; for the legs: bulgarian split squads + nordic curls + calf raises.</p>

<p>also occasionally doing some side planks and stretches for more flexibility.</p>

<p>most of these exercises have a somewhat endless progression, if you are into that and may require weights at some point. I aim for handstand pushups instead of pike pushups, weighted pull ups, archer/weighted push ups etc.</p>

<p>I can&#39;t comment much on the BWF primer but it seems to be suited for beginners, so just do that and see how your body develops. It&#39;s probably said somewhere in there but always aim for quality reps/technique. That will get you a long way and is much better than bad technique and higher quantities of reps/sets.</p>

<div class="md"><p>Just to add to everything here-- remember to work on progressions. It&#39;s ok to not be able to do many pushups all of a sudden, you have to look at it from a different perspective.</p>

<p>Imagine you just step on a gym for the first time. Would you go to the barbells and try to lift 200+ kg? Of course not. You would start with almost no weight, and then slowly progress over time.</p>

<p>Bodyweight excercises (like the ones on the primer) are just like that. Of course, you cannot see any weights, so you have to adapt them by using different versions of the excercise. For example, if you cannot do push ups, do wall push ups or incline push ups. Every bodyweight excercise has progressions that you can follow. Find something that works for you, keep at it, and you&#39;ll see improvement. Good luck! ;)</p>

<div class="md"><p>Guy on the right looks like average skinny-fat dude, who barely exercises. The left guy&#39;s physique is easily achievable in 6 months - 1 year. Just buy rings, set of dumbells for legs (2x20kg is perfect), and start doing Recommended routine (or similar program).  Eat enough protein for muscles to grow. I would say you need to be 73-75kg to look like that guy (with low body fat)</p>
