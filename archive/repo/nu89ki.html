<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I made a video elaborating on the contents of this post, if you prefer to watch that rather than read the write up click <a href="https://youtu.be/kKYBvJho4lE">here</a>.
Contrary to popular belief, the overwhelming majority of joint pain does not have a clear relationship to tissue damage. This is shown quite clearly in this review <a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_lookup?title=Dead%20men%20and%20radiologists%20don%27t%20lie%3A%20a%20review%20of%20cadaveric%20and%20radiological%20studies%20of%20rotator%20cuff%20tear%20prevalence&amp;author=P%20Reilly&amp;author=I%20Macleod&amp;author=R%20Macfarlane&amp;author=J%20Windley&amp;author=RJ.%20Emery&amp;publication_year=2006&amp;journal=Ann%20R%20Coll%20Surg%20Engl&amp;volume=88&amp;pages=116-21#d=gs_qabs&amp;u=%23p%3DzbxsaYgXhOkJ">paper</a>. In line with this knowledge I believe I&#39;ve narrowed the true cause of virtually all shoulder pain to muscle weakness in three muscle groups that aid in shoulder stabilization. Namely these are the rhomboids/lower traps, rear deltoid, and serratus anterior. Like all muscles that connect to any joint, these muscles regulate shoulder joint alignment by something of a tug of war, where each muscle group&#39;s resting tension pulls on a joint and contributes to its final resting posture. I posit that if one or more of these muscles is too weak to match the relative tension of the others, then joint alignment is thrown off, and dysfunction arises seemingly independent of the joint&#39;s underlying structure. Operating under this assumption I&#39;ve managed to permanently cure the long term chronic shoulder pain of over a dozen people, many of whom physical therapy failed to treat, using nothing more than reverse shrugs, rear delt raises, and scapula protraction push ups. It&#39;s important to note that the exercises relevant to your pain must be progressively overloaded and trained to failure, otherwise there will be no benefit.</p>

<p>In order to diagnose which weakness might be causing your shoulder issue you can use a very simple method I discovered. With an understanding of the resting tension model of joint alignment, a muscle&#39;s resting tension can be temporarily increased by fatiguing it and causing it to swell with blood. This allows one to deduce muscle weaknesses simply by performing an exercise that targets that muscle, and then testing shoulder pain immediately afterwards. If the pain has been reduced then you can safely confirm that weakness in the trained muscle is causing your issue. Furthermore, because stronger muscles generate more resting tension permanently, progressing the same exercise will cure the pain permenantly by strengthening the weak muscle.</p>

<p>Stretching and foam rolling by contrast operate with an opposite effect on tension. Stretching temporarily reduces the resting tension of overdeveloped muscle groups, reducing pain by momentarily re-aligning the joint. However  because this effect is so short lived, it is simply not worth doing in most cases. There can be long term benefits of stretching for joint pain, but only if it&#39;s poorly executed. Accidentally stretching a weak muscle regularlyÂ may in some cases cause it to strengthen in response to resisting the stretch. This effect is highly inefficient in comparison to exercise which accomplishes this directly, but I believe this limited success has misleadingly popularized the necessity of stretching and foam rolling for joint pain.</p>

<p>This model if joint pain has generated fairly remarkable results in practice. Because early strength gain occurs so rapidly, many people have no pain or symptoms after only 2 weeks of intensly training their weak muscle. Fascinatingly I have observed this being the case even in people whose chronic shoulder pain had persisted for multiple years prior. I also believe that this model neatly addresses two major issues in the modern approach to joint health. First it addresses the aforementioned struggle in orthopedic research to concretely associate joint anomalies and damage to dysfunction, and it also explains the widespread prevalence of chronic joint pain among humans from an evolutionary perspective. As animals, it simply does not make sense that our bodies are as physically fragile as the mainstream view implies, our ancestors simply would not have made it into the technological era has that been the case. Also, while trauma can certainly be accounted for by evolution&#39;s design of animal joint integrity, weakness and disuse certainly can not be. Weakness is a luxury offered only to humans in the modern era, and this mismatch between our evolutionary history and our modern environment perfectly accounts for the prevalence of joint pain in the modern world.</p>

<p>I hope this information is useful to anyone dealing with joint pain, and I hope it is received with an open mind. I would love to discuss these ideas with anyone who wants to engage with them. I&#39;ve also used this model of pain to  to also cure crippling back, neck and elbow pain in the people I&#39;ve coached, and I&#39;d be more then happy to elaborate on those issues in future posts.</p>

<p>Edit: As many reacted to this post with hostility, I encourage anyone with chronic shoulder pain and a distrust of what I&#39;ve put forward to attempt rehab as I explain in the video and report back. I&#39;m more than open to my approach being falsified by experiment as means of refining it further. If anyone wishes to do so and finds my instructions too unclear, I would be more than happy to keep in touch through the whole process until the pain is relieved, or it becomes obvious that my approach is ineffective. I will even add the caveat that I consider my method to be ineffective if it fails to markedly reduce chronic  shoulder pain within a week of training as I described.</p>

<div class="md"><p>Pain has a weak relationship with tissue damage because pain is a multifactorial, biopsychosocial issue. What evidence do you have that this muscular balance theory would explain shoulder pain?  </p>

<p>Also, I don&#39;t think there&#39;s any evidence to show that stretching or foam rolling reduce pain by temporarily realigning the joint- prove me wrong. Sensorimotor gating is a much better explanation.</p>

<div class="md"><p>Perhaps I&#39;m wrong on the mechanism, but it&#39;s at least close enough for me to virtually always cure long term chronic injuries and predict their causes. The reason I argue for alignment is that I&#39;ve clearly seen peoples resting posture change after following these rehab exercises, both temporarily after a set and permenantly after progressively overloading the movements long term. Sensorimotor gating would also fail to explain the changes people experience following stretching or foam rolling wherein a joint literally feels more easy to articulate. I have personally witnessed many cases in myself and others where a shoulder feels as though it is catching in it&#39;s own internal structures as it&#39;s being rotated, only for these feelings to completely go away following stretching, foam rolling, or appropriate exercise.</p>

<p>I should add also add that science isn&#39;t the pursuit of fact, it&#39;s the pursuit of useful approximations. I am almost certainly wrong, but I&#39;m close enough to have great utility. The sensorimotor model has much less predictive and curative potential then what I&#39;m advocating for. Thus in my mind, it is a far less useful approximation.</p>

<p>Edit: I&#39;d also like to point out that describing things being high multivariate is often a cop out for a poor understanding of the underlying mechanism. Things get simpler when closer to the truth not more complex. Joint integrity maintenance has to be simple enough for a prehistoric human not to fuck up. These overly complex models simply dont account for that.</p>

<p>This is absolutely and completely false.<br/>
Science literally means knowledge or &#39;to know&#39;, and approximating is what we do when we <em>don&#39;t</em> know.  </p>

<p>Please think about this further and perhaps reframe your thoughts and methods. You do you, but you don&#39;t get to change reality.</p>

<div class="md"><p>You are clearly fighting a straw man. Strong is very subjective. Can a 500 pound bencher experience shoulder pain? Certainly. Would he experience the same pain if his rear delts and serratus were much stronger? I doubt it. </p>

<p>Also what&#39;s your explanation? Have you fixed chronic shoulder pain in a very &quot;strong&quot; person? What utility does your understanding of the issue actually produce?</p>

<div class="md"><p>Loading it is fine, but to have so little understanding of what pain is that you think a bit of extra strength is going to cure all shoulder pain because you &#39;coached&#39; a couple of people is the embodiment of the dunning kruger effect.</p>

<div class="md"><p>To manipulate and predict something is as close to an understanding as the scientific method can produce. If you lack such an understanding, but confidently rejoice at your ignorance, then the effect much more greatly reflects you than me. Have you watched the video? Relative strength across all muscles maintains joint integrity. &quot;A little bit of strength&quot; in the right muscle groups is all it usually takes to fix a glaring weakpoint, particularly because undertrained muscles adapt very quickly to direct training.</p>

<div class="md"><p>Great stuff! Noticed this with my knees and ankles cuz I used to play soccer from like age 5-17 but I never paired practice with gym workouts (all we did was run, kick and some push ups/sit ups rarely). Had lots of âoveruseâ pain in my knees and ankles which kept me on the sidelines most of high school. Began working out in the gym senior year after a hip avulsion, and I havenât had any sporadic pain in my knees or ankles since. Wish I had started going to the gym earlier to be able to actually play but it is what it is. </p>

<p>Love your point about how humans arenât really fragile, itâs just that we live in a world where we weaken. Was just talking bout this with a friend the other day. Although I do think some ppl are more injury prone than others, would you agree?</p>

<div class="md"><p>Yeah I&#39;m fairly certain most &quot;overuse&quot; injuries are really just undiagnosed weaknesses, and that people  can tolerate very high training volumes so long as weak muscles are kept up to snuff. My findings have been that &quot;injury prone&quot; people tend to just have terrible posture due to some external life circumstance, like occupation. Such postural issues tend to contribute to the development of weaknesses, that end up later manifesting as seeming injury prone.</p>

<p>Edit: intended to make a claim about most overuse injuries being misdiagnosed muscle weaknesses in opposing muscle groups, not all as I originally stated.</p>

<div class="md"><p>I want to start by saying that overuse injuries are absolutely a thing, especially in high level, overhead athletes. That being said, this is basically one aspect of the bare bones, underlying theory of physical therapy: strengthen the weak and painful muscles. Speaking as a physical therapist, Iâm quite disappointed PT failed those people, but glad you were able to help.</p>

<div class="md"><p>I did speak too generally I admit, they are certainly a thing in my experience, however the majority of overuse injuries seem to simply be poorly diagnosed relative muscle weaknesses.
