<p>Running, contrary to what many people think, is not the best way to lose weight. My name is Stepan Gromov and now I will tell you why</p>

<p>Running is the most popular exercise for those who have decided to start a new life on Monday, every person when they decide to improve their shape a little, if they were not previously interested in the topic of fitness, goes running.</p>

<p>And in principle, running is an excellent component of any training program, but is it so effective if we want to get rid of excess weight, and to be specific - from fat. Because you can lose weight in different ways, for example, drink a laxative, but I think it will not give us the effect we so fiercely desire. Therefore, it is necessary to burn exactly fat</p>

<p>There are nuances here, the most important thing is that a change in a person&#39;s body weight should first of all be accompanied by a change in the total caloric content of his diet. We want to lose weight – we need to eat less, everything is iron and unshakable. But in order to lose weight due to fat, and not due to the muscles burn, because in fact, they will first start burning on a calorie deficit-you will have to think a little first, and then act.</p>

<p>Fat is located under the skin, or near the internal organs, energy during training, running, and even sitting on the couch is needed quickly, that is, here and now:</p>

<p>when we push-ups-energy is needed in the muscles of the chest, shoulders and triceps, when we squat-in the muscles of legs and so on, but the fat is under the skin in the form of huge jelly-like masses, it can be converted into energy quickly enough, but to deliver this energy to the muscles for use during work, it will take much more time</p>

<p>To deliver fat from under the skin to the muscles, you need to drive it through the entire circulatory system, because the blood is the main transport structure in our body, covering all its parts – this is actually one of its main functions-the transport of substances</p>

<p>In order for the fat to seep into the blood, it must be broken down, because such a large piece of our fullness will not fit into the blood vessels with all the desire. And so it turns out that in order to get energy from fat, we need to break it down, run it through the bloodstream and send it to the working muscles, which is also not easy, because right now they are busy with other things</p>

<p>This is the main reason why fat is not burned during any physical activity, there is simply not enough time for it, and for this purpose internal muscle energy sources are used, which are located right inside the muscle cells and are already ready to receive energy from them</p>

<p>And this also explains that training on the abs will not burn fat on the stomach, and training the tongue will not make the cheeks narrower,</p>

<p>Fat is stored where it is anatomically more convenient to be located on your body, it still has to make a way through the entire body through the bloodstream</p>

<p>For example, the stomach is the most sedentary part of the body of men, where extra kgmms will not interfere in any way, for girls it is the hips, because suddenly there will be a need to give birth to children, then the excess mass in the abdominal area will definitely not be useful</p>

<p>Studies on the topic of fat burning during training say that in order for fat to start burning, you need to run for at least an hour without stopping, then almost all intramuscular sources will be exhausted and you will need alternative more backup batteries</p>

<p>But let&#39;s be honest – running for more than an hour is quite difficult and not many people are able to withstand such a training regime</p>

<p>And to tell the truth-it is far from a fact that all this fat that has been broken down into fatty acids and sent into the bloodstream will not be absorbed back home under the skin and again will not be stuck in the extra centimeters of your waist, because it is not a fact that you will be able to use up the energy that you have been provided with fat after an hour of running training</p>

<p>What should we do with this information now?</p>

<p>And nothing, you need to train for weight loss in a strength style for all muscle groups, then you will exhaust all intramuscular energy sources during training and keep active cell mass-muscles that will help you spend more energy and therefore facilitate the process of your weight loss, and then at night – when you go to bed, the body will have a lot of time to replenish these reserves using the accumulation of your fat, and strength training will make your fat burn, but not your muscles VERY IMPORTANT – only when you are on a kilocalorie deficit, because otherwise your organism will not need to touch the fat, since the reserves can be replenished from the cake that you ate at dinner</p>

<p>Therefore, high-quality strength training, kilocalorie deficiency– this is what you need</p>

<p>And if you still want to run, then remember that the fat begins to burn after about an hour after the start of the workout</p>

<p>And it does not burn without a trace, it is only broken down into fatty acids and enters the bloodstream</p>

<p>It&#39;s likely to be absorbed back under the skin, but the free fatty acids in the blood are the perfect source of energy for low-intensity aerobic cardio - for running</p>

<p>Take a ten-minute running at the end of your strength training, so you will get the most ideal fat burning option during it</p>

<p>And that&#39;s it, approach your workouts wisely, eat right and remember that you are the best</p>

<p>It was Stepan Gromov, see you</p>

<p>Please go read a textbook. Like, a basic physiology one, or a nutrition one, or maybe a middle school biology one? Your body burns fat <em>all the dang time</em>, including when you&#39;re active and when you&#39;re asleep. </p>

<p>Studies absolutely do not say that. Where are you getting your information?</p>

<div class="md"><p>This is what happens when a person has not read anything except the school textbook)) During exercise - fat is the last source of energy that the body touches. A surplus of 500 kcal - you say subcutaneous fat will always burn?!)) About the fact that fat burns at night - I wrote it myself, do not manipulate</p>

<p>I can give you some advice - read something other than the school curriculum))</p>

<p>PS</p>

<p>&quot;Studies absolutely do not say that.&quot; Where are you getting your information?)))</p>

<div class="md"><p>Fatty acid metabolism during exercise is well studied. A textbook would explain it to you in basic terms so that you could begin to understand the subject you are trying to explain to others. You simply do not have your basic facts right. </p>

<p>The body always burns fat. It uses glycogen as an additional energy source during more intense exercise. <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s42255-020-0251-4">Here is an article that may help you understand a bit better</a>, especially figure 3.</p>

<div class="md"><p>Genius)))This figure does not contradict in any way what I wrote.</p>

<p>Fatty acids burn - yes, especially at low intensity loads!!! I wrote about this, and tried to convey it to you in the comments.</p>

<p>Fatty acids are not subcutaneous fat, and you know it, and know about what I told</p>

<p>You just pour sources and factsand and manipulate words to protect your ego. (&quot;you could begin to understand the subject you are trying to explain to others&quot; - serious?!))))</p>

<p>Friend, you have nothing to catch here))</p>

<div class="md"><p>I use Russian-language editions</p>

<p>But here everything is quite lucidly described.</p>

<p><a href="https://runnersconnect.net/energy-systems-running/">https://runnersconnect.net/energy-systems-running/</a></p>

<p>&quot;In <strong>prolonged</strong> activities where <strong>intensity is low</strong>, the body will use <strong>fat</strong> as a main energy source and spare the use of muscle <strong>glycogen and blood glucose</strong> so that it is available for use if exercise intensity increases and oxygen availability is decreased.&quot;</p>

<p>And here it is talking about free fatty acids, not subcutaneous fat</p>

<p>Firtsly - free fatty acids, glycogen and glucose (and also amino acids and ATP molecules), and only then, when the workout becomes <strong>prolonged</strong> - a little subcutaneous fat</p>

<p>And if anything, I stop this dialogue. The opponent defends himself, not the truth. To those whom you could mislead - I described everything. There is no point, desire and time to persuade you</p>
