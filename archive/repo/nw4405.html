<p>Post edit either everyone here is old or teenagers are now being born old. Here&#39;s hoping we all have Benjamin button disease and get fit as we age :D</p>

<div class="md"><p>I snapped my ankle when I was a teen and broke it again in my early 20s, I&#39;m 29 now and it is constantly giving me grief. I hate thinking of growing old and breaking it again because it was hard enough to bounce back when I was younger, let alone in a decade or so. But I got a life to live and can&#39;t let it hold me back from doing g fun stuff like hiking and diving</p>

<div class="md"><p>I was running up my stairs and basically kicked the stair so hard it nearly folded my left foot in half, toes to heel. Had to get a boot and crutches. Dr was amazed nothing was broken but it was a baad sprain. Later that same week I was at a restaurant that had one step down to the seating area. Not being a professional crutches user yet, I misjudged the distance and came down wrong on my right foot rolling the crap out of my ankle. Unable to put weight on the left foot, crutches went flying and I landed on my face. Both feet out of comission now, I had to be carried out. Back to the Drs for an ankle brace. Crippled is how I decided to enter my 30s...</p>

<div class="md"><p>I did the same thing. I had just snapped my achilles on one side and then tried to go down a flight of stairs while on crutches and too much painkillers. I high centred on my crutches and took a header down the first flight, missed the landing and smashed into a chair at the bottom of the second. The chair saved my other ankle though, I was lucky. And I’m a pretty good faller.
Crutches are really hard.
I ended up getting a peg leg walking crutch thingy. It was a bit better on stairs. Hope you’re healing well.</p>

<div class="md"><p>I have a bad back due to being the victim of a drunk driver when I was a kid. Bad accident that screwed my spine up. I went through physical therapy and was able to strengthen up my body to mitigate some of the problems but my back still periodically goes out completely. I was in my mid 20s when it went out on me and I was living on my own. I was trying to tough it out and just stay home for a couple of days. I went into my tiny kitchen at the time, slowly shuffling along. For whatever reason a hard sneeze came on and what followed was a series of unfortunate events. I sneezed and went forward. Bc of how tiny my kitchen was in order to avoid bashing my head I had to curl in and go even lower than I normally would. Unfortunately I miscalculated and bashed my forehead into the counter. That coupled with the pain it caused in my back crippled me and I came to on my back on the floor. I was caught between laughing, crying, and accepting that this is how I&#39;d die. When the spasms and the laughter died down I got enough strength to push myself to the phone to call my parents (Lucky me had wood floors). God bless my mom who only laughed at me for a few minutes before helping into bed and getting me to the Dr the next day. Any delusions of youth and grandeur were extinguished that day.</p>

<div class="md"><p>I have gout cuz I&#39;m overweight. Drinking lemon water helps reduce uric acid levels in your blood. So I&#39;ve replaced drinking normal water, pop and juices with lemon water. I read a study about it in an Indian medical journal article. Noticeable improvements. There&#39;s also supplements that help reduce uric acid. I take a blend called goutrin. I&#39;ve also tried cherry juice. I also take a really hot bath at night every night. This helps circulate the blood in my feet better, which reduces uric acid from pooling in my feet. I swear by these things. My gout attack frequencies have gone down significantly. Oh and it&#39;s a good idea to get some colchicine and naproxen from a doctor. Have these in your cupboard when you feel an attack starting. This stuff will prevent a gout attack from happening.  I stabbed my hand with a chef knife once. Needed 3 stitches. Gout hurt worse than that.</p>

<div class="md"><p>It can take a long time for the issues to show up. Of possible try to drink it with a meal instead of sipping on it all day. </p>

<p>From my understanding there really isn&#39;t much diet wise that can alter your body&#39;s pH level. The body operates in a pretty narrow range. Outside of that range our enzymes reshape and don&#39;t work right, gas exchange doesn&#39;t work correctly, and other issues. Long term pH alterations are pretty much incompatible with life. Lots of claims are made about making the body more basic, but the science doesn&#39;t add up to me. I&#39;m always open to looking at competent research though.</p>

<div class="md"><p>Kidney stones and severe hemorrhoids are the two most painful things I&#39;ve been through, and I honestly don&#39;t know which was worse.  The stones took me to the ER two separate times but the roids have me asking for oxy after just a few days and they take a lot longer to heal.  And yes, the GI doc and I have spoken, as well as the colo-rectal doctor, and basically it&#39;s extra fiber, sitz baths, and an ointment and wait it out.</p>

<p>And I&#39;ve been through over 30 bone marrow biopsies, a bone marrow transplant and about 6 years of chemo.  Wouldn&#39;t wish roids or stones on anyone.  And I&#39;ve had gout pain too but only briefly because of chemo meds, so I don&#39;t feel confident in that memory.  Shards of glass does sound right from what I recall.</p>

<div class="md"><p>I was 2 beers away from a gout attack for 10 years,  before I was placed on the pill. I would get gout eating carbs three meals a day.  Even oatmeal for breakfast was bad.</p>

<p>Foods and supplements that don&#39;t have a lot of sugar, which are alkaline help reduce the amount of  gout attacks </p>

<p>But what cured me from gout, after 22 years was taking one teaspoon of fish oil and chaga tincture for over 6 months.  My blood circulation must be much better now, because my feet aren&#39;t cold anymore when I sleep, for the first time in my life.  My knee pain went away as well, I guess the doctor was wrong about needed another knee operation in the future.</p>

<div class="md"><p>Might need to go see a chiropractor or something. I know they get a lot of shit and admittedly they might be a little overrated. However when I was 17 I messed up my lower back pretty bad on a failed deadlift at the gym. Could barely even walk and I shrunk 2 inches. I went to the chiropractor and it honestly helped so much. Even if I would have healed on my own, every session made it so much more bearable for the next few days.</p>

<div class="md"><p>buddy let me tell you, you can say all you want about weight lifting, but if you&#39;re deadlifting 315 you got legs, back and grip strenght to fucking manage a 5 pound cake like a sheet of paper.</p>

<p>Also, training for cosmetics still means that you got the muscle strenght to do all the movements that it requires to gain muscle volume. Will it translate 1-1 to real life stuff? perhaps not, mostly because of muscle stamina (generally), but its not like you can curl 45x10 but can&#39;t lift a 30 pound bag of potatos</p>

<div class="md"><p>I mean I agree in principle but 315 isn’t that strong</p>

<p>Not to flex because I’m not all that strong either, but as someone who can probably deadlift 4 reps at 315 you still have to be careful putting a 5-pound cake into a freezer if you’re standing weirdly.

<div class="md"><p>I’m 29 years old. During the pandemic, I pulled a muscle on the outside of my hip and had to spend over $1,000 and 2-3 months in physical therapy to fix it. While I can’t say for sure, I’m like 90% positive I somehow pulled this muscle while masturbating. </p>

<p>Guess I should start stretching beforehand?</p>

<div class="md"><p>I’m not a doctor, but I was diagnosed with piriformis syndrome and it sounds an awful lot like what you’re describing. My doctor explained it likely won’t go away without physical therapy, and it’s likely to take a couple months. Either way you should get that looked at if you can.</p>

<div class="md"><p>In my 30&#39;s, this happened recently. Went to a wedding as a groomsmen. The photographer asked me and another friend to kneel down in front of the groom so every groomsmen can fit in the picture. I leaned in and had to explain that my knees would hurt too much if i did that. She asked the other guy, he had torn his ACL a few years back and couldnt. Asked others in the party, no can do, their knees were also poopy.....She then asked all the groomsmen to just stand behind my friend and she&#39;ll just make it work with all of us standing behind him.....</p>
