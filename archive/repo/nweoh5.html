<div class="md"><p>Wait till 40. I got into the best shape of my life at about 35. Then I got injured and went right back to my old ways. Now I’m 40 and while I can build muscle seemingly the same, the weight just doesn’t drop like it used to. It’s crazy!</p>

<div class="md"><p>It is harder, but once you get into the groove it&#39;s easy to keep things in control.  Low carb and whole foods, and only eat what U need, that&#39;s been my key to keeping lean at 50.  Oh, and a good dose of cycling with weight work between that.</p>

<div class="md"><p>I initially read crying at the end and was like at least I’m already doing part of this. </p>

<p>I have also been cycling though. Switched to that after a hip injury. Thanks for the tips! I was thinking earlier tonight I could focus more on carb restriction than I have been.</p>

<div class="md"><p>Yeah, I have found dropping carbs to play a huge part, you can control calories so much easier and you actually end up eating less as you tend to feel fuller for longer with the protein side of things.  Watch sugar especially, crazy how much is in a lot of food and drinks.</p>

<div class="md"><p>Personally I eat a lot of leafy green salads, and will add legumes (beans and chickpeas) into my diet for fibre.  For me it&#39;s just a matter of picking highest protein/nutritional density options.  I&#39;ll also have oats/cereal in morning, largely because I often don&#39;t like anything too heavy first thing.</p>

<div class="md"><p>I&#39;ve gotten a lot of shade on this sub for suggesting low carb but it really does help. Heavy carb consumption tends to lead to metabolic dysfunction. Years of that makes it hard to lose weight. It&#39;s not the age, it&#39;s the years of abusing your metabolism.</p>

<div class="md"><p>Agree.  Reliance on carbs just sets your system up to basically rely on short term sugars, and it&#39;s a very unstable system, not great for metabolic health.  Low carb has been instrumental for my health in my 40s and now into my 50s, and really help keep things in check</p>

<div class="md"><p>What does your diet look like? Alot of the time this has alot to do with keeping your carb intake the same and protein intakes the same as you age. But, As you age you need more protein and less carbohydrates. You can view it like carbs provide you with antioxidants, fiber, and replenishment. But higher protein diets will definitely help keep things under control. </p>

<p>Alot of it is a hormone game. What are you eating, how are you sleeping, etc.</p>

<div class="md"><p>I’ve been thinking my diet was pretty okay but tonight after feeling sorry for myself it hit me I could probably restrict carbs a lot better than I have been. </p>

<p>Also sleep habits could be improved. </p>

<p>Lately I’ve been working out a lot but it’s been strength training focused. Going to try to focus back on cardio with strength training twice a week because not seeing this number drop is getting more discouraging.</p>

<div class="md"><p>A good rule of thumb I use for carbs is avoid all bread and processed carbs. That includes beer. First thing in the morning- protein. Save the carbs for after a workout. I know this sounds counter intuitive for performance - but if the goal is weight loss thst will work. You&#39;ll probably also get stronger.</p>

<p>Fasting also helps, but just be careful with it. Periodic fasting can be extremely beneficial for fat loss, but also even strength gain because it helps foster anabolic hormone release. </p>

<p>Honestly you&#39;d probably get a lot of positive results if you just ate meat in the morning without carbs. Just protein, fat - maybe some vegetables for the fiber, but very low glycemic carbs.</p>

<div class="md"><p>Try to track your calories for a week or so (if u are not doing it right now) to get an idea of how much you get everyday. Sometimes, small things like oils, salad dressing etc add up in calories too quickly without you realizing. If u frequently eat out, it may be difficult too, for it ll be hard to know how much calories you consume each day.</p>

<p>Once you know the average for a week, you ll get better control over what to eat more or less. Try a small calorie deficit and see if the weight goes down (if yes, continue the same or reduce a little more). Look for foods that satisfy your appetite but are not high in calories.</p>

<div class="md"><p>From what I experienced it&#39;s not because we are getting older. It&#39;s because as you age you are usually more busy and have more to do. My mother for example always tells me she works a ton and after work she is just not willed or too tired to put any efford in doing a workout for example. Try to see it as a state of mind. Try to say to yourself that you are badass and can do this. Don&#39;t think about it too much. Just try to exercise every they a bit and be consistent.                  Hope it helps a bit and u get me right. Wish you the best :)</p>

<div class="md"><p>Like I will go against the grain here and say its all about finding balance not so much about age. Yeah its true that as we get older, physiologically our metabolism does go down and that&#39;s why exercise is important to counter that to prevent loss of muscle. As we get older we definitely should be exercising more so that our metabolism doesn&#39;t go down. The balance is doing the right exercises and eating in moderation. Although I would agree with the other commenter, low carb does work better as you get older. I eat more protein nowadays. </p>

<p>On top of that cutting down alcohol also helps a lot and help keep the calories in check. Also hangovers get a lot worse as we get older. </p>

<p>I&#39;m saying this because I was the opposite and have been overweight since my teens till I was about 28. Was actually in the best shape of my life when I was 30-31. Currently I&#39;m 34 and I think I&#39;m still doing alright. Not to mention I&#39;m also petite(4ft11) so weight does show up quite easily on my frame.</p>
