Stop Qualifying Your Results

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>These are all common types of questions/statements I see here and on other subs from beginners:</p>

<p>&#39;Is this a good lift for a 6&#39;/145lb/17yo lifter with mild scoliosis and a peanut allergy?&#39;</p>

<p>&#39;My lift is not very high but I also weigh very little so it&#39;s good for my weight&#39; </p>

<p>&#39;Is this a good lift for a beginner who has been lifting for 178 days and 14 hours?&#39;</p>

<p>&#39;I lost 30lbs but my lifts only went down 20lbs so actually I am stronger&#39; </p>

<p>&#39;I&#39;m the strongest lifter that&#39;s 45 years old at the YMCA I go to on the weekends&#39;</p>

<p>You get the idea. </p>

<p>People are very fixated on qualifying their accomplishments. Instead of just getting stronger, they want to change the context of their results to make them appear better. Links to sites like symmetricstrength are presented all the time by and in response to beginners talking about &quot;How good is X lift of mine&quot;. People ask for levels that are good for someone who has only been lifting a year, or who is 140lbs or whatever. </p>

<p>This doesn&#39;t make you strong. Dressing up your 250lb deadlift in any number of &quot;Well it&#39;s strong for a _______&quot; does not change the fact that you have a 250lb deadlift. And yes, there is probably a subset of very small, very old, or disabled people for which a 250lb deadlift IS strong. But they know that already, they aren&#39;t asking. Strong people are not looking to qualify or validate their accomplishments. They know how much work they put in to get there and know that they are strong. Everyone else needs to stop trying to find reasons for why what they are currently doing is good and actually work to reach their potential. If you do that you don&#39;t need to say &quot;I&#39;m strong <em>if you consider X Y and Z</em>&quot;, you can just say &quot;I am strong&quot;.</p>

<p>Anyways, the whole reason I made this post was to share <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UvGTlUt7Y3k&amp;ab_channel=AlexanderBromley">this video by Alex Bromley</a> that was linked on <a href="/r/weightroom">/r/weightroom</a> earlier today. I think the average user here will get more value out of this than the average user there. I didn&#39;t want to dump a link without any context. </p>

<p>And this is probably not worth saying as the kind of people likely to be guilty of this won&#39;t read this far anyways but please <em>actually watch the video</em> before commenting for or against any ideas <em>you think</em> might be presented within in. Also if you want to address a specific point please try to include a general timestamp so anyone interested can find the exact context without searching through a 20 minute video.</p>
