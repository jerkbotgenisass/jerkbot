<div class="md"><p>Wow what an absolutely terrible thread. I was actually with him for the first half. I thought it was going to lead into a relatively boring but uplifting &#39;don&#39;t compare yourself to others, compare yourself now to yourself yesterday&#39; but then he veered off hard into &#39;Don&#39;t feel good about yourself unless you are a powerlifter&#39;.</p>

<p>How is it a problem if people are happy they can deadlift 250lbs? How is it an issue if people like to call themselves &#39;strong&#39; because they are <em>literally physically stronger than average</em>? I guess &#39;strong&#39; should be implicitly comparative only to other lifters, not to anyone else. While we&#39;re at it, let&#39;s make &#39;smart&#39; mean &#39;smart compared to people with graduate degrees&#39;, &#39;wise&#39; mean &#39;wise compared to religious scholars&#39;, and &#39;funny&#39; mean &#39;roughly as funny as a professional comedian&#39;.</p>

<p>As cliche as it is, the only worthwhile advice for training. You don&#39;t know anyone else&#39;s story, so why compare yourself to them.</p>

<div class="md"><p>Definitely agree. I&#39;d say it&#39;s very valuable advice in nearly everything! But of course it&#39;s often easier said than done.</p>

<div class="md"><p>I enjoy staying fit and love to get exercise but holy fuck I’m never going to join a fitness community, they’re almost always fuckin white supremacist testosterone overload cesspits. </p>

<p>Like I don’t wanna sound whiny and over sensitive, but man lots of fitness communities are toxic masculinity incarnate.</p>

<div class="md"><p>The real problem with trying to compare yourself to other people is that people hype themselves up far too much. You could go onto that website people use for &#39;benchmarking their benches&#39;, ask the top 5 people to record themselves actually doing what they claim to do, and you can damn well bet they can&#39;t even get close to that.</p>

<div class="md"><p>God this post and the threads are so fucking dumb. How are you not qualifying your results if you are only allowed to compare yourself to the strongest lifters?</p>

<p>An actual unqualified result would be compared to the general population, in which case you are likely strong if you do strength training. It’s that simple.</p>

<div class="md"><blockquote>
<p>People are very fixated on qualifying their accomplishments. Instead of just getting stronger, they want to change the context of their results to make them appear better.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This is so fucking dumb lol, most people don&#39;t simply want to be as strong as possible, they just want to be fit, as the name of the damn subreddit implies.<br/>
The amount of weight that you should be capable of lifting in order to be reasonably fit absolutely does change depending on your bodytype, so why not qualify it?  </p>

<p>But I guess a fitness subreddit thinking about and actually understanding what the word &quot;fit&quot; means is too much to ask, bunch of dumb meatheads.  </p>

<blockquote>
<p>And this is probably not worth saying as the kind of people likely to be guilty of this won&#39;t read this far anyways but please actually watch the video before commenting for or against any ideas you think might be presented within in. Also if you want to address a specific point please try to include a general timestamp so anyone interested can find the exact context without searching through a 20 minute video. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Also, LOL at demanding that people watch an entire 20 minute video before daring to criticize him.</p>
