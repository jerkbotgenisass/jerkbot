<div class="md"><p>Is your regular gym the fucking Olympics? I&#39;ve worked in multiple gyms for 4 years so yea I do know how fast they get destroyed if you throw them around like this. Because you also ruin the bar and the floor when dropping bars like that.</p>

<div class="md"><p>Yes, because all people who train Olympic weightlifting go to the Olympics. Where do you think most weightlifters train? Regular ass gyms or crossfit boxes, maybe a couple weightlifting gyms. Even in the most elite weightlifting gyms they still use normal ass bumper plates. Of course, if you throw around cast irons like bumper plates they’re going to break eventually, but the plates in the video are very obviously meant to be thrown.</p>

<p>The four years working in gyms is really impressive though. It’s amazing how long you’ve spent in a gym and still learned so little.</p>
