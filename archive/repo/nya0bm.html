<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I want an honest opinion. I am terrified of losing my hair, getting acne - anything that makes me less attractive basically is my only worry.
You think it‚Äôs worth it to go on another cycle? And if so what would you suggest, should I do a harder cycle than my first or start at the beginning with something low dose? Thanks in advance bros</p>

<div class="md"><p>The acne I got was mostly just on my back and honestly wasn‚Äôt that bad. Use acne treatment stuff daily and it won‚Äôt be that hard to manage. Hair loss is only really an issue with DHT derivatives, and it‚Äôs not so much hair loss as it was increased shedding. If you run another cycle, just change 1 thing so you know how your body responds. So like, if you increase your test then everything else stays the same. If you add a new compound, don‚Äôt change your test ester or your test dose.</p>

<div class="md"><p>Well I had no side effects regarding ‚Äúmy attractiveness‚Äù sorry not sure of a fancy word not an English main. And I already struggled with almost all physical aspects so I had regular scheduled blood work and pretty much had no additional harm done. I used during summer (last year) to gain that extra bit of non natural look and obviously haven‚Äôt been able to recreate that since then. I wanna use it cause I feel without peds I won‚Äôt be able to get back to that level, but at the same time my face is how I make money and therefore it‚Äôs a big risk. The health aspects are less of a problem, due to those check ups I need to have anyways</p>

<div class="md"><p>The thing with steroids is this, do you want to be on them permanently or not? Because to look like you do on roids is obviously temporary so you either keep blasting, or keep cycling on and off, which will dramatically effect your hormones and could lead to issues down the road. Not death, but issues... or you could just build your physique naturally and not risk any of it. It&#39;s fake gains, you&#39;re just borrowing them and have to give it back with interest. </p>

<p>Stay natty and have an easy life mate, that&#39;s my advice.
Why complicate your life with hormonal changes and having to score decent roids etc, life&#39;s complex enough as it is.</p>

<div class="md"><p>No you can&#39;t!!!! ü§£ü§£ü§£ü§£? ..  literally nobody would do more than 3 cycles if you &quot;kept your gains&quot;</p>

<p>You must have been dropped on your head as a baby if you think the body can mimic the dynamics of having T levels at 1000s of percent above normal. Your claims are unfounded, idiotic and demonstrably incorrect. 
You keep gains if you cycle and maintain, not if you stop altogether and the half life runs fully. 
It&#39;s like claiming you&#39;re still drunk 2 weeks after actually being drunk, you have no idea how drugs work.</p>

<p>Please, PLEASE do not cite studies that showed rats had trace increase levels of muscle nuclei after steroid use or some shit because that nonsense if you actually look at the study and extrapolate that you therefore keep your gains as a human being.</p>

<div class="md"><p>lol I‚Äôm
Not reading all that because I said, u can keep gains u wouldn‚Äôt have gotten if u would of stayed natty, of course your not gonna keep the cosmetic look of steroids when ur off no shit. But if u do pct right u can keep some muscle, from someone who‚Äôs been on and off steroids I can tell u for a fact u still keep some muscle after u get off. If your doubting me than u prob don‚Äôt know how to pct and or when u got off u were a lazy piece of shit and didn‚Äôt keep up with your routineü§∑üèΩ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è</p>

<p>No, I said that YOU should not quote bs studies about how rats on roids retained a minute amount of new nuclei after hormone use and then extrapolate it to human beings.. can you even read? I&#39;m starting to think you&#39;re an idiot</p>

<div class="md"><p>Never quoted anything,  all I said is if someone hops off and say gained 30lbs from the steroids they took they would still keep a couple pounds of it. Yea they might lose 25lbs but guess what they still kept 5lbs, as long as your still working out and doing everything right like HCG AFTER CYCLE  u still can keep a %. I don‚Äôt get why your not agreeing with me literally anyone who‚Äôs used can tell u that.</p>
