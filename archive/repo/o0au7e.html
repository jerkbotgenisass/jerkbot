<p>When I lay on my side in bed to sleep, I find it impossible to sleep with my knees bought up to near my  chest in a 90/90 position (on side). Instead my legs completely straighten out the whole time. </p>

<p>I do a lot of core exercises and feel my abs are strong, what could be stopping me from maintaining this position?</p>

<p>I also struggle to sit upright in a chair for a long period of time!</p>
