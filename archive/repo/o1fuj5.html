New Rule: No Natty Policing

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>As of late there&#39;s been a <em>massive</em> uptick of people accusing posters of using gear based solely on pictures and their own poor results. </p>

<p>This will no longer be tolerated. From this moment on any accusations will result in a permanent ban with no appeals, if you want to accuse people of using gear take it over to <a href="/r/NattyOrJuice">/r/NattyOrJuice</a>. </p>

<p>This rule takes effect immediately and is not up for discussion.</p>

<p>Cheers!</p>
