Im starving myself but I’m not losing weight. I’m also getting stronger

<div class="post">
<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>23m, 6’1” 167-170lbs. Been lifting since 2015 but would likely gain at most 5lbs of muscle per year. Maintainence calories at 2600 but currently at 2100 8 weeks into cutting. Feels like im starving. </p>

<p>Workout wise I focus on compounds with bodybuilding accessories after.</p>

<p>Not sure whats going on but I can’t cut like I used to. My bodyfat went down slightly but plateaued, as my strength for certain exercises improved while others slightly diminished (5% decrease).</p>

<p>Only supplements I’m taking is preworkout: evolution nutrition shred and cellucor no3. Nothing else. </p>

<p>If this is what a recomp is like then I think its my first time experiencing it. I just was expecting more fat loss because I find it hard to believe im putting on muscle this quick. But I’m curious if theres something going on that I’m not noticing.</p>

<p>Heres my diet:</p>

<p>Macros:
160g protein
200g carb
70 fat</p>

<p>Cheat days once every 10 days, with only 200 cal + current macros.</p>

<p>diet: mostly chicken, rice, fruit, and occasionally one processed food per day.</p>

<div class="md"><p>Are you weighing everything? Are you using a spreadsheet and daily weigh ins? You may feel like you’re starving but you are simply not in a deficit if you’re not losing weight.</p>

<p>I recommend using the 2suns TDEE spreadsheet and lowering your calories.</p>

<p>Also, that’s very light for 6’1. Might need to bulk up, rinse and repeat.</p>

<div class="md"><p>Yes weighing everything. Since my cut in April, I&#39;ve lost about 6 pounds. I definitely see some fat loss, but a big plateau is whats going on right now for certain.</p>

<div class="md"><p>I’m in same boat, lost 6 pounds since April 18th, 6ft and 170 lbs. </p>

<p>Yesterday I reduced my cals from 2000 to 1800 and started losing weight again, after a 3 week plateau. </p>

<p>Unfortunately it takes being hungry and uncomfortable to get to the 10-12% range. </p>

<p>What’s your current bf?</p>

<div class="md"><p>Yeah man I&#39;m also a fat bastard in soul so I&#39;m right there with you. Also in the same BF range.</p>

<p>Black coffee, shortening my eating window and a shit ton of water help with that.</p>

<p>I&#39;ve also done a lot of cuts so I&#39;m used to feeling hungry and try to embrace it. If you&#39;re hungry, it usually means you&#39;re on the right track.</p>

<div class="md"><p>The makro split looks good so far. I&#39;d go higher with protein for better satiation but thats personal preference. But what are the foods you eat? What does a full day of eating look like? I&#39;m asking because it seems pretty strange to me that you have problems with 2100Kcal. I&#39;m 5&#39;11&#39;&#39;, 190lbs (approx 13% BF), 6x/week weightlifting, 10.000 steps each day, 2 times boxing and some cardio sprinkled in. I feel pretty fine with 2100Kcal while cutting. I eat a lot of filling foods to keep my cravings under controll though</p>

<div class="md"><p>It’s not <em>impossible</em> to get stronger when cutting. </p>

<p>People attribute loss in strength when cuts drops below or around the 10% bf region. Once’s cuts reach this point the real lethargy and hormonally suppressive effects of having low body fat set in. </p>

<p>My guess : You’ve cut and plateaued at a body fat level whereby your body isn’t losing anymore fat but is still at a level to continue to support muscle growth.</p>

<div class="md"><p>Ok looks good so far. Are you weighing the chicken cooked or raw? Im thinking maybe your tracking entries are not exactly what you are eating. Also could be that your cut is to aggressive to start and your body is going to assume its once regulated amount of calories is now less available which will trigger it to store fat or down regulate metabolism. You are fighting nature here with cutting never before in human history did we have to lose weight so manipulating that system is tedious. </p>

<p>2 things i would ask yourself. Is your maintenance really accurate? Can i gain more muscle?</p>

<p>I say this because at 6’1 if you had a decent amount of muscle you could be  200 lbs and 12% bf and look great. If you feel like you are starving chances are you are. I would reconsider the cut you have some gainz to make my friend. I think maybe you are getting obsessed with the number on the scale when you could be obsessing over muscle gain</p>

<div class="md"><p>My maintenance is accurate, talked to multiple professionals about it as well as testing fluctuations myself. And can I gain more muscle? ABSOLUTELY. I feel like I&#39;ve looked the almost same since I started working out. I look like a built soccer player, but with maybe a bit more muscle in the upper body. </p>

<p>Despite my experience, my body still says that im intermediate at most. I feel like with the effort I put in, I should at least be 185 by now comfortably.</p>

<div class="md"><p>I&#39;m cutting because I just lost confidence and wanted to look good while the weather is warm. </p>

<p>Certainly did a dedicated bulk before, then I caught covid, then I only had 3 months to get back on track. This 3 months was right before I started cutting but in hindsight thats when I probably put on the most muscle the quickest.</p>
