Question: Afraid of Sleep Apnea if i get strong
<br/><strong>Posted by <a id="userlink" href="https://www.reddit.com/user/super_manly/">super_manly</a>. </strong><em>Posted at 7:3 UTC on June 18, 2021. 1 Points. </em><em>(self.<a id="selfLink" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/bodyweightfitness/">bodyweightfitness</a>)</em><em> (<a id="postpermalink" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/bodyweightfitness/comments/o2j1jr/question_afraid_of_sleep_apnea_if_i_get_strong/">Permalink</a>)</em>
<div class="post">
<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>My parents have sleep apnea and I snore according to my SO. Sometimes, I wake myself up because of trouble breathing.</p>

<p>I am 35 years old, 6 ft 200 pounds with about 30 to 35 percent body fat. I cant do a pull up / more than 3 pushups in good form to save my life.</p>

<p>I want to lose weight and be strong. But I feel like if i increase my strength, i gain neck muscles and it may worsen my snoring.</p>

<p>My goal is not looks. I just want to be able to have the strength do pull ups, pushups., and have normal levels of testosterone for my age. But I am afraid my neck grows and worsens my condition in the long run if i try any muscle building.</p>

<p>Should I just stick to cardio to lose weight as I am more susceptible to sleep apnea if i build muscle?</p>

<p>Please help. Thank you.</p>

<div class="md"><p>Correct me if I&#39;m wrong but isn&#39;t your current state favoring sleep apnea? If you started to work out you&#39;ll probably loose some bf on the way which afaik would be benefical. </p>

<p>I honestly don&#39;t really know though as I&#39;m not a doctor, which is probably the right adress for your concern anyway. I&#39;d ask a professional if I was you instead of random strangers on reddit tbh</p>

<p>That’s not how any of this works.</p>

<p>Sleep apnea is associated with obesity for a reason.</p>

<div class="md"><p>This is not something you need to worry about. The amount of neck muscle you need to induce sleep apnea is pretty ridiculous. As in, YEARS worth of heavy power lifting. I somewhat doubt that calisthenics would even be able get you there since bodyweight would probably not be enough stress to cause the body to build that much neck muscle. Working out, eating right, losing weight, and gaining some muscle will almost certainly reduce your chance of sleep apnea.</p>

<div class="md"><p>As someone who is familiar with sleep apnea I can tell you that weight is not always the reason someone develops it. I know this because I’ve spoken to a sleep therapist. It can develop based on genetics such as being born with a narrow airway. Losing weight (fat) and gaining muscle is not going to hurt you (personal opinion). More than 20% of the population has sleep apnea and have never been diagnosed with it. If you’re concerned I would speak to your sleep therapist as well as your primary physician for advice. Chances are you have it, they recommend a CPAP and you press. I hope this helps!</p>

<div class="md"><p>First of all, don&#39;t be ashamed of snoring. It&#39;s kind of a natural thing we all have.</p>

<p>And if you want to stay fit while not gain any muscle, I suggest you can give it a try at calisthenics. You can try all the basics like push-ups and pull-ups to lose fat fast. These basics won&#39;t make you bulk up but will help you to get strong and fit.</p>

<p>Lastly, if you want, I wrote a story on how I lost weight and got strong same time easily.</p>

<p>You can read it <a href="https://teenwriter088.medium.com/heres-how-i-lost-33-lbs-of-weight-ebef93508769">here</a>.</p>

<p>Also if you choose calisthenics, <a href="https://teenwriter088.medium.com/i-choose-calisthenics-to-stay-fit-heres-why-abfa46e8a7fd">here</a> is a story on why you should choose it, and <a href="https://teenwriter088.medium.com/5-tips-for-a-calisthenics-beginner-b16f3611f7f0">here</a> is one on how to get started. I hope it helps.</p>

<div class="md"><p>Losing fat and gaining some muscle is likely to <em>improve</em> the symptoms you currently have, not make them worse. The kind of development that causes/aggravates apnea issues for some strength athletes isn’t something you’ll achieve from calisthenics alone, at your age, natural. (I <em>dare</em> you to gain 20 pounds of muscle. Go ahead. Try.) You’re talking about 300+ pound strongmen, football players, etc. This seems like a naive concern.</p>
