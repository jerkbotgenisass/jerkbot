<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Im giving up on this. I think I started about a month ago, but now im stopping.   </p>

<p>I&#39;ve been trying to do the Minimalist routine. Today I did about 3x8 push ups on the kitchen counter  and when I tried to do find a lower inclination, I couldn&#39;t do any push ups. I dont really know what im doing right or wrong. I have no clue what im doing. Walking lunges are too easy, I dont have a way to do the Rows, so i have done Reverse push ups.. idk. </p>

<p>&#x200B;</p>

<p>Im just going to keep jogging and running from now on. Ive been doing that for a month now? Where i walk for 5 mins, jog for 1 min. Do it for 30 mins and then each week i get increase it by 1 min, so 4 min, then 2m. And so on. I dont know what to do when I reach the end of it, do i add resistance bands or something?</p>

<p>&#x200B;</p>

<p>Im giving up, im not any good for this.. I wished I could start martial arts but cant because of corona. I was hoping I could do some conditioning before that so im ready sooner.</p>

<div class="md"><p>I am not an expert but I think perfection kills motivation. Do what you can and what helps you moving forward. I normaly do regular push ups and then when there is no power left I continue with the knee ones. I am not crazy into theory tbh and just try to some body weight stuff to compliment my running. So take it with a grain of salt but i guess simple exercises are vetter then giving up :)</p>

<div class="md"><p>Keep running. Yes you&#39;ll maybe hit a plateu, but I ran first, then started working out. The weight I lost from eating less and running made it so much easier to work out. So imo you should maybe focus on running instead for a while. It takes time, and it&#39;s really hard. But I personally saw more progression running than working out. Which in turn gives more motivation.</p>

<div class="md"><p>Jesus man what the fuck is up with your pissed off responses? These are people legit trying to help your lazy ass. It’s not their fault that you lack the dedication. I mean this sub basically has a „how to work out“ in the sidebar, every question being asked daily is answered just there. </p>

<p>From what you’ve described it sounds like you&#39;re overweight and lack equipment, well instead of whining about it how about you go to a park and do your workout there?!</p>

<p>Changing our bodies from not fit to fit is not easy and doesn’t happen over night but you quitting and being pissed off by strangers doesn’t change a thing about it, you need to realise this. You’ll just stay fat and not being able to move.</p>

<div class="md"><p>Then I assume it&#39;s a combination of weakness and fat. The easiest IMO would be to focus on one of the problems, and I&#39;d chose fat. Get rid of it, not all of it but the extra. That will make it so much easier to work out, and since you&#39;re not very strong, being in a deficit and doing cardio won&#39;t hurt your strenght much at all. You&#39;ll even be able to do more since you don&#39;t weigh as much.</p>

If those who you live with (I&#39;m assuming parents), then they really don&#39;t care sbout your health and are somewhat bad parents.

<div class="md"><p>Pushups are very hard for people to start if they can&#39;t do any at all. That is certainly no reason to give up. If your serious about quitting then you would have just stopped, but you came here, and that shows me you have some sort of willpower left in you that wants this. Thats ALL you need. Pushups are arms and chest, so do exercises that will build arms and chest and work your way to 1 pushup, THEN you can focus on doing more.</p>

<p>Can you do pushups on your knees? Even if not, getting in that position and doing the best pushup attempt you can will help build muscle and form. Keep running like you said, but don&#39;t give up on what you really want just because its hard. you CAN do it, just not yet.</p>

<div class="md"><p>hips not really, core will depend on if you activate it while going down. If you rest all your weight on your knees and just balance with your hands while you go down you wont really get anything out of it. This is why its a good starting point, you can slowly put more of your weight forward, activate your core, and grow muscle as you get better.</p>

<p>If you can do a regular pushup, knee pushups aren&#39;t recommended but if you need a place to start it far better than nothing.</p>

If you give up you have failed, if you continue you eventually will without a doubt succeed don&#39;t focus on when you will just do it, I&#39;ll tell you why because behind every failure is another failure that leads to success. But behind every I quit there is nothing more. </p>

<p>Never quit, ever!</p>
