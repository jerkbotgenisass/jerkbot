<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>i&#39;m currently doing keto essentially just meats + vegetables, curious about trying full on carnivore, would it be possible to maintain ~10% bodyfat on this diet? would love to hear from any bodybuilders in this group who also do carnivore</p>

<div class="md"><p>I’m not a body builder per se,  but yeah, you could definitely maintain that I think.</p>

<p>I’ve found my gains to be much better without the plants. They interfere with digestion and the more plants you eat, the less meat you’re eating.</p>

<p>Meat is the king for muscle building.</p>

<div class="md"><p>Only difference between keto and carnivore is you ingest fewer toxins and antinutrients and generally get higher-quality nutrients.</p>

<p>The only way it would cause fat gain is if the harmful plants you were eating were keeping your weight down, but for a healthy person it shouldn&#39;t be the case.</p>

<div class="md"><p>Why wouldn&#39;t it? If you&#39;ve done your research on keto you should already know that you can only really gain body fat from eating carbs. And fiber offers no benefits, which seems to be the main difference between carnivore and your current diet. So all you&#39;d do is cut out the fiber by removing the vegetables. Any nutrients you need can be found in meat and organs. Eating some liver once a week or so is recommended but vegetables are not needed for anything otherwise.</p>

<p>You&#39;d basically just make more room in your stomach for more useful foods, namely meat. Which would also make getting lots of calories easier, which is always a big factor when trying to build muscle. Just stick to the fat to protein ratios that you should already have been using on keto as this really is the same diet, just without any plant foods.</p>

<div class="md"><p>There are quite a few folks over on Instagram who are, if not bodybuilders, very fit and have seemed to maintain well on carnivore. @laura_primal and @lil_bit_of_fit and @carnivoregym come to mind but I know there are others out there.</p>
