I have a lot of belly & back fat and I don’t know how to get rid of it.

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I’m 24f, 5’4 &amp; weigh 142. I’m rather skinny but I have so much back fat. I’m a 32b in bras and I have so much fat. How do I get “lean”? What is the process?
I work out and lift weights about 3-4 times a week. I also go to spin classes 2-3 times a week. My diet can use some help so maybe I could gain some more assistance there.</p>

<p>Any advice?</p>

<div class="md"><ol>
<li><p>Follow a decent hypertrophy or strength program to build/maintain muscle </p></li>
<li><p>Eat a minimum of 1g of protein per lb of bodyweight every day</p></li>
<li><p>Count your calories in your diet as it is now. I&#39;m assuming your weight is stable. Eat 500 calories less than that every day and count your calories each day to ensure you are hitting this calorie target. Watch the scale. Aim to lose 1 lb a week and adjust your calorie target up or down depending on your rate of weight loss. After you reach your goal level of leanness adjust your calories up to maintainance level. </p></li>
<li><p>Do not become underweight. If you cut to the point of being a few lbs from underweight it means you need to build more muscle and do a slow bulk from that point instead</p></li>
</ol>

<p>That&#39;s it. Process should take about half a year.</p>

<div class="md"><p>This is good advice,  Also buy a scale for your kitchen. Sounds a bit much I know but unless you can accurately eyeball 100g of rice or 15g of butter is worth doing until you can. Also I like to use a tape measure too as if you put on muscle and loose fat you might not loose a lot of lbs on the scale.</p>

<div class="md"><p>Those numbers and your description aren&#39;t really tracking for me. I&#39;m a little confused about how you could have a lot of muscle and a lot of fat at your size. What is your lifting program and how much weight are you lifting?</p>

<div class="md"><p>5’4” and 142 lbs is just a couple lbs away from being overweight, FYI, so it’s probably just an issue of excess fat overall.</p>
