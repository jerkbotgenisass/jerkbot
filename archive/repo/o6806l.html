<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>this is a little confusing (also ive been training for 1 and a half years so I feel this would make sense for begginers more who are around this mark in their lifting career) basically what I mean is when you training I hate it when people say they dont go anywhere near failure on their first set cause than what was the point of that set, you should go to failure but on your last set go balls to the wall, so if im benching 2 of the 3 sets on bench im still going to failure but im not going so hard it feels like my chest is going to explode, so id push the weight extremely hard till the last reps and on the last rep im pushinng the weight were its super difficult but im not zapping all the glycogen out of my muscles until the last set for each exercise, if anyone is super confused by what im saying point it out and ill specify</p>

<p>&#x200B;</p>

<p>also im a natural lifter so i keep my reps around 6-8 a lot and (8-10 for isolation movements) since naturals get bigger from heavier weight</p>

<div class="md"><p>The way you described your &quot;to failure&quot; sets, you aren&#39;t going to failure but rather an RPE 8/9 - which isn&#39;t failure. There is a lot of evidence of poor understanding/lack of knowledge in your post. I would recommend a few things: </p>

<ol>
<li>As a beginner, you should just be following programs listed in the wiki instead of trying to go against best practices. </li>
<li>Stop concerning yourself with the minutia when you&#39;re a beginner.</li>
<li>Avoid trying to educate others on things you know nothing about.</li>
<li>Learn how to format a Reddit post.</li>
</ol>

<p>Good luck!</p>

<div class="md"><ol>
<li>When it comes to programs I usually go off of Natural Gallant Bodybuilding (whos been lifting for i think 34 years now) and people like elliot hussle etc</li>
<li>Ive never really oversimplified its just this type of factor everything else like eating I just do what I can be consistent with I dont look at 50 articles on 1 thing.</li>
<li>Im just saying what I think is better for me, when tf did I say I thought I knew more than others and Im trying to educate, im saying what I think is better for me</li>
<li>Im not on reddit all day nor do i rarely even go on here (once a month unless if I posted something) so I really dont give a shit how my posts look.</li>

<div class="md"><p>Failure is always balls to the wall..... you’re just doing whatever everyone else is doing, leaving reps in the tank for the first couple of sets and going to actual failure on the last.</p>

<div class="md"><p>Can i not share my opinion this is the internet after all, Im trying to say on the first sets I hit the last rep and on the last set i create scenarios in my head where it seems like my body is in a situation so i can get more reps out so 1 or 2 more.</p>

<div class="md"><p>failure is balls to the wall tf?</p>

<p>if I&#39;m benching and hit 8 reps and I know I can&#39;t get 9 then I have hit failure at 8 reps. I can&#39;t just scream and go super saiyan and do 3 more reps &quot;balls to the wall&quot;</p>

<p>If I finished my earlier sets with a rep or two in the tank then thats not failure thats RPE 8/9</p>

<div class="md"><p>basically i mean it as i usually have a perception in my head where if its balls to the walls i create a scenario like im picking a car up ove rsomeone stuck under, so basically failure is jsut me hitting the last rep and balls to the walls is going beyond what i think my body is capable of so I usually have a little more adrenaline on the last set, i hope that makes sense</p>

<div class="md"><p>I think you should be consistent with your nutrition (enough proteins and fats, not too much carbs), consistent with your workouts (good intensity/form ratio) and in a certain time, you will achieve a decent physique.  </p>

<p>If you were born for competing and be a good bodybuilder, you will realize it in less than 2-3 years of doing the above mentioned.  </p>

<p>People overcomplicate stuff, because overcomplication is what sells.  </p>

<p>Getting in very good shape is super simple. But it&#39;s super hard.</p>
