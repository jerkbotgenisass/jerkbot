<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Take a step back from training once in a while. It might do you some good.</p>

<p>TLDR: After taking a 6 month hiatus from training, I&#39;ve realised how obsessed I became about training. It became the only thing in my life, and now, since taking a break I&#39;ve realised what&#39;s important and am now happier because of it.</p>

<p>Now, a bit about my training...</p>

<p>I&#39;ve been training bodyweight fitness on and off for a few years now. I was making acceptable progress over the last couple of years, dipping in and out of weightlifting and calisthenics, but started to lose the ability for &#39;newbie gains&#39; and hit a bit of a plateau due to calorie intake. So around June/July time last year (2020) during the lockdown, I decided to start training seriously.</p>

<p>I started a strict routine, upped my food intake to 5 meals a day and increased my protein intake. I was working out pretty much everyday for 5 months straight and gained about 5 kg (mostly lean mass). I was constantly progressing, aspiring to be stronger, bigger and a more skilled athlete. I went from a 5 second adv. tuck FL to a 3 second full FL, from +10 kg weighted pull up to a +20 kg weighted pull up and from 0 RTO ring dips to 6 RTO ring dips. It became, basically, my life.</p>

<p>Then just before Christmas I got ill. It was just a cold, but meant I couldn&#39;t train for a few days. Having been stuck in lockdown for 7 months, and being a new graduate with a bit of the graduate blues, my mental well-being hit rock bottom. I got into a bit of a depression, stopped eating, stopped working out and lost 4 kg in a month. It was a rough time.</p>

<p>In January 2021, I managed to finally find myself a job doing something I was interested in. It gave me a new lease of life and my depression slowly became a thing of the past. Unfortunately, due to the nature of the job, it was almost impossible to eat properly and continue my workout routine. I started getting down again because I knew I wasn&#39;t able to eat well and work out. BUT IT DIDN&#39;T MATTER! I felt good, I looked good (even though I&#39;d lost almost 5 kg of lean mass) and actually felt better than I did last year whilst sticking to my routine. Undoubtedly I looked better whilst working out, but never saw it because I was always wanting to be bigger and stronger.</p>

<p>Having not worked out for 6 months, I realised that I ignored what I had achieved and became blinded by what I wanted to achieve. In hindsight, this made me unappreciative of my progress and made me unhappy. I realised how easy it is to become obsessed with training and progress and prioritise it over everything else in your life. Just remember why you&#39;re doing it and make sure it isn&#39;t causing you to over look what&#39;s important. Now don&#39;t get me wrong, working out is important for both physical and mental well-being, but it is not the be all and end all, and it&#39;s important to realise that.</p>

<p>Focus on what you HAVE achieved, not what you are YET TO achieve.</p>

<p>I hope this helps even just one person reading this. Keep healthy people!</p>

<p>Cheers</p>

<div class="md"><p>One of the many reasons I have a deload week is to force myself to focus on life outside the gym and to pour energy in to other areas. Well said and congrats on getting out of a hole. </p>

<p>While you&#39;re here, are ring dips really that hard that 0-6 is big progress? No hate but I&#39;m going to incorporate them after a period of getting up to a 45-60 sec RTO hold and German hang, I want to switch them for PB dips. What&#39;s an impressive af standard for them?</p>

<div class="md"><p>Not OP but yes, they are tough! I went from 2 to about 6 in 6 months and that&#39;s without RTO.</p>

<p>There are a few things to know just beyond the raw numbers though. I do them much much deeper now and with a lot more control, I never trained PB dips before because of how they tear up my shoulders, and I&#39;m a bit heavier than the average calisthenics guy.</p>

<p>Great exercise though and I think they&#39;re good fun.</p>

<p>Louder for the people in the back! I wish I had learned this earlier. It&#39;s so on point. I have a similar story. I worked out like a maniac and gained up to <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/CN2ayUwjbc9/">187 pounds</a>. And gave myself a fun case of ulcerative colitis. </p>

<p>I wish I had learned the lesson you learned BEFORE I decided to overstress my body with overeating and overtraining. I&#39;m happy you learned it already! Great work and great post, OP!</p>

<div class="md"><p>I train hard for 4 weeks, and then take a week off. And every time I come back from that rest week in find I&#39;ve broken one plateau or another. I might add a pullup two rep, or lose 2 pounds, or take ten seconds off my 10k pace, I never know where I&#39;ll make progress, but I airways do!</p>

<div class="md"><p>Why do these kinds of posts always get such great feedback on this sub?</p>

<p>Like, yeah, don&#39;t develop a bad relationship with exercise. Don&#39;t be obsessive. </p>

<p>But like -- you needed a <em>six month</em> break from training to find balance after only a couple years of training? </p>

<p>I don&#39;t get it dude. </p>

<p>I don&#39;t think anyone else needs to take a six month break to make sure they have a balanced life. Do things with your friends, eat some junk food once in a while. It&#39;s not that hard. </p>

<p>And if you like training, and want to place a high priority on it, that&#39;s <em>fine</em>.</p>
