<div class="md"><p>You are fine, aside from the fact that you are about to nocebo yourself into an issue. </p>

<p>There has been no conclusive evidence that supports no fap. As long as your training, effort, and recovery are in check you will make gains. Fap away if thatâ€™s what you want to do.</p>

<div class="md"><p>Not at all. I cant think of anyway how that would affect muscle buidling. Stoping it will cause you thinking about it 24/7 but once you let it out you get that feeling. Ya get me right lol</p>

<div class="md"><p>What the other comment said + you get a slight boost of test by abstaining for i think 7 days which then falls to normal levels, with this said its a negligible amount.</p>

<p>People do nofap not get big at the gym but because they have an addiction/ trouble having a normal live without masturbation</p>
