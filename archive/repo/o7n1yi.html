<div class="md"><p>Presumably it’s the same as bouncing deadlifts and similar, you might get something out of it, but you’re using momentum to get you past the hard parts and cheating yourself of actual gains in the process, while drastically increasing the risk of injury. With deadlifting there are plenty of these clowns on the lower end of the spectrum, but you rarely see this from anyone pulling 5 plates and up.</p>

<div class="md"><p>I guess it&#39;s more accurate to refer to the percentage of ones 1RM. I&#39;ve seen plenty of experienced lifters bounce 3-4 plates, something I&#39;m guilty of myself, but only as part of a warmup set where this is still &lt; 60% effort or so. If you&#39;re using a deadlift suit and bar, it can also be a challenge to actually get all the way down to the ground with this weight, as it&#39;s generally not enough to put much of a bend in the bar and give you the extra distance needed to really deload. The deadlift bar I use at home for example, and which is pretty typical of ones I use in meets, only starts to give after about 5-6 plates.</p>

<p>My point was more that I&#39;ve never observed people who train this way generally on their working sets move any serious weight. If you&#39;re an advanced lifter working on your lockouts or so, touch-and-go may be perfectly fine - Benedikt Magnusson did this a lot when he&#39;d switch to doing heavy singles top-down while building up his lockouts before a meet, for example,  citing an increased ROM than rack pulls and shorter recovery times. </p>

<p>That being said, your observation is probably true for commercial gyms, where it&#39;s relatively unusual to see anyone pulling more than 4 plates. I have no idea what the average is in Crossfit circles, I know they do train deadlifts, but I have no idea to what extent this features in their competitions or what kind of numbers they&#39;re expected to put up.</p>

<div class="md"><p>CrossFit is a competition. It’s not about building strength as much as it’s about completing a movement as quickly as possible. So as a result, they compromise form and do some whacky shit. And that is fine if you are an elite athlete who already has a solid weightlifting base, but if you are a regular Joe jumping into it, you’re gonna have a bad time.</p>

<div class="md"><p>This is pretty much it in my lengthy experience - I was part of a CrossFit program for about 10 years maybe? At least 8.</p>

<p>CrossFit is half exercise regimen and half sport/competition. If you&#39;re doing it right, you train mostly in a safe lifting program focusing on great form. When you practice for competitions and do some of the more extreme movements, you should never attempt anything above your level. The whole point is to target something about 60% off your ability. </p>

<p>All that being said, the kipping pull up and the butterfly pullups are critical stepping stones to the muscle up on the olympic rings, which is one of the core movements in CrossFit. Strict pullups train the strength, kipping pullups train the body motion. Form is critical, and the dude in this video neglected a very important point of pullup form: hold onto the bar. That&#39;s a pretty important one even in strict pullups.</p>

<div class="md"><p>This is the take that I’ve always loved and agree with. I like the comparison to baseball too, in regards to competition hazards. </p>

<p>First and foremost, CrossFit is a sport. It’s entertaining and it’s fun to watch the best in the world compete against each other. Crossfit should NOT be seen as a means to improved health/fitness for the general public and should NOT be used as a way to prepare athletes for sports. Crossfit training is great at only one thing: <em>preparing you to compete in CrossFit.</em></p>

<p>There are many elements of functional training within CrossFit; however, the implementation is haphazard and, ironically, not at all conducive to building a proper functional base. For example, a hang clean is a great way to teach a younger or athletic individual triple extension and power transfer <em>in small doses</em>. Three sets of 5 with sub-max weight is all you need to practice efficient movement. CrossFit requires <em>much</em> greater repetitions where form inevitably breaks down and the movement is no longer centered around mechanics, but volume. For a mid-aged or older adult, I would never give them a bar for an Olympic lift but would instead focus on the same mechanics via a box jump. CrossFit again misses the mark here for the same reasons.</p>

<div class="md"><p>Yes, but not as much as a strict pull-up. However, you can do more of these so depending on which muscle group you are targeting maybe higher reps is worth more than lower (but more quality) reps, maybe these have some place in some super specific structured workout routine? However I would bet using bands or something that lets you still do the full range of motion of a strict pull-up but with less weight would be infinitely better ( and safer, and better for your gym equipment) than this mess.</p>

<div class="md"><p>Eh, not really. Kipping pull ups do build a lot of different muscles, but they don’t build as much bicep, as your using many other muscles to do a lot of the work. Typically, kipping pull ups are a lot, and I mean a lot easier. For example, I can do around 40 or 50 strict pull ups without dropping, but I can do probably around a few hundred kipping pull ups without dropping. Also, these are butterfly pull ups, which are a bit more intensive overall then kipping pull ups as they have much more extreme movement. I think they are harder on the biceps too than kipping pull ups. I still find strict pull ups harder though.</p>

<div class="md"><p>It definitely does work more muscles than pull ups, but for the most part it just works legs a bit, biceps, and a tiny bit of core and grip. It won’t build nearly as much muscles in nearly as many places as burpees.</p>

<div class="md"><p>Agreed.</p>

<p>Question is though what are you trying to achieve? Some people run, some lift weights, some flop around on bars and some of us sit and watch Netflix but we&#39;re not trying for the same things.</p>

<p>If the goal is to be able to get your body from extended arms to chin over the bar as much as possible and as fast as possible this seems like the way to do that. For most people that&#39;s stupid and increases risk of injury for no real gain. But there are a lot of things that increase risk of injury for no real gain so I&#39;ll let them do what they want.</p>

<p>Whatever will get people to move around more, I&#39;m going to support it. If that means doing a fish impression on a pull up bar, go for it. If that means ballet dancing while wearing a trash bag and watching old episodes of Rugrats, I&#39;m for that. The world has too many negative health outcomes from lack of exercise and poor diet for me to be complaining about how someone chooses to stay healthy.</p>

<div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t necessarily blame the individual in this case, it&#39;s entirely possible that he just doesn&#39;t know any better, and the fact that he&#39;s out and exercising at all is of course a positive thing. Where it starts to become more questionable is with organizations like Crossfit that are intentionally teaching people things that will get them injured if followed, while somehow managing to avoid getting sued and being held liable in the process. There&#39;s a difference between telling someone to run 5k and telling them to run 5k blindfolded into oncoming traffic. Both will produce results, but one should rightfully be questioning the wisdom of the latter.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t know the origin of this style of alleged pull-up, but the cynic in me would guess that it was created as a method by which people who struggle to complete an actual pull-up could be convinced that they&#39;re suddenly able to do pull-ups, while conning them into believing that your method of training is somehow the reason they&#39;re able to now accomplish this extraordinary feat, instead of momentum effectively doing everything. I could see that appealing to people who want to see immediate results and are happy to take shortcuts if it means they don&#39;t have to do any hard work with less frequent payoffs, which is presumably a far more lucrative market.</p>

<div class="md"><p>The places I&#39;ve been generally discourage people from doing these. If someone is going to attempt them they first need to be able to do multiple strict pullups and most of the places have had time limits in place like, &quot;you need to have been doing strict pull ups for 6 months&quot;.</p>

<p>It&#39;s about making sure the muscles are developed so you&#39;re not just slamming the joints and tendons but rather controlling the whole movement. Then it&#39;s about giving those tendons time to develop in a more controlled manner. From there it&#39;s introducing the person to the movement gradually and watching them to make sure they&#39;re doing it right.</p>

<p>Does everywhere do that? Probably not, but most people do care about the safety of others.</p>

<div class="md"><p>To be honest, I&#39;ve done these. If you can&#39;t do a pull-up you&#39;re not going to do a bunch of these. Same with kipping pull ups. Are they easier than strict? Yes. Do I prefer doing strict with added weight? Yes.</p>

<p>This adds grip and cardio to the things that might be taxed by the motion. He didn&#39;t fall because he decided to let go, his muscles were fatigued enough that he couldn&#39;t hold on.</p>

<div class="md"><p>Normally I&#39;d agree with this sentiment. Exercising is almost always better than not exercising, and it&#39;s silly when one group of people gets chuffed about another group of people &quot;cheating&quot; in the weight room. Cheating at what, exactly? It&#39;s not a competition, and there aren&#39;t any rules. Even if you&#39;re working towards something like a powerlifting meet, there&#39;s no reason you can&#39;t incorporate &quot;cheat&quot; movements in your training.</p>

<p>But the issue with using this much momentum in a pullup is that it puts extra strain on your joints and tendons, which can cause injury. I realize every sport has the potential for injury, and the benefits of physical activity make it a worthwhile risk, but I just can&#39;t see how people justify doing pullups this way when there are much better and safer ways of making the movement pattern easier (assisted pullups, lat pulldown, etc).</p>

<p>I guess this style of pullup has become part of crossfit competitions, but that still leaves the question: why did they pick this in particular? Why not enforce strict pullups, like the US Marine Corp does for their pullup test? Strict pullups are easily one of the best upper-body exercises you can do, so why pick a variation that both promotes injury and looks ridiculous?</p>

<div class="md"><p>So, CrossFit approaches things from the view of as much as possible in as little time as possible. Is that safe? Not if you take it literally but most people have the sense to stop for a moment when they need it.</p>

<p>It does put extra strain on them, won&#39;t argue that at all. In terms of injuries though I hear a lot more blown ACL and strained ankle issues from my friends that play pickup basketball than injuries from the friends that do CrossFit. I had a doctor once specifically argue that summer softball leagues were too dangerous because people with no other exercise year round suddenly try to go 100% without warming up.</p>

<p>I&#39;ll also give you that strict pull ups are great and safer. I prefer them for general fitness and do some weighted every day with timed controlled descents. But if I&#39;m asked to do 5 in the middle of a workout, I&#39;m going to go with butterfly pull ups if they&#39;re allowed.</p>

<p>Last thing I&#39;ll call out is that across 2 gyms with well over 100 people, I know of 4 that do these. Most people aren&#39;t. Heck, most use bands to assist because that&#39;s the level they&#39;re at.</p>

<div class="md"><p>I agree, and not. The moving around part, yes. </p>

<p>Proper form, and good information needs to be emphasized. The goal, as a fitness professional, and business owner is to not injure your clients. That&#39;s what should be achieved. Profit, over personal integrity, and quality information too often come first. </p>

<p>There are a lot of predatory fitness models out there, with bad information. A lot of people can get <em>seriously</em> injured as a result of bad information. They can waste months, or years damaging their body, paying into a sham. </p>

<p>A lot of injuries can be prevented, and that&#39;s why some folks are there. They trust a large organization, and lack their own knowledge. </p>

<p>People&#39;s health, and well being should come first. Taking a daily walk, and changing your eating habits is more beneficial than whatever the fuck it is that this person was doing in the video.</p>

<div class="md"><p>Really great analogy about the blindfold and I couldn&#39;t agree more. I also agree that eating is the first thing that I&#39;d have anyone change and going from nothing to walking is a great step forward (pardon the pun).</p>

<p>My counter is that the real world and incentives don&#39;t work that way for many people. Going to a place where there&#39;s a sense of community and basically peer pressure to eat better and be in better shape can be a big deal. If you&#39;re surrounded by positive influences you&#39;re more likely to change.</p>

<p>Second point is that the places I&#39;ve been care about health and safety. They check in ahead of time, they know where you&#39;re at in your fitness level and if progressing to the next movement makes sense. People see lots of fail videos from CrossFit because they&#39;re interesting. You don&#39;t see the class of 65 year olds doing controlled squats to a box, bent over rows with a light dumbbell instead of pull-ups and using bikes because running isn&#39;t good on their knees. The 99% of CrossFit is really boring. Me going in and working 5x5 back squats and then running 2 miles with pushups inbetween is the norm, not this.</p>

<p>There are limited people that even try for a butterfly pull up (that&#39;s the name of it) and they&#39;re the people that can do lots of strict pull ups. You&#39;re not wrong that there are predatory people out there but I&#39;ve found that CrossFit owners are distributed just like the rest of the world. Some care a lot, some just want money, and the majority are in the middle.</p>

<p>In summary, I really do agree with what you&#39;re saying but think that reality is very skewed from what you describe.</p>

<div class="md"><p>I’m on board with so much of what you said. We’re just clarifying details. I used to teach fitness classes, myself. It was a journey for me to get though…and, I passed through some questionable schools of thought before I found a positive community, with quality information. </p>

<p>I think on Cross Fit, I have friends in sports medicine. Cross Fit is responsible for many injuries. As well as my own experiences from my students who wound up in that organization, previously or, post working with them.</p>

<p>I don’t think they’re all bad. I’m sure there are some qualified folks, but the overall reputation is not one I would ever want to be associated with you personally. If I was going to train with someone that taught at one, I would definitely weigh their methods, and credentials. That’s important to me, but I’m in a different stage of my journey. My goal is not to shit talk cross fit. I was training with an RKC Kettle Bell instructor, and while some people in cross fit have that cert, he stood out because he refused to teach through that organization. He actually trained with people at the top of that organization. He ran his own gym, and had that sense of community. Structure, and safety to take you into your future goals were his foundation. Not how many poor form reps. That’s more of what I’m advocating. Those folks aren’t always easy to find, and you need some experience to recognize what might be dangerous. I think that’s the problem, in the beginning you can’t do that. Then, you’ve been doing it for a while, and you’ve created your own “truth” through your social group. It’s prevalent in many fields. I’ve never met any cross fit instructors, or people that trained there that had that good information. That’s my personal experience, and like you said maybe not everyone’s. I’m not trying to roll with absolutes. </p>

<p>Fitness, and health is a journey. We don’t always have the best companions on that journey.  Im not an expert, but I am fortunate to have found some to train with. It makes a difference. Their goal being good habits/ form to keep you healthy, and mobile. From what I’ve learned doing more reps poorly, while it might help your ego, when you say “I can do 50 pull ups,” doesn’t build those long term benefits. And, it kind of makes you look bad when you technically cant do more than a few pull ups, push ups, or whatever properly. Especially, if they cost you time, and money with a PT, later. </p>

<p>I’m all for fitness, and movement. I’ve been to a lot of gyms, and some of them exist solely for profit, and are not based around credible information. Cross Fit winds up cultivating a cult like following where some of its followers refuse to listen to professionals, based on  science and medicine. It’s a business first, for many. </p>

<p>My goal was always to help people meet their goals, and keep them from getting injured. Having patience with yourself, and  being honest is part of that. Patience, support and good knowledge to create good habits are a big part of fitness, and health. I just hate seeing people get hurt with preventable issues. It’s easy to target Cross Fit, because they make themselves an easy target. Just my $.02. Thanks for being civil, and the good conversation.</p>

<div class="md"><p>The exercises and movements themselves in CrossFit are mostly ok. The problem is that they keep pushing you to do more and more weight faster and faster with all these movements, putting a massive emphasis on speed over form, to the point it causes injury.</p>

<p>I did it for about a year and had to ice my shoulder almost every night and go to a chiropractor after. If you&#39;re going to do it, do it for the aerobic, HIIT portion of it, not the constant increase in weight &quot;so you can PR.&quot;</p>

<div class="md"><p>Going from a climbing gym to a crossfit gym with friends is such an interesting and drastic difference in training. The athletes have somewhat similar fitness goals which they achieve in such drastically different ways. I don’t have a personal problem with this style of pull-up but I wouldn’t use it as I’d likely rip my shoulders out. It’s a lot  like watching someone learn a muscle up for the first time. Do Kipling pull-ups use your scapula in the same way? I also imagine training for power with kipping is nearly fruitless. As a functional way to get up it seems to work well. There are prob lessons for other athletes in terms of how to use body momentum though. I really don’t get it but it looks cool. Lul.</p>

<div class="md"><p>I cringe so hard when I see these CrossFit people doing kipups like this. Why did it ever become a thing to do a bunch of poor form chinups or pullups and act like you&#39;re accomplishing something other than looking like an idiot?</p>

<div class="md"><p>If I had to guess, I&#39;d say because they got a bunch of other idiots together that could provide each other with positive reinforcement, convince themselves that they had accomplished something worthwhile, and that any naysayers are just jealous and/or don&#39;t understand what they&#39;re talking about. There&#39;s a reason you don&#39;t see crossfit methodologies applied in isolation, it almost always needs some kind of groupthink to reinforce. The silliness of the exercises notwithstanding, that&#39;s borderline culty.</p>

<div class="md"><p>Doing real chinups is hard.  Swinging your legs and using momentum to do these swings is easier.  You have a higher number, so it makes you feel like you&#39;re working harder and you keep paying crossfit money.</p>
