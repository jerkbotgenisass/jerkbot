<div class="md"><p>I got parosmia from COVID so all meat tastes like dog shit. I&#39;m currently getting 120+ grams of my daily protein from whey and casein shakes so that&#39;s pretty much the same thing right? It&#39;s really not that bad and not having to meal prep has been nice</p>

<div class="md"><p>Sounds like protein shakes to me and honestly after spending a year doing it this way and finally switching to prepared meals and getting to taste the variety of tasty flavors out there I won’t go back. </p>

<p>Now I just use them to supplement</p>

<div class="md"><p>Would ingesting food through a feeding tube cause satiety? Cuz i would totally go for it for convenience but I’d be worried about overconsuming calories too easily.</p>

<p>The act of chewing and swallowing and actually having something solid in your stomach contributes a great deal to feeling full.</p>
