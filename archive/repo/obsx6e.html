Why don't bodybuilders use extended fasts to cut?

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Hi all, </p>

<p>Currently doing the recommended routine to try and bulk up. I&#39;m trying to figure out why a natural bodybuilder wouldn&#39;t use an extended fast (I&#39;m talking 2-3 weeks) to cut instead of following your typical incremental caloric deficit for a longer period. From the research I have seen, HGH levels increase up to 12.5x after 7 days of water fasting which would be crucial in muscle retention. <a href="https://thefastingmethod.com/fasting-and-growth-hormone-physiology-part-3/">https://thefastingmethod.com/fasting-and-growth-hormone-physiology-part-3/</a>. You also lose about .6- .8 pounds of fat per day.</p>

<p>I recently did a 17 day water fast ( I made a post here regarding my results if you want to see: <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/fasting/comments/nrbrsk/17_day_water_fast_results_may_17_june_3rd/">https://www.reddit.com/r/fasting/comments/nrbrsk/17_day_water_fast_results_may_17_june_3rd/</a>) so I know I can do it. I&#39;m currently on a clean bulk until the end of July. My plan was to do another extended water fast for 3 weeks because I still have a substantial amount of fat to lose. </p>

<p>Basically my question is, knowing that HGH levels go through the roof past 7 days of fasting, why wouldn&#39;t this method be used by professionals to reduce the time it takes to cut? Is it just a willpower thing? New science that hasn&#39;t caught up? I must be missing something here...</p>

<p>&#x200B;</p>

<p>Thanks for the responses.</p>

<div class="md"><p>If they&#39;re natural they&#39;ll lose too much muscle if they cut too fast as they won&#39;t have the proper nutrients and macros to maintain it while losing so much weight. It&#39;s about maximising muscle kept whilst cutting</p>

<div class="md"><p>Yeah, got a source for that? Because there are studies out there that show muscle retention during fasts and I&#39;ve never seen them distinguish between varus body fat percentages. If you have that study, I&#39;d genuinely like to see it</p>

<div class="md"><p>Yeah it&#39;s been pretty well established over decades of research and competitors experience of getting to extremely low levels of bodyfat. </p>

<p>I don&#39;t know of any competitive bodybuilders using extended fasts in contest prep, they always keep protein high and calories low as they get leaner. </p>

<p><a href="https://jissn.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/1550-2783-11-20">https://jissn.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/1550-2783-11-20</a></p>

<blockquote>
<p>It must also be taken into consideration that the leaner the competitor becomes the greater the risk for LBM loss [14, 15]. As the availability of adipose tissue declines the likelihood of muscle loss increases, thus it may be best to pursue a more gradual approach to weight loss towards the end of the preparation diet compared to the beginning to avoid LBM loss.</p>

<div class="md"><p>That study isn&#39;t about fasting at all. And the one time it cites a study on fasting is misleading (because the vast majority of studies on dieting aren&#39;t about fasting, so he&#39;s just presenting the results of traditional caloric restriction as consensus):</p>

<blockquote>
<p>However, the majority of chronic experimental studies have failed to show that different meal frequencies have different influences on bodyweight or body composition</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Studies have shown that fasting retains lean body mass better than traditional caloric restriction. The two methods affect the body in very different ways.</p>

<p>Do you have a fasting study that shows you lose muscle at lower body fat percentages?</p>

<div class="md"><p>It doesn&#39;t matter what you or I think is reasonable for the body to do, biology is always full of surprises.</p>

<p>If you don&#39;t have a study that supports your opinion, then let&#39;s be clear that it&#39;s just your opinion.</p>

<p>The closest thing I can think of that supports you is that some pro-fasting doctors do not recommend fasting for very lean people, but I don&#39;t specifically know what studies have shown that leads them to that caveat.</p>

<p>You lose muscle at very low bodyfat regardless, although adequate protein intake (2.3-3.1g/kg LBM) has been shown to lessen the effect of muscle loss.</p>

<p>No, when you presented literature related to traditional caloric restriction, my response was that we were talking about fasting, which is something very different. I asked for fasting studies and you had none.</p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>Oh, you&#39;ve stopped using your brain? I guess you gave a half-assed attempt, but then you decided you couldn&#39;t tell the difference between starving in a forced labor prison camp during a genocide and someone voluntarily giving up one of their comforts for a self-controlled period of time.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>All you&#39;ve shown is that you lose muscle mass in traditional caloric restriction.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>although adequate protein intake (2.3-3.1g/kg LBM) has been shown to lessen the effect of muscle loss.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Resistance training has also been shown to spare muscle.</p>

<p>This is my final message to you. After your idiotic Holocaust comparison it&#39;s obvious that you&#39;re just talking shit and not actually interested in the information behind this. So glad you were able to stink up the place with your lack of knowledge.</p>

<div class="md"><p>And now you&#39;ve hurt my feelings.</p>

<p>For what it&#39;s worth I think fasting 1 or 2 days a week can be useful especially at higher bodyfat but in this context of bodybuilding I think it&#39;s pretty silly as does pretty much everybody else.</p>

<p>What about the fact that out of all the top tier athletes in the world who compete in big name bodybuilding competitions none of them fast to cut? </p>

<p>I mean this is a group of people who are looking for every edge they can in order to win. </p>

<p>If it was superior or even the same I’d expect more of them to do it. I mean these guys are the experts at cutting fat while maintaining muscle. I’d say they’ve picked the best methods they can.</p>

<div class="md"><p>The muscles need energy to be maintained cutting to severely while being on a low bodyfat makes the body desperate for calories which can take much out of fat since it&#39;s already on the starvation range so the next big thing is muscles which would be broken down to meet calorie needs</p>

<div class="md"><p>Competitive body buildes? all the fasting discussions I&#39;ve read, have said those with seriously low body fat(under 15? possibly lower) have some really bad times with longer fasting durations because they have very little body fat to use as energy. I would imagine the body will start using muscle due to how little fat there is to consume.</p>

<p>at a competing level, they might be in a situation where they need to inch out the last bit of muscle growth(or retention) over a few grams of fat loss. and if that&#39;s the case, extended fasting and strength training, in addition to how little fat they have will definitely give them a bad time.</p>

<div class="md"><p>I can only speak for me and I&#39;m not a bodybuilder, I&#39;m a competitive martial artist.</p>

<p>In my experience, only extended fasts are faster than traditional dieting.</p>

<p>I once did two months of every other day fasting and needed to do rolling 72s in order to see quick weight loss.</p>

<p>With traditional dieting, I can lose about 10lbs a month. I usually have to lose about twenty pounds to compete in the weight class I want because my walk around weight is much higher.</p>

<p>If I fast for a full day, I only lose about .5 lbs. So even if I do every other day fasting, I&#39;m only losing 7.5lbs a month.</p>

<p>I have the discipline to eat reduced portions for two months and I can muster the discipline to fast every other day for two months, but unless I throw in several desperate rolling 72s I just don&#39;t see the same fat loss on fasting that I do on traditional caloric restriction.</p>

<p>However, I like fasting more that traditional dieting, it just doesn&#39;t work for quick fat loss for me</p>
