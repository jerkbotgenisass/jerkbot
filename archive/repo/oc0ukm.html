<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Hi all, as an experienced keto guy looking to make the leap to full carnivore (still getting asthma flare ups, maybe its plant veggies), this may be a silly question but what drinks are allowed? Or is it just straight up water and meat? Also, does beef need to be the staple and then eat other meats / fish around that? Finally, am I allowed miso in between eating to keep going?</p>

<p>(ppl with GI issues usually can drink some forms of alcohol, wine, spirits, on carnivore, if that&#39;s their thing, without it affecting their digestion)</p>

<div class="md"><p>some people drink coffees or teas, if you are doing this for a specific ailment, you might want to not consume any plant waters, but if you are just doing it because you feel better or something, they should be fine</p>

<p>I do coffee before noon, and decaf coffee afternoon, with a splash of whipping cream</p>
