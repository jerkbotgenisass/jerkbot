Do you eat snacks?

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>The medication I take at 8pm makes me hungry an ~hour later, I dont know what to snack on when that happens, yesterday I had a can of salmon, 4 hotdogs and 80g cheese, hotdogs are easy for a snack, but they have lots of weird ingredients that I would like to cut out, same with similar things like pepperettes(maybe I can find some organic &#39;dogs that have better ingredients?)</p>

<p>what do you all snack on? </p>

<p>I could probably boil up some eggs, but I also do eggs for lunch so it dosnt seem that appetizing, plus I cant eat maybe more than 6 eggs at a time before I start to think they taste gross</p>

<div class="md"><p>I make burger patties and freeze so I can throw one or two in the air fryer as needed. Also eat pork rinds and make carnivore &#39;bread&#39;. Bread is a dozen eggs, handful of mozzarella, a pound of whatever ground meat you like, and a bag of crushed pork rinds. Mix and add to a loaf pan and bake at 350 for 15-18 min. When cool throw in the fridge. Take a slice of the bread with some butter anytime you want a snack. It doesn&#39;t taste like eggs, the rinds absorb them all and it is sort of corn bread texture.</p>

<div class="md"><p>Not sure where you are but you can get Tillamook no sugar added in every corner of the US and via Amazon. You can buy a food dehydrator and make your own, or use the oven (which I find very difficult but others swear by it). There&#39;s a million recipes online that contain no sugar.</p>

<p>Good luck!</p>

<div class="md"><p>I just checked amazon canada, Tillamook will ship from the states for $40 per bag lol, and all the canadian brands have 2 of the following 3, brown sugar and molasses and cane sugar</p>

<p>I always wanted to try pemmican, but that seems like it would be harder to make than jerky</p>

<div class="md"><p>I found one called McSweeney&#39;s ingredients were</p>

<p>BEEF, SEA SALT, DEHYDRATED GARLIC, DEHYDRATED ONION, ASCORBIC ACID (VITAMIN C), SODIUM NITRITE, SMOKE.</p>

<p>said 0g carbs per serving, plus there was a canadas  day discount and free shipping over $70, so seeing these dicounts my shopping addiction set in, I bought 3 boxes (5 x 70g per box) came to $72 with discount or $4.8 per 70g bag</p>

<p>its a little over my price range, so I dont think I will buy it again, plus I was kinda dissapointed there was no plain option and I had to get garlic and onion</p>

<div class="md"><p>Hi it‚Äôs very easy to make jerky! All you need is some meat, a baking sheet/pan, a rack or two that fits in the pan, and an oven. </p>

<p>On Amazon you can buy baking racks or jerky racks where they stack (make sure they are oven proof). Stack in the pan and then bake @ 170 F (or whatever it converts to in C) for 8+ hours. Jerky‚Äôs traditionally use lean meats but I prefer fattier ones like brisket.</p>

<div class="md"><p>Look for biltong, the South African version of jerky that&#39;s sugar free. It&#39;s virtually fat free, so add a little butter for satiety.</p>

<div class="md"><p>In general, I follow Mark Sisson&#39;s concept of WHEN, or eating When Hunger Ensues Naturally. So, snacks are super handy for this kind of thing. Generally, I keep some chicken thighs, boiled eggs, pork/salmon/chicken skin snacks, bacon, or steak cubes on hand for meat stuffs. </p>

<p>When dairy is okay, my favorite treat are Whisps. If you&#39;re staying strict, stick to flavors like Cheddar and Parmesan which don&#39;t contain garlic, onion, tomato, etc. If you aren&#39;t, flavors like BBQ, Nacho, and Ranch are available. Additionally, you can DIY this stuff and make homemade parm crisps or other &quot;baked cheese&quot; snacks.</p>

<p>As for hot dogs, 100% beef and uncured is your best bet. Poke around and see what you can find.</p>

<div class="md"><p>I keep a bag of cheese cubes in the fridge for moments like that. I&#39;ve also been buying some sugar free hard dry sausages at Costco. I keep a package in my car for hangry moments.</p>
