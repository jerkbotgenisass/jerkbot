Research on effective lengths of bulk vs cut cycles?

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Has anyone seen any research on how the length of bulk vs cut cycles impacts their effectiveness? The prevailing “wisdom” of the internet seems to be 2-3 months, but that seems like a long time to me. I’m also wondering how much of a difference there is between a good enough approach vs what someone would do if they were really looking for that completely optimized approach (I’d be in the first category).</p>

<p>I remember a study from awhile ago that showed a lot of variability in muscle growth after a single weight training session. Some people would gain all the muscle they would ever grow within 24 hours, while others would continue to add muscle for 7 days after a single session. </p>

<p>For that first group, you’d think even 24 hour bulk vs cut cycles would work. They’d be in surplus for 24 hours while they build muscle and could be in deficit for a day before starting again.</p>

<div class="md"><p>24 hour cycles doesn’t make sense given how MPS works and growing the day after the stimulus.</p>

<div class="md"><p>How long after resistance training does the growth stimulus last?</p>

<p>I did find this paper:</p>

<p>J Nutr . 2011 Apr 1;141(4):568-73. doi: 10.3945/jn.110.135038. Epub 2011 Feb 2.</p>

<p>Enhanced amino acid sensitivity of myofibrillar protein synthesis persists for up to 24 h after resistance exercise in young men</p>

<p>I don&#39;t know if anyone has looked at the exercise induced impact on MPS after 24 hours.</p>

<div class="md"><p>It’s not keto related, but Dr Mike Israetel and colleagues have done some research on optimal “diet” length.</p>

<p>As I recall, 12-16 weeks tends to be the “limit” on cut cycles, with diminishing returns beyond ~week 12. Optimal is 6-10 weeks. </p>

<p>Similar times for mass cycles, with the optimal time range being slightly longer at 8-12 weeks.</p>

<p>There’s probably some stuff on his YouTube channel.</p>
