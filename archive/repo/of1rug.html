<div class="md"><p>Performance enhancing for certain sports, for Olympic Sprinting I can’t see how it is “performance enhancing” other than allowing a larger appetite and as a sleep aid, yet Caffeine will probably have a much larger performance enhancing effect but is allowed</p>

<div class="md"><p>I think most people have no problem calling it NON Performance Enhancing is because the majority of people perform worse when high, myself included. I can&#39;t even imagine performing better at anything except losing track of time when high.</p>

<p>I have no data to back up that &quot;majority&quot; though, I&#39;m not going to act like I do. That&#39;s just my opinion on why people don&#39;t consider performance enhancing</p>

<div class="md"><p>Clearly that’s just your specific experience.  As someone who has smoked a ton of pot and also someone who has lived most recently not smoking at all, my mental horsepower quadruples without pot.  My ability to think very quickly and react spontaneously is 1,000% at its peak when I’m sober.  To each their own though.</p>
