<div class="md"><p>Eh my last 3 short walks were .44 miles. All around 7.5 minutes. I burned 50 calories on average. </p>

<p>But your point is definitely valid that even if that 10 minute walk burned 100 calories, that is completely wiped out by 1 soda. </p>

<p>Or that 100 calorie deficit would lose you a ~ pound in about a month. Or ~12 pounds a year. Which doesn’t sound bad, but, people want results now. Not in a year. People want to lose weight much faster, and will become discouraged with the slow progress.</p>

<div class="md"><p>Just don’t eat as much.</p>

<p>Why do people need pills? Just lay off the calories. It’s literally calories in and calories out (that’s not personal feeling or anecdotal, that’s scientific fact.)</p>

<p>I just don’t get it.</p>

<p>Edit: a lot of people pointing out they don’t have self control or something similar because food is their addiction. I hear you and I’m sorry that is the case.</p>

<p>However, it doesn’t change the formula</p>

<p>Cal intake - (maintenance cals + active cals) = net cals</p>

<p>Positive net, weight gain. Negative net, weight loss.</p>

<p>Those numbers may add up differently person to person but the + or - at the end of the formula is still the end result.</p>

<p>It all ends with individual accountability, hard work, and some combo of diet and or exercise.</p>

<div class="md"><p>I get what you’re saying, and it’s totally true. However there are usually myriad other issues at play.</p>

<p>Depression is a hell of a thing. Anxiety as well. Low income people live in food deserts where only local food available is fast food or snacks/sugar. </p>

<p>I got stuck working from home last year and a half. No space for home gym, stopped walking to train (was 3 miles of walking to/fro 5 days a week), sitting at computer all day and next thing I know I put on 20-25 lbs in no time. Booze definitely contributed.</p>

<p>That’s with (other than the booze) a pretty healthy diet otherwise. People who don’t have the same resources to eat healthy, it’s very easy to put on a lot of weight you carry around for a long time.</p>

<p>If I could take a pill that causes my body to prioritize burning fat, I totally would be on board.  Only just now getting back to gym, and it’s a lot harder to shed weight when you’re over 40.</p>

<div class="md"><p>Why would you think the body in starvation mode would burn fat before muscle? If your starving your body thinks it needs fat stores as the body doesn’t know when the next meal is coming. Your body wants to store fat in starvation mode and will deplete other energy stores first. Like muscle.</p>

<p>Edit: to the reply I can’t see b cause Apollo be like that.  </p>

<p>The human evolution for the ability to get food put a hell of a lot more into the brain then the muscle system. From an evolutionary perspective the body muscle system wants to be just big enough to out walk our prey to exhaustion, walk great distances to search for food or be slow burning as low as possible for as long as possible to wait for the opportunity to strike.   Human evolution also put a lot into the brain for recognition, memory, reasoning, and predicting the future.  A lot of high calorie hunting was hours of walking and coordination with others followed by seconds of high energy output. </p>

<p>So, The body wants to hold off on depleting fat stores during starvation for the required feeding of energy to the brain. For humans, The brain takes precedents over muscle in who get optimized to continue. Fat breaking down can feed the brain ( see ketosis), and muscle steals that fat away from the brain. muscle loses until the very end. </p>

<p>So  the body reduces muscle mass to reduce maintenance cost(burn rate) to prolong the brains viability.   Homeostasis be like that.</p>

<div class="md"><p>Even though calories in - calories out is a law, and the idea is simple, it’s not necessarily easy.</p>

<p>Breaking habits, especially if you have genetics that leads to lower satiety/more hunger than other people, it’s much easier to over eat. People who are not overweigth also tend to (uncouncioisly) increase spontaneous activity when they consume more calories. That can be shaking your leg, pacing around your house or other small physical activities.</p>

<p>It’s obviously possible to lose weight for everyone, but it’s it really isn’t easy.</p>

<p>That right there is a huge difference for different people. You compensate unconsciously by eating a little more some days and a little less other days. That&#39;s what keeping you at roughly the same weight. Obese people are really bad at that, so you can&#39;t tell them to &quot;eat until full&quot;.</p>

<p>I&#39;m guessing a lot of obese people were fat as kids too because they grew up with parents who fed them too much. If you&#39;re overweight your entire life it&#39;s much harder to change and maintain a new life style.</p>

<p>In any case. Weighing yourself every morning and counting calories is a great way to keep track of your weight, regardless of what you eat. Healthy food is obviously preferred but as long as you keep your calorie intake under control it&#39;s okay to eat bad food once in a while.</p>

<p>You&#39;re making a big assumption here: You&#39;re assuming that people eat because they want to put on weight. Although this was true for most of history, it is no longer the case: These days, many people eat simply because they enjoy eating: They don&#39;t necessarily want to put on weight <em>at all</em>.</p>

<p>In fact, many people now eat <em>just</em> because they enjoy eating, and they actually want to <em>lose</em> weight. As you can imagine, this is a problem: Some people who eat the right amount to make them happy also up eating the right amount to put on way more weight than they want.</p>

<p>This drug has the potential to solve that problem: Think if it as a birth-control pill that controls fat (interestingly, the necessity for that pill arose because many people have sex just because they enjoy sex, and not because they want to make a new person).</p>

<div class="md"><p>This quote seems important:</p>

<p>&quot;Studies that focused on people with extreme obesity have identified common gene variants—like a “broken” copy of the MC4R gene, linked to appetite regulation—that make people more likely to be overweight&quot;</p>

<p>Then this study goes on to observe the gene expression in comparison to weight. </p>

<p>Then they suppressed the overeating gene in mice. </p>

<p>A key point I&#39;d like to read more about is how they fed them. Was it unlimited food, which the non overeaters may have avoided (and thus gained less weight than their overeating peers) or was the quantity intake perfectly locked?</p>

<p>The body MUST burn calories from food for energy, muscle creation and when possible,  fat creation/storage. </p>

<p>If the mice had exactly the same food intake (force fed?) Then I am quite curious where the &quot;dark&quot; caloric energy is coming or going. Are the non-overweight mice running a higher temp or something?</p>

<p>Calories in - calories out is still a physical law nothing can circumvent. If you eat ledd than you burn, you will lose weight. But it’s not easy.</p>

<p>Just saying «eat less» is like telling a drug addict to «just stop doing drugs».</p>

<div class="md"><p>&gt;You don&#39;t have any proof of that</p>

<p>That&#39;s literally how math works it&#39;s physics not up for debate.</p>

<p>&gt;The gene could alter how many calories you extract from certain foods</p>

<p>That&#39;s a different argument and fairly salient. We don&#39;t all absorb the same amount of calories from everything. That&#39;s a part of being a smart well adjusted adult. If I eat a carrot and get 2 calories out of it and you eat it and get 500 you need to adjust</p>

<p>Again it wouldn&#39;t make counting USELESS it would just make it slightly different for each individual</p>

<p>The over all formula is calories in - TDEE (total daily energy expenditure). If that number is a positive you will gain weight if it is negative you will lose. No matter your genetics or any medical condition.</p>

<div class="md"><p>“This looks like a reasonably portioned meal” says hungry brain. </p>

<p>Too bad in America specifically, that stuff is intentionally drenched in various types of sugars which not only add more calories to what might have otherwise been mostly reasonable, but sugar is intensely addictive. </p>

<p>But America hates government interference, so let the companies drench things in cheap, addictive sugars for profit. It’s the citizens’ fault for being uneducated (despite going to school) and eating unhealthy (when even salads are an unhealthy option at fast food places, but a lot of people don’t know that unless they obsessively check ingredients and calorie counts).</p>

<p>So, I see where you’re coming from, and with a lot more effort people can totally overcome it, many of us are too overworked to really check into things, or cook. So I see the other side, too.</p>

<div class="md"><p>Yes it helps to burn fat. You can literally eat only twinkies and lose fat if you eat few enough. There is even a documentary about it. But it’s not easy or suistainable for most people because weighing everything you eat is stressful.</p>

<p>Also, I highly doubt that most people who struggle with weight are very focused on macros and fibre in the first place. Losing weight is one of the best things you can do for your general health if you are overweigth.</p>

<p>A much easier diet to follow is to eat more fibre rich fruits and vegetables, whole pieces of meat or fish and carbs that are more filling(brown rice, potatoes, sweet potatoes, beans) rather than only pasta and white rice. You would still not lose weight id you eat as many calories, but it’s just easier to eat less as it’s much more filling.</p>

<div class="md"><p>One thing that might make food addiction harder to quit: almost everyone enables it. If you&#39;re a heroin addict, your friends and family aren&#39;t likely to let you shoot up in their house. They&#39;re not going to offer you syringes, and they&#39;re definitely not going to have a big bowl of heroin siting on the kitchen table for you when you come over. </p>

<p>With food, it&#39;s different. If you&#39;re obese, people will gladly load up that metaphorical food syringe and help you inject it straight into your piehole until you die from heart disease. And this is not only acceptable, it&#39;s considered polite.</p>

<div class="md"><p>Food is also a mood stabilizer for many people, it’s really not just about calories in or out when the food is a coping mechanism for other issues. </p>

<p>I do worry about this kind of medication leading to transfer addiction, the way weight loss surgery often does. I would love to see a study on how many people become alcoholics or have other transfer addictions after bariatric surgery.</p>

<div class="md"><p>You are factually incorrect. You&#39;re way too easily sidestepping the fact that the body is a hoarder when it comes to calories. We&#39;re programmed to favour calorie dense food. If you try to lose weight too rapidly the body will act as if there&#39;s a famine and try to return you to a set weight. Moreover, your gut biome heavily influences the kind of food you&#39;ll go for and how efficiently it&#39;s digested. If people were a calorimeter you&#39;d be right, but you&#39;re dealing with an organism that evolved under caloric deficiency that&#39;s suddenly thrust into a high caloric availability. Thus your statement is so factually incorrect that it&#39;s misleading.</p>

<p>Okay, so i need to burn more. Well, that’s kinda hard after shattering an ankle while playing rugby. </p>

<p>You’re trying to say there is always an answer but there sometimes isn’t. People have stressful jobs that don’t pay well. They spend the entire day at work resulting in them not being able to workout afterwards and just go to bed. I’m another example of that, in college i started up my own company. There are times I’ve had to go 3 days without sleeping let alone going out for a swim.</p>

<div class="md"><p>In theory that is correct. And that would work wonderfully for people in a coma or for people who are not in control of what they eat. But for many there is also the aspect of will power and in some cases even addiction involved. The mental state is crucial for the ability to limit yourself in order to lose weight.

<p>I am have no clear diagnosis so thier is no clear treatment plan. Combine this with a severe dissociative personality disorder if I try fasting I will sleep eat. My body will literally override my free will and eat raw ingredients because I am always hungry. </p>

<div class="md"><p>mhh big pharma made <a href="https://bigthink.com/politics-current-affairs/cancer-drugs-most-profitable?rebelltitem=2#rebelltitem2">240</a> bio in PROFIT in 2018 for everything related to cancer. While 42% of cancer patients lose their entire live savings. </p>

<p>lets assume a we get a cancer &quot;wonder pill&quot;, a one time treatment that does something fancy to improve the bodies natural cancer response that gets rid of 99% of all cancers.</p>

<p>How and why do you think they are gonna replace that profit? A one time treatment compared to years or even livetime long medication. Even if you really pump up the price and give it out to everyone while getting big govt subsidies for &quot;vaccinating&quot; all citizens against cancer. I cannot see it approaching nearly that number YOY.</p>

<p>Sure that conspiracy is of course nonsense but they are often based on a logical core, which is why they are so convincing to many. And don´t forget, we are talking about people who wanted to &quot;just take the pain away&quot; and created the opium crisis.</p>

<p>But maybe you have an explaination that breaks the fundamentals of this conspircay. The profit calculation.</p>

<p>Example: even if we have the one time cost be 10k and give it to all americans 350mx10k=3.5 trio REVENUE. lets assume its all profit, that would be 14,5 years of Profit from 2018 numbers. Thats not much. Year over year their profits will drop hard. Especially since not everyone is gonna get it or is able to afford it.</p>

<div class="md"><p>I get a lot of side eyes for this, but i believe that while the principal of CICO is not wrong, it does not tell the whole story. Different bodies react differently to different foods; 100 calories of vegetables is NOT the same as 100 calories of cake for many people, and based on gut flora and blood sugar can promote your body metabolizing these differently.</p>

<p>The difference is insulin. Eating in a way that results in high insulin results in growth of body tissues, as insulin is both lipogenic and anabolic. Constant high insulin levels over time leads to T2 diabetes.</p>

Your last paragraph also probably explains your missing perspective.
There is a lot of causes for obesity that aren’t simply related to overconsumption (missing mobility, thyroid issues, child obesity carrying into adulthood, access to quality food, etc). Fixing these would greatly improve peoples lives and reduce the cost burden on society.
Obviously you‘d still need to keep a somewhat balanced diet anyways because obesity is just the most visible but by far not the only health

<div class="md"><p>Kind of true. </p>

<p>People have variance in Leptin levels. If your body produces too much or too little, or if your receptors are shot, then good luck trying to maintain weight. </p>

<p>Worst yet, the production of Leptin is regulated by the amount of body fat you have. So if you’re resistant, and you lose weight, it gets harder. </p>

<p>You can only consistently exercise for so long or so much. It’s a long fight and ultimately the person loses to the body. </p>

<p>I look at it the same way as an opioid addict with shot mu-receptors. The brain for an opioid ceases to produce its own dopamine or the dopamine receptors die off due lack of use because of external opioids. </p>

<p>So yes, there’s a certain degree of laziness in some people but that’s not the main issue. Obesity is an addiction problem, and worst yet, there’s evidence that it’s an inheritable addiction.</p>

<div class="md"><p>It&#39;s not kinda true, it <em>is</em> true.</p>

<p>People have variance in leptin levels due to their overall eating habits. The longer they overeat, the more resistant they become. It is a chicken and egg scenario. But changing their eating habits/being more physically active will break the cycle. To do that, they need to change their lifestyle and bad habits</p>

<div class="md"><p>That’s where we disagree. I put kind of because you put more emphasis and faith on exercise. I think laziness and life style plays a very minor role. </p>

<p>And its not necessarily a chicken and egg scenario. We know some people have leptin issues from genetics, and we know others have leptin issues from a bad life style (probably from not understanding, poverty, or excessive work hours) that short circuited their receptors for leptin. The end result is the same: a complicated addiction problem that has a lot less to do with laziness and willpower than people attribute. </p>

<p>You assume that exercise is a solution people haven’t tried. Most people tried exercise, and had at least a few spurts of consistency in their life, and eventually they lose to the leptin issue. </p>

<p>I’m willing to bet the majority of obese people have tried many time’s in life to willpower out of obesity. It’s a losing fight for most people. </p>

<p>The successful ones often didn’t have as bad of leptin issues or had a massive change in environment that allowed for the breaking of the cycle. Like going to boot camp or fat camp where your environment is either controlled or completely focused on weight loss that it makes it easy. </p>

<p>We don’t tell opioid addicts to change their doping habits or lifestyles as if that’s the only part of the issue. We recognize that opioid addicts have issues with specific receptors and productions of specific hormones that they’re basically fighting a losing battle without extreme support. Like rehab. </p>

<p>I think if you put all the obese people in America in a controlled environment like a boot camp away from their daily stress and struggles and let them focus on weight loss and resetting the addiction, the vast majority of them will work hard. You might have 5-25% that don’t want to put the work, whatever. It’s still not the main barrier. </p>

<p>People need to recognize the issue of addiction here and stop adding judgment on top of it.</p>

<div class="md"><p>There are reasonable ways to get more healthy food to more people and we should support these efforts.<br/>
But cows already take up 800 million acres in the U.S.<br/>
(that some of us wouldn&#39;t mind living on- reducing housing prices with new sustainable communities with gardens and aquaponics and healthy food for everyone..),<br/>
and cows spew disasterous amounts of methane that traps heat 80x better than C02.. raises sea levels and causes floods and hurricanes and fires and droughts.. that effect the poor disproportionately.<br/>
If obesity reduction turns into a &#39;free pass&#39; to eat whatever at whatever amounts,  doubling the cow population? that would be a disaster- way more (skinny) people forced from small towns or burned or flooded.. crammed into crappy $6,000 / month apartments by the freeways.<br/>
So a magic obesity reduction pill has to be accompanied with education and efforts into eco-social ethical / sustainable consumption.</p>

<div class="md"><p>I won&#39;t say you&#39;re completely wrong, but this comment seems like a vegan misdirection and I&#39;m gonna call you out for it. Generally, it&#39;s not the protein rich meat that&#39;s causing people to be fat; it&#39;s carbs. If such a medicine would lead to more overconsumption, it&#39;s far more likely that the biggest increase in consumption we&#39;ll see will be of sugar and other high-carb foods. This sudden topic switch to cows was a bit forced.</p>

<p>As others have mentioned, it&#39;s not as simple as gluttony either. Many people can&#39;t afford to only eat sustainable food. For some, it&#39;s literally a choice between going hungry or eating the cheapest, most processed crap they can find on sale.</p>

<p>Not even gonna touch your rant about small apartments. You kind of went off the rails a bit with that whole what-if doomsday scenario.</p>

<div class="md"><p>Another comment brought up poverty / obesity and food deserts,</p>

<p>but bad housing / bad food conditions are not a law of nature,</p>

<p>but land use is a zero sum game (unless there are increased efficiencies)- if more people are over-consuming with existing diets and agricultural conditions, there&#39;s more competition for agricultural and pasture land -&gt; increased human overcrowding, rent prices, poverty, crappy neighborhoods without markets or gardens.</p>

<p>Or work to educate about eco-social impact and ethics and reduce consumption, particularly of the most egregious land-hogs -</p>

<p>I&#39;m not vegan, though nothing against, but (currently) 800 million acres for cows and cow food while humans live in poverty and are malnourished, seems a simple trade. Other protein sources are available and more efficient, switch to chicken, please, other sources are more efficient - and would free up more land for better neighborhoods with gardens and markets and lower housing and rent prices.</p>

<p>A cure for lung cancer would be great. But if people started smoking more for fun, to the tune of 800 million acres or more for tobacco fields.. (while a significant number of humans lived in poverty and malnutrition) - we might want to have a talk about eco-social impact. </p>

<p>Super cool to introduce a cure for obesity, what&#39;s step 2?</p>

<div class="md"><p>Yes and you&#39;re the only valid person in the world. </p>

<p>If someone has a gambling addiction well too bad they&#39;re not <a href="/u/OptiKal_">/u/OptiKal_</a>  with their perfect parents. Their failings are their own fault, and any exploitative businesses should be free to have them gamble away their money, home and kidneys.</p>

<p>If tobacco companies give children a few free cigerettes to get them addicted, well too bad they weren&#39;t  <a href="/u/OptiKal_">/u/OptiKal_</a>  with their perfect parents. The addiction is their own damn fault and tobacco companies should be free to profit from them.</p>

<p>Companies target weaknesses to sell product, and will do so as long as it&#39;s profitable for them, and it will be profitable for them for far longer than it is desirable for society because companies don&#39;t have to bear the cost of negative externalities that come with their products. They don&#39;t pay for lung cancer treatments, they don&#39;t pay for a lifelong supply of insulin, they don&#39;t pay for all the trillions of dollars of damage global warming will cause. </p>

<p>In not having companies pay the complete costs of whatever products they sell  we are all effectively subsidizing them.</p>

<p>No, this is definitively not controversial in the medical field. Nutrient deficiencies typically operate on a time scale that far exceeds the amount of time you can live without calories. Without fat you will break down protein stores to maintain your brain and heart function, and at that point you cannot last long.</p>

<div class="md"><p>My friend has been saying the same thing for the past 2-3 years while I&#39;ve started to gain weight. But when we moved in together 4-5 months ago for studies, I started eating the same things as him and I&#39;m not gaining weight. What he thinks is a normal amount of food/snacks is far less than I would consider an average amount. I&#39;ve started losing weight after moving in with him. For a majority of people that say this I believe it&#39;s just that their perspective of &quot;eating much&quot; is in fact not much at all.

<div class="md"><p>Actually, that still applies. In fact, this study supports it.  You have to find that level where you start gaining or losing.  In the article it said mice with the mutation gained 44 percent less weight eating a high fat diet.  So your calories in and my calories in could vastly differ (assuming all else equal) to gain or lose weight. </p>

<p>The idea is imprecise of course, but there are general levels for each person where you start to gain or lose weight.  All you have to do is look at the extremes.  0 calories we are all losing weight. 10000 calories most of us are gaining weight.</p>

<p>Essentially, cut back calories until you start losing weight. Increase calories until you start gaining weight.</p>

<p>Basel metabolic rate is a variable that can change significantly with changes in diet.  To suggest that it is calories in/calories out is to claim that the body sees 100 calories of jelly beans in the same way that it sees 100 calories of almonds.</p>

<p>What you eat, how you eat it and when you eat it matter a great deal.  As does genetics.</p>

<p>And no, I am not a fat slob (anymore).  In fact my family doctor is very pleased with my current state.   What I am is a diet controlled Type 2 diabetic with blood work that now puts me the low risk group for heart disease.   A1c 5.3, triglycerides 54, weight down 35 pounds and so on.  So I can tell you from personal experience that it is everything BUT Calories in/calories out.</p>

<div class="md"><p>No, the main reason it works is that you won’t feel as much hunger because your blood sugar levels will be extremely stable and you will use ketones as fuel. This will sypress you hunger long-term. But it’s also no scientific evidence, or weak at best, that this diet is better than other diets long term. The reason why people typically lose loads of weight fast when going on keto-esque diets is because carbohydrate holds a lot of water in your body. Long term, the best diet is the one you can personally stick to.</p>

<p>Studies actually show the opposite of what you suggest: fat causing less satiety than carbs, but this is inconsistent. It seems rather safe to say that there is at least not much difference there between carbs and fats. <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK53550/">https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK53550/</a></p>

<p>Not feeling hunger is also not the same as feeling full. Protein and fibre satiete the most.</p>

<p>Used to drink weight gainers and eat cheesecake before bed to try and gain weight, my brothers were the same way. Finally at 42 my metabolism has slowed enough that I&#39;m now a normal weight and no longer super skinny.</p>

<p>I&#39;ve always found this topic interesting, there was a really good mini-doc on BBC back in 2009 called &quot;Why Are Thin People Not Fat?&quot; that looked at people like me and what was different.</p>

<p>The interesting take away for me was that some of us burn that energy off through mechanisms like thermogenesis and fidgeting.</p>

<p>They took a very scientific approach doing all sorts of measurements on these people.</p>

<div class="md"><p>If you weren&#39;t gaining weight, you weren&#39;t eating enough.  There isn&#39;t a gene that can defy thermodynamics.</p>

<p>The title of this article is going to lead many people to the wrong conclusion.  There&#39;s no gene that allows you to eat 10,000 calories of candy every day and not gain weight.  What  genes do influence, however, is behavior - hunger, satiation, physical activity, etc.  <em>These</em> are the factors that cause some people to stay &#39;naturally&#39; thin without any conscious effort.</p>

<p>Your passive metabolism is an insignificant part of your energy use each day (relative to weight differences), and no gene alteration is going to change that.  Behavior is the key variable.  We already have drugs that can cause an increase to your passive metabolism, but they come with severe side effects such as dramatically increased body temperature which comes with a whole host of problems (see:  DNP).  Why?  Because there&#39;s no gene that creates a black hole inside your body in which energy can just disappear, so that extra energy is being burned off for no real purpose and it effectively cooks you from the inside (I&#39;m being hyperbolic here, but that&#39;s the gist).  Fat gain/loss is all about energy, and it can&#39;t just disappear or come from nowhere.</p>

<div class="md"><p>Yeah most people arent consistently eating in a caloric surplus to gain weight in these situations.  They don’t track anything so they really wouldn’t know. </p>

<p>For instance I had a client that kept gaining weight and the meals were small and very dense in calories. He lived off of burritos, hostess treat snacks and pizza. Said he barely ate. Very sedentary lifestyle on top of eating high calorie dense foods low in volume. And drank a lot of beer. </p>

<p>We went over his daily intake of food and he was pushing out about 4K calories a day on average. He was very shocked. Of course he didn’t change his habits and still continues to eat like a dumpster. </p>

<p>Anecdotally. A friend mentions quite often he&#39;s going for a cheeky kfc run, and if others judged based on the this they may think he has a super metabolism. In reality, he rarely eats breakfast and forgets to eat lunch ever other day almost.</p>

<div class="md"><p>A buddy of mine talks about how he&#39;ll eat a 6&quot; sub from subway for lunch and just forget to eat for the rest of the day. Another will say &quot;Eh, I&#39;m feeling fat today&quot; and order a second entree because he feels like it.</p>

<p>I honestly can&#39;t even comprehend that. I don&#39;t even feel like I have a crazy appetite, but I swear I could down 4000 calories a day without even thinking about it. Losing the weight I put on during covid (~20lbs up, 18lbs down) has been hell because it legitimately feels like I&#39;m starving myself at some point every day despite averaging 1800cals/day. I exercise every day because it keeps my TDEE up and I can afford to eat more.</p>

<p>On the other hand, I have another friend. He struggles to eat 3000 calories in a day, but his level of muscle mass requires 4000/day in order to bulk any more. He frequently talks about how he doesn&#39;t know how he&#39;s supposed to eat another 800 calories in a day when it&#39;s already 11pm.</p>

<p>We have the exact same problem, just in opposite directions. My body constantly begs me for more food, and his is constantly telling him he&#39;s had enough. We both track calories and our results match our calorie counts. I swear people will forever try to find the one trick that allows them to eat whatever they want all the time without gaining weight but the answer is always the second law of thermodynamics (or laxatives that prevent your body from fully absorbing the calories / bulimia).</p>

<div class="md"><p>Not really true. I’m one of these people and though I don’t eat a lot at <em>one time</em>, I eat wayy over the daily caloric recommendation <em>throughout the day</em>. I’ve weighed the same throughout most of my life, only been able to gain ~15 pounds in the past 20 years. I’ve tried mass gainer protein, peanut butter, banana, etc. to try to gain weight, especially when I went through my fitness phase. Nothing really works. I also used to only eat fast food every single day when I worked in the office at an IT job.</p>

<div class="md"><p>I’m exactly like you, except the complete opposite.</p>

<p>I eat very little but put on fat instantly. If I want to lose weight I have to starve myself - which I have done. Now I’m just accepted that I will only find the middle ground. For more then 8 years I’ve been still eating very little and I’m still very obese. I track my calories and have been extremely disciplined about what I consume because if I eat anything that goes beyond what my daily caloric amount is I instantly put on weight. There is no in-betweens. I’m now essentially vegetarian with the only other source of protein being egg whites and still stuck unable to lose much beyond my current obese weight.</p>

<div class="md"><p>My husband is the same; you literally have to starve him before his body will drop a single pound and if he does manage to lose weight the second he eats above starving levels he puts the weight back on. I think it&#39;s because he has such a slow heartrate that he hardly burns any calories. He had an EKG and the doctors there couldn&#39;t even raise his heart rate on the treadmill and threatened him with ephedrine to raise it.</p>

<div class="md"><p>My late paternal grandmother had the most miraculous metabolism.</p>

<p>She lived to nearly 100 years old, and had probably the worst diet of anyone I knew.  I honestly can&#39;t remember her eating any vegetables - unless they were smothered in cheese - had meals that were almost entirely comprised of saturated fats and starch, she was a maintenance alcoholic and lover of Coca-Cola (NOT diet), and could hoover a plate of fries or a bowl of potato chips without breaking stride.  Exercise was the occasional &quot;brisk walk&quot;...but in stilettos they weren&#39;t that brisk, nor were they long.  (Oh, yeah - she was a chain smoker from 16-76, too.)</p>

<p>She was trim until the day she died...and loved nothing more than to note to my mother or myself  around a faceful of cheeseburger &quot;Isn&#39;t that an awfully large salad?&quot;  (Usually with dressing on the side, and we would be drinking unsweetened iced tea or ice waterto her super-sized Coke.)</p>

<p>That my mother - who ate so carefully, was incredibly active, and yet still couldn&#39;t lose weight (until massive chemo treatments) - died only a few years after she did of a horrendously aggressive colon cancer still makes me want to throw breakable things at a large brick wall.</p>

<div class="md"><p>Maybe... but genetics can gift us with the ability to worry less about that. Even when I go through periods that are overwhelmingly sedentary and don&#39;t maintain a healthy diet, my body weight hasn&#39;t fluctuated by more than 10lbs in the last 20 years (40 now) and is smack in the middle of healthy BMI.

And we&#39;ve seen the epigenetic effects of e.g. the Dutch hunger winter play out.

But yea it seems easy, calories in and calories out, when you&#39;re a young male. The weight just falls off with some effort.

<div class="md"><p>Sure, and many people also are that little bit overweight compared to what&#39;s considered to be a good weight or fit. You&#39;d also think that some of these effects may be cumulative, and if you&#39;re genetically someone that&#39;s satiated less and puts on weight more easily, that&#39;s the type of thing that requires constant supervision and control- the kind someone with different genetics wouldn&#39;t have to worry about while they tell people to &#39;just eat less&#39;. I&#39;m saying this as someone within a healthy BMI range. Quite a lot of people could do with a lot more understanding. Plenty grew up with healthy diets and active parents and took on that lifestyle. Plenty had good outside role models and access to good food. And yes, plenty of people overcame various barriers to losing weight and reached that healthy weight, and that&#39;s an accomplishment because of those barriers. I&#39;m just tired of the attitude that some people who have always been fit have.</p>

<div class="md"><p>In making my comment I was saying that some people have to have that discipline while others just naturally don&#39;t have issues with excess weight or are regulated differently so they have less of an appetite/feel full earlier/etc. My whole point was that while you can simplify it down to calories in and calories out, there are a whole lot of things affecting someone&#39;s ability to either take calories in or burn calories off- see the opposite side with some people genuinely struggling to put weight on. Discipline is great, but loads of people don&#39;t need that discipline while others do, and it is an extra thing to think about and consider or an extra stress if you want to say it that way. I just want people to stop being such asses to others. I&#39;ve lost weight and gained over the the years, and currently I&#39;m at a healthy weight. I&#39;m just damn tired of hearing people who have never had to deal with that having such horrible attitudes to those who have and those who continue to struggle.</p>

<div class="md"><p>Here&#39;s your problem: accidentally eating more calories than you burn. Take responsibility. Monitor yourself. It&#39;s hard, sure, but you&#39;re still eating more than you should, and that is your fault, not society&#39;s fault. Is there terrible food everywhere? Yes. Do you have to eat it? No. It&#39;s on you, every time. Bar none.</p>

<div class="md"><p>Oh yeah I thought it went without saying, but don&#39;t eat pre-packaged, processed, crap foods either. Obviously that makes it harder to actually count calories. And obviously what&#39;s on the package is an estimation
 so it&#39;s up to the person eating to plan accordingly and make sure the error limits are still in your calorie range.</p>

<div class="md"><p>Yes. The article says they&#39;ve found a gene that makes you not want to eat so many calories if you have it.</p>

<div class="md"><p>That doesn&#39;t change the fact that the interesting answer is the non-trivial one.</p>

<p>To the question &quot;Why is this person poor?&quot;, The answer &quot;They don&#39;t earn enough money&quot; is unsatisfactory because it is trivial to the point of redundancy.</p>

<p>It doesn&#39;t explain <em>why</em> they don&#39;t earn enough. Is it their personal situation? The state of society? Bad luck?</p>

<div class="md"><p>It&#39;s the &quot;burning more&quot; part that&#39;s grossly oversimplified here. Considering that most of the calories we burn in a day is completely passive. Different bodies burn calories at different rates, there is obviously a genetic component involved here. Not to mention a mental health aspect - having an anxiety disorder could put your body always in survival mode, purposefully trying to store fat and reserve calorie burn as much as possible.</p>

<div class="md"><p>Starvation mode is a myth. Only in extreme cases of malnutrition is &quot;survival mode&quot; a thing, and in that case the body literally starts breaking down muscle tissue and cannibalising itself to keep vital organs working. Metabolism does not swing that drastically. Your body cannot disregard thermodynamics at will.</p>
