<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><h1>What is the maximum number of eggs I can eat while on a ketogenic diet?</h1>

<p>You can eat as many eggs and keto diets as you like! Keep your macronutrient and calorie counts under control, especially if you are trying to lose weight. No matter what diet you are on, maintaining a consistent calorie deficit will be key to weight loss.</p>

<p>Some people, who are both avid keto-eaters and egg lovers, report eating as many as 30 eggs per day! This would give you around 2100 calories, 150g of fat, 180g protein, and 20g carbs. It&#39;s not far from the numbers recommended above.</p>

<p>However, the majority of people don&#39;t eat 30 eggs per day. This means that you can eat eggs all day, but it is difficult. We can learn the most important lesson: eggs are great for ketogenic eating. If you are looking to add more eggs to your diet, it is worth setting a goal of 3 eggs per day, whether they are eaten alone or with other keto-friendly meals.</p>

<h1>What about cholesterol?</h1>

<p>The 186g of cholesterol found in egg yolks is a cause for concern. This is approximately 60% of the daily recommended intake, based on 2000 calories. For many years, people have been advised to limit their egg consumption to avoid this.</p>

<p>Numerous studies have shown that eggs contain only HDL cholesterol, which is the good kind. They rarely increase LDL (or the harmful kind of cholesterol).</p>

<p>You don&#39;t need to be concerned about cholesterol in eggs unless you have medical conditions that restrict your cholesterol intake. It&#39;s similar to the myth that fat is always harmful. This has been challenged by many of today&#39;s leading nutritional experts.</p>

<p>You don&#39;t have to remove the yolks from eggs to reduce cholesterol. It&#39;s not only the best place to get most of the eggs&#39; vitamins and minerals but it also contains the healthy fats that you need to eat a ketogenic diet. They are also the most delicious part of an egg!</p>

<div class="md"><p>Holy gee, I don’t think I’ve ever eaten the volumetric equivalent of 30 eggs worth of food in a single day, but I’ve probably eaten that many calories. That’s quite the visual.</p>

<div class="md"><p>I&#39;ve not heard of anyone having 30 eggs as a daily diet, that sounds like you&#39;re going to get micronutrient deficiencies by just relying on any food that much. </p>

<p>I had an ostrich egg omelette for Easter that&#39;s apparently the equivalent of 24 eggs, and that wasn&#39;t the only thing I had that day, wouldn&#39;t base a diet on it though. </p>

<p>Agree that eggs are a good keto food, you can get them pickled if you don&#39;t want to cook them all the time, eggs do contain everything necessary to grow a chicken so there&#39;s got to be good stuff in there.</p>
