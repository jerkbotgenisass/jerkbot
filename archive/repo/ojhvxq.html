<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Hey guys,just a quick question, i am 6ft2, 78 kilos atm and i have been going to the gym for about 8 years,of which i had many breaks and the most consistent i have been was for a year. I have been eating above my maintenance and i do a full body routine but I am noticing that i am having harder time gaining muscle, majority of the weight seem to be gained as fat. Even though I am only 78 kilos at that height and i have been going on and off for about 8 years,do i classify as an advanced lifter and therefore I have reached somewhat of a genetic limit in terms of building muscle?</p>

<div class="md"><p>You are 6&#39;2 and 78kg my dude, you might want to take a look at your nutrition and training if you think this is the genetic limit</p>

<div class="md"><p>Sounds like a case of fuckarounditis, to be honest. You are almost certainly <em>not</em> an advanced lifter if you&#39;re going off and on and doing full body workouts. You are also almost certainly nowhere even remotely close to a genetic limit at 78k. Refine your nutrition and get on a solid lifting plan.</p>

<div class="md"><p>No. There’s no amount of time that will make you an advanced lifter or whatever. An advanced lifter is generally classified by your lifts and the weight you can do on them, specifically the big 3. Bodyweight also has nothing to do with it. You’re 170lbs at 6’2”. You have plenty of growing left to do. You’re basically just starting. It’s like asking if you’re rich yet. If you have to ask, you’re not.</p>

<p>IDK what makes you think you&#39;re &quot;advanced&quot; or any where near your genetic limit, but it&#39;s super unlikely. If you&#39;re gaining mostly fat, it&#39;s probably because you&#39;re eating too much and gaining too quickly and/or your training needs some changes. How big is your caloric surplus and what program are you following?</p>

<div class="md"><p>This approach will do minimal for adding muscle.  By chance, do you not have access to barbells or a squat/power rack?</p>
