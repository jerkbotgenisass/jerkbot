<div class="md"><p>Once you reach the ground there’s no more weight pressing down or space to continue beyond that position. To get a deeper split you need both pressure and room to stretch. This is a pretty reliable way to practice that, and she’s clearly at a level of flexibility where that matters. There might be more space conscious ways to do the same, but if it’s a short stretch or an emptier gym, there’s no reason to scream across the internet at her for it.</p>

<p>Everyone in the video has masks, so it’s possible when this was filmed you literally wouldn’t be allowed to pack people any tighter. There was probably a limit on the number of people in the gym as well, which further reduces any pressure.</p>

<p>The video taker is standing near where the next bench would be, so there’s clearly no one there either. Her disinterest in the video could be because it’s purpose was to check her progress and form and share it with friends or whatever.</p>

<div class="md"><p>We have an unwritten law where I come from wich basicially is a commentary on our modern society, and how we all look down upon - and think lesser of people that are different. I feel that alot of subreddits have declined to this point. Written by a danish-norwegian writer Aksel Sandemosse. It is called &quot;the law of Jante&quot;, and these are the ten rules:</p>

<p>You&#39;re not to think you are anything special.</p>

<p>You&#39;re not to think you are as good as we are.</p>

<p>You&#39;re not to think you are smarter than we are.</p>

<p>You&#39;re not to imagine yourself better than we are.</p>

<p>You&#39;re not to think you know more than we do.</p>

<p>You&#39;re not to think you are more important than we are.</p>

<p>You&#39;re not to think you are good at anything.</p>

<p>You&#39;re not to laugh at us.</p>

<p>You&#39;re not to think anyone cares about you.</p>

<p>You&#39;re not to think you can teach us anything.</p>

<div class="md"><p>The pattern has more to do with the prevalence of subs meant to make fun of things. They usually start with good intentions, but inevitably run out of good content and become low effort factories. Everyone with good intentions gets annoyed and drifts off, leaving behind people who don’t set limits, maintain civility, or care about the impact of our indulgences. Sometimes the shift can be corrected by proactive communities. Other times the community branches in a never ending cycle of rebirths.</p>

<p>This sub is structured for that path. It gives posters permission to declare absolute hatred for whoever they please (like punchablefaces). If there isn’t a good crowd around to filter content, it will spiral downward.</p>

<p>The more successful teasing/mocking subreddits manage to assign positive value to their victims in a roundabout way. Like videos of people doing cool things as a result of stupid decisions (holdmybeer).</p>

<p>Sexuality infused subreddits have a similarly persistent undertone of unchecked indulgent behavior.</p>

<div class="md"><p>Sometimes I worry that too many of us have simply learned to take good videos and now everything looks suspiciously like last decade’s influencers. We spent so long getting burned that, now that there are healthier uses for networking and social media, we’re unable to believe sincerity when we see it.

<div class="md"><p>Great examples. Pretty much anyone who didn’t start using gyms as part of an organized sport will start out with little idea how to do everything.

<p>I looked her up on TikTok. It’s obvious that he’s part of a TikTok account where an attractive girl with a nice ass spreads her legs literally almost anywhere for views on the internet. It’s painfully obvious she does this for attention, not “she just needs a good stretch”. </p>

<p>And you can spare the dumb ass comments like the one further down suggesting I think cameraman doesn’t mind strictly because I wouldn’t. Well no shit. Take virtually any straight single man, and show him this girl. Tell him “hey, she wants to provocatively spread her ass apart literally like every day for her social media and she wants you to film it.” Something tells me, the guy that says yes and actually does it… probably doesn’t fucking mind.</p>

<div class="md"><p>There was a stretching area at my old gym had those jazzercise steps or foam blocks that you could stack and use for elevated stretches. </p>

<p>I&#39;m sure most gyms have the same thing especially considering I live in a small town and my gym was a YMCA that we shared with the next down over. </p>

<div class="md"><p>I spend a lot of time in the gym and when they are crowded It’s difficult to get a shot like this without someone walking in frame or Forcing the photographer to move.

<p>Evidence the gym is dead: </p>

<p>Nobody is passing by, nobody is grabbing dumbbells. It’s daytime. The sun is high. The person to the left is being trained, training sessions are often scheduled during non-peak hours. No passers by in the mirror either. The trainer doesn’t seem to give a fuck. The floors are spotless. The girl seems fairly comfortable despite looking silly. </p>
