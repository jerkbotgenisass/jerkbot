<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Hi community, </p>

<p>So the last few months I&#39;ve been running again. I&#39;m 35 and in my mid twenties I was putting in 40m 10K&#39;s. I did know a lot about training then, other than put the trainers on and run. Back then I&#39;d wake up every morning regardless of weather and do a local hilly 7 miles each day and that was that. Every now and again I&#39;d enter into a local 10K for fun and have a go. </p>

<p>&#x200B;</p>

<p>Looking back on it I wish I took it a bit more seriously and joined a running club! </p>

<p>&#x200B;</p>

<p>Anyway since then I&#39;ve done other stuff like weight training and cycling. The weight training was interesting, I really enjoyed it and based my sessions on 5 3 1 work outs which I found really effective - and I&#39;ve taken the principles of this and applied them to running. </p>

<p>&#x200B;</p>

<p>At the moment, I&#39;m overweight and can&#39;t run a 10k from start to finish without walking in between. So my recent training has been running and walking, and slowly building it up. Nothing too strenuous but just building back the strength in my joints and ligaments to be able to go for longer runs etc. </p>

<p>&#x200B;</p>

<p>My long term goal is to hit a 10K in 40 minutes again. I&#39;m miles off it (excuse the pun), I know I am, but it&#39;s a long term goal which I think is achievable over the next 2/3 years if I train smart. This is where the 5 3 1 method is coming in. </p>

<p>&#x200B;</p>

<p>Now, if you google the 5 3 1 method you&#39;ll find a load of stuff about weight lifting. Basically you calculate your 1 rep max and then from that develop work out regime where you do 5 x 65%, 5 x 75%, 5 x 85% one week, 3 x 70%, 3 x 80%, 3 x 90% another week, etc. After a given period of time you increase the 1rm slowly.  So the principle is long steady and sustainable progress. </p>

<p>&#x200B;</p>

<p>So in my experiment I&#39;ve first thought to define what my 1RM for running is. I thought of a few things, in weight lifting form is really important for sustainable development, and it is in running too. So, I thought my 1RM in running would be a period of time where I could maintain good running form at a given speed. </p>

<p>&#x200B;</p>

<p>Because I&#39;m just getting back into running, and because I decided to go zero-drop I&#39;m running really short intervals anyway and building up, so I chose a fairly fast pace. Because my target time is a 40 minute 10K and I want to hold that in my mind and make my sessions meaningful, it made sense to see where the 4 min/km pace would get me. </p>

<p>&#x200B;</p>

<p>I found an old school all weather sports track near my house and started to see how I&#39;d get on. I did 5 4 min/km efforts with 2 minute recovery in-between and I averaged 60 seconds of good running form across the five efforts. I checked my heart rate and I was just about hitting 160bpm after each effort which is another indicator I guess, but I want my focus to be on running form to guide my training so to keep injuries in check. </p>

<p>&#x200B;</p>

<p>I think it&#39;s a good safe start for me to work out a training plan now </p>

<p>&#x200B;</p>

<p>So my first session I&#39;ve worked out I&#39;ll be doing:</p>

<p>&#x200B;</p>

<p>(65%) 39s x 5 intervals </p>

<p>(75%) 45s x 5 </p>

<p>(85%) 51s x 4</p>

<p>51s+ x 1</p>

<p>&#x200B;</p>

<p>my second session is looking like</p>

<p>&#x200B;</p>

<p>(70%) 42s x 3 </p>

<p>(80%) 48s x 3</p>

<p>(90%) 54s x 2</p>

<p>54s+ x 1</p>

<p>&#x200B;</p>

<p>my third session is looking like </p>

<p>&#x200B;</p>

<p>45s x 5 </p>

<p>51s x 3</p>

<p>57s+ x 1</p>

<p>&#x200B;</p>

<p>So what I&#39;m doing here is trying to change the split times to manage the training load.  I&#39;ll try my best to maintain a 4min/km pace over that period. </p>

<p>After each interval I&#39;ll be doing a 2 min rest which will be walking for now. I imagine I&#39;ll change that to very slow jogging.</p>

<p>The 5 3 1 method sessions in weight lifting are designed to be weekly sessions. Now I&#39;m planning on doing these sessions over the course of a week or two depending on how I find it recovery wise. </p>

<p>At the end of each phase my plan is to increase the time by 15% but I plan on monitoring this change depending on the running form indicator I&#39;m using. </p>

<p>I&#39;m also including a long session at the weekend where I do some easy miles, again run walk.</p>

<p>&#x200B;</p>

<p>I&#39;m hopeful this is going to work for me. It&#39;s got a progressive element to it. I feel like I&#39;m doing something fairly novel, but also I&#39;m doing something individualised to my personal running fitness. I found a lot of websites just have basic protocols which don&#39;t offer much scope for individualisation and therefore don&#39;t really consider injury prevention. And even though I&#39;m overweight, I still want to train smart and build up to a target. Hopefully this will be a good method for pretty much anyone to start with. </p>

<p>&#x200B;</p>

<p>I&#39;ll keep this updated with how I get on!</p>

<div class="md"><p>What actual running programs did you look at? It seems weird to me that you have faith in a weight lifting program but then think all run training programs somehow are not compatible with you. They are completely different disciplines working different systems of your body. I can guarantee if you keep doing your training plan you will not get results and will likely injure yourself.</p>

<p>I really recommend reading Jack Daniel&#39;s running formula. It will explain the methodology of training and why all the workouts are designed as such. Understanding all of this will really help your training.</p>

<div class="md"><p>Thanks for the advice, but I&#39;m gonna see how I get on with it and change things as I go. I&#39;m conscious of injury which is why I wanted to do something that had an element of listening to my body to it and working within my limits. I enjoy doing the intervals, and I think I&#39;d see some progressive changes from this, especially early on and I&#39;m happy if the changes are slow. </p>

<p>The programs I&#39;ve looked at were all very arbitrary ie. slowly building up the mileage week on week. I&#39;ve done interval training before especially on the road bike, so things like wingates, tabata, SITs REHIT and various hit protocols.</p>

<p>I think that this approach blends a lot of good practice. Good amounts of recovery, steady progression and focused training which won&#39;t cause overreach. I think it would be considered a form conservative lactate threshold training from what I&#39;ve read. </p>

<p>I eye balled Jack Daniels (not literally) training philosophy, and what I&#39;m saying doesn&#39;t seem incoherent with what he&#39;s suggesting. I don&#39;t want to become obsessed with chart&#39;s or data either. </p>

<p>It seems logical to me to:</p>

<ol>
<li>Sense how long I can run for at a good pace with good running form</li>
<li>Do effortful intervals within that range</li>
<li>Have ample recovery time between </li>
<li>Do an easy long-ish run at the weekend</li>
</ol>

<p>Like I said, I think this type of program will work for me because I&#39;m a fairly big lad that needs to do intervals to prevent lower leg issues. Increasing the progression steadily is more likely to help prevent weeks off from over training.</p>

<div class="md"><p>I guess my problem is you say the plans are arbitrarily having you do workouts. 10k is a long distance race. You will need speed work but it is not the focus. Short intervals will give almost no benefit to your goal. Running often and for long periods will help more. </p>

<p>It&#39;s like me going over to <a href="/r/fitness">/r/fitness</a> and saying that I believe 5/3/1 doesn&#39;t work and instead I&#39;m going to create my own program based on my running background ignoring what all the experts say. I&#39;m going to do bench press at 20lbs and do reps for an hour because that is what I do for running and expecting to put on muscle.</p>

<p>I thought this was a section that might interested in a new approach to something. There are always tried and tested, and I don&#39;t think that essence of this is that new. I think it&#39;s basically a 80/20 program with a novel way of working out personalised  interval times to prevent injuries (that&#39;s basically what the 5 3 1 method does for weight lifting). I don&#39;t know what else to say to be honest. Is it not very clear for you?</p>

<div class="md"><p>If you&#39;re getting lower leg issues, size / weight regardless, then you need to build the muscles and movement patterns that support running directly.  <em>Contrary</em> to weight lifting, running uses very different regimes to accomplish this.  For instance, different race lengths require different training plans with different goals.  A short-distance sprinter will focus her/his training on fast-twitch muscle strength and anaerobic ability, whereas a 10K racer will need to lower their lactate threshold and will build that on top of a strong aerobic base, and a marathon runner will focus on high weekly mileage and an even stronger aerobic base with most of their miles barely tipping the needle on their heart rate zones (something a sprinter will do often).  Weight lifting programs all have the same general goal; lift heavier weights more times and more often, and vary in how to get to this goal.  Running programs vary in their goal, and training is tailored to develop the systems that support this goal.</p>

<p>A run-walk program, maybe like Couch To 5K or another established base building program, is exactly what you <em>should</em> be doing, not building your own homebrew that&#39;s based in the science for an entirely different discipline.  That&#39;s like trying to become a slalom skier by following training plans designed for basketball.  You might get results, you might get nothing, or you might get injured.  Once you&#39;ve built a base of running consistently with one of these plans, pick up a 10K specific plan.  Having done one of these 10K plans recently, the workouts for that distance are <em>very</em> different than simply &quot;run at goal pace for X minutes Y times.&quot;</p>

<p>Don&#39;t try and re-invent the wheel here friend; your situation of being &quot;a fairly big lad&quot; is not at all new to running philosophy &amp; training regimes, so find a plan that&#39;s been established <em>with running-specific results</em> and go with that.</p>

<div class="md"><p>That&#39;s a great message. But still think the underlying principles would work for me. </p>

<p>The quality of the 5 3 1 is working within tolerances but progressing over time. That to me is the essence of what I am doing. </p>

<p>I&#39;ve found a flat piece of ground and I can tailor my pace and judge my recovery in the moment. The 4min/km might be a tad fast, but it felt good to me, especially running that 15 times at an average of 45 seconds @ 4min/km with 2 minute recovery in-between. On paper that looks like a successful interval session for me.</p>

<p>And over a period of time I can increase the amount of time I can maintain that speed for while still having great running form (which is the key barometer). It&#39;s not like saying do 800m at this pace, do 400m at this pace. That doesn&#39;t sound very sensible to me in an era of GPS watches. I&#39;d prefer to judge myself when my running form goes a bit off, and build my running form strength over time.   </p>

<p>A lot of people read my first message and forget that I&#39;m talking about the a goal in about 2/3 years to run a 10K at that pace. I apologise if this came across like a 10K protocol, it&#39;s not, but I think the 10K pace I set myself was a happy accident for the design of the intervals. </p>

<p>I have been running three times a week for the last 2 months building myself up to do something a bit more proper. But I also want to do something which limits the potential for me to over-reach. And that&#39;s what the 5 3 1 method is great for. And there&#39;s no real science behind 5 3 1, the fella that developed it did so over time.</p>

<p>Maybe it&#39;s because I&#39;ve not invested in a running program, but I can&#39;t see why what I&#39;m proposing is not sensible. I&#39;m blending different kinds of systems, I&#39;m progressively building up my running fitness and doing intervals in a safe way. </p>

<p>I see a lot positives to it, such as body mindedness, sensing improvements, doing something fun, working towards injury prevention.</p>

<p>The distances <em>are</em> arbitrary, the paces these distances are performed at are <em>very much</em> <strong>NOT</strong> arbitrary though.</p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>Yeah, it&#39;s absolutely that.  Read Jack Daniels&#39; or Pete Pfitzinger&#39;s training philosophies, not just eyeball a training plan or two.  Both coaches are very similar in their philosophy, and have scientifically-backed and performance-backed rationale for each of their styles.  In their experience, running performance basically comes down to V02 max, lactate threshold, and running economy / aerobic base, plus some other bits here and there, but those are the main systems.  When you run intervals, your goal is to stress a specific running system, but in order to make performance gains while also minimizing the days of recovery you&#39;ll need, you should be running in specific paces / heart rate zones that are done for specific distances / times.  It&#39;s not a matter of &quot;running until I feel recovered / feel my form break down,&quot; because sometimes you <em>want</em> to be doing intervals that tap into specific running systems where you don&#39;t feel comfortable.</p>

<p>The &quot;method / plan&quot; you&#39;ve outlined here might get you to your goal time, but it&#39;s a very loose, flailing concept that you&#39;ve described.  Did I run a 40&#39; 10K without a plan?  Yeah, I did and I had no idea what I was doing, but I did it, and I&#39;m hoping you&#39;ll hit your goal too.  Did I also later read up on training philosophies, find a 10K specific training plan and adjust it to my needs, and then knock out a huge PR?  Also yes, 34:39, and while that was arguably more difficult, my body was significantly more ready for the task and I can actually pinpoint what helped in my training and what I could&#39;ve adjusted.  You&#39;re on here trying to justify your 5 3 1 plan, and commenters here are trying to explain why it&#39;s missing a <em>lot</em> of knowledge about running plans &amp; training, but you seem content to go on defending it.  I hope it works out, but realize that you&#39;re just not demonstrating that you understand how <em>running</em> training works, thus why many of us are questioning your plan and suggesting alternatives.  Alternatives that already consider body mindedness, sensing improvements, doing something fun, and working towards injury prevention, while also teaching you what works and <em>why</em> it works.</p>

<div class="md"><p>Thanks for your input, and another uptick as ever! </p>

<p>I&#39;ll hold my hands up, I am invested in this idea and I think in the short term it&#39;ll be great. Doing varied intervals mid-week and then my longer run at the weekend will be good training. </p>

<p>I&#39;m gonna give my training plan a go all the same, and I&#39;d argue that it&#39;s not as loose as you think. I&#39;ve considered the parameters that go into interval training and controlled them. I&#39;ve made clear how I&#39;ve worked out the intervals which is based on generally accepted advice that running form is very important. I can look at my heart rate and speed data after and see what sort of zones I&#39;m working etc and put quality sessions in that are achievable for me. If that means dialling back the number of repeats or reducing the duration of the interval then so be it, and I can progress from that point there after. I don&#39;t think that I need to destroy myself with every focused training, quite the opposite. But I do believe training should be focused and thought through. Then I&#39;ll be able to make a better judge of what change and develop next time, and see what works for me. </p>

<p>At some point I might find that actually I need to have two separate intervals like one for shorter and faster and, another for longer and slower. Either way I&#39;ll still work out my version of a 1rm at that pace i.e. how long I can hold that pace for without my form dropping, and then take off 10% for the reps.</p>

<p>I&#39;m speaking as someone that is interested in steady, injury free progress. I don&#39;t want to run myself in the ground with really hard sessions and spend time off with injuries. Running with bad form when getting back into running is a big no no in my book. The quality of the session has to be around the maintenance of good technique while progressively overloading. I don&#39;t think the two are mutually exclusive.</p>

<div class="md"><p>When I looked at different protocols approaches I felt that they were very arbitrary. There&#39;s a lot of info about the importance of running form and also gradually easing into running. </p>

<p>As someone that has picked up injuries in sports, and done over training in the past, I wanted an approach that was gradual and had biofeedback built into it. </p>

<p>the 5 3 1 method worked really well because it was a process that blended different characteristics of training load but also worked within safe limits. I don&#39;t see why this can&#39;t be applied to running. I think you&#39;ll find that blending training load and working within limits is the bread and butter of good sustainable coaching for endurance and strength. I suppose I&#39;ve taken a good idea from a different area and looking to apply it to a different discipline. </p>

<div class="md"><p>5 3 1 is a powerlifting protocol, built to maximize performance doing just one movement with max intensity.</p>

The only area where both kind of intersect are the short sprinting distances, but you&#39;re talking about 10K, for which you need to develop aerobic endurance, not just an ability to pull short all-out effort.</p>

<p>For running, bread and butter is getting lots of easy distance in, if you say that you can&#39;t run 10K non-stop, it&#39;s a sign that you should focus on being able to run it first, without even thinking about doing it at 4min pace.</p>

<p>So if you want to try and translate 5 3 1 to running without injuring yourself, you could think of changing your definition of 1RM from &quot;amount of time spent on given speed&quot; to something like &quot;amount of time/distance you can run non-stop with a certain low heart rate&quot; and work from there.</p>

<p>Or better read Jack Daniels like suggested above, or 80/20 running - it describes quite comprehensive approach that can be applied pretty much to everyone.</p>

<div class="md"><p>The problem I&#39;ve got with your definition of of a 1 rep max for running is that I could actually run quite a long way if I tried. But I know that I wouldn&#39;t be able to get out of bed the morning after. </p>

<p>My version of a 1RM I think is better because once my running form begins to dip I&#39;m well within the point where I&#39;ll cause myself an injury. By doing intervals that are 65, 75 and 85 % of that is sensible training because it&#39;s within my tolerance, gets plenty of heavy breathing going, but will be progress at a safe rate over time. I don&#39;t see how my approach will cause an injury when I&#39;m purposefully working within my limits. </p>

<p>A friend of mine also doing a PhD but in exercise science had a specialism in football. His research was looking at the implications of extra time and developing training approaches to support footballers that go beyond 90 minutes. We talked a bit about training and interval training. He was sure that doing intervals were the way forward for both anaerobic and aerobic if you were limited for time (like most of us are). At the weekend I&#39;ll go for a run walk with my girlfriend nice and easy. But the midweek around that will be this conservative interval training. </p>

<p>I think it&#39;ll probably work out to 80/20 running. At least doing it this way will mean that the intervals are tailored to my running fitness and not an arbitrary number, or something which I optimistically aspire to (to my cost).</p>

<div class="md"><p>I love the enthusiasm and all the research. But, your workouts are more speed focus than distance. They&#39;re different fields. It&#39;s like taking a powerlifter and making him compete in crossfit. He can squat 600 but I doubt he can do 10x225 after 15x pull ups and 30x burpees for 3 circuits. </p>

<p>The saying &quot;Everyone can run fast but not everyone can run long&quot; rings true. You need to build up your aerobic base so you can handle all the anaerobic training you throw at it. 7 mins of fast running is not going to produce the same results as 30 minutes of slow running.</p>

<div class="md"><p>Thanks!</p>

<p>Yeah you&#39;re right, I&#39;m doing a speed orientated session, but over time the duration running at that speed increases. So week on week the interval durations increase at safe amounts which mean I&#39;d maintain solid running form and lower the chances of injury. I&#39;m starting small but focused, and will look to progressively increase the interval duration over time.</p>

<div class="md"><p>I think for this too work I need to have a 1 rep max equivalent. So to do that I need to have a constant somewhere which is the race pace. The point that I feel my form breaking represents the weight being too much. So when I run my intervals I&#39;ll try to stick to that 4 min/km for a set period of time, rather than an arbitrary distance.</p>

<p>I am starting off as a beginner here in terms of my running fitness, so 4min/km is actually pretty fast for me, and I can only keep it up in earnest for a minute. But I think that pace just happens to be right for me and the exercise.</p>

<div class="md"><p>Good question. I&#39;ve looked at my spreadsheet and my recovery is time is an arbitrary 2 mins. So that&#39;s about 70% of the time you could consider easy miles. I included a 10km very easy run walk at the weekend that would probably increase to 90% or more easy miles?</p>

<p>It might also change depending on how much recovery I feel I need between intervals. But hopefully because of the gradual nature of the protocol I can keep that recovery period fairly stationary (ideally).</p>

<p>I remember with the weight lifting the key thing was not to do too much extra, so if I do do easy miles I&#39;ll be doing them at a low intensity</p>

<p>&#x200B;</p>

<p>edit* I think one of the assumptions I&#39;m working with is ensuring I run with good form. So I&#39;ll judge the recovery time and what I do in the recovery time by how well I feel I can maintain solid running form.</p>
