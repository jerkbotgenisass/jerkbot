<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Hey All,
   I&#39;m looking for suggestions on what can be done in a healthy way to put on weight. Ive always been a skinny dude (60ish kg), i can basically eat large amounts of food for months on end and never put on weight, it actually sucks. i went <em>mostly</em> paleo for digestive issues a few years back (cant do beans,legumes, grains, dairy etc). and i do like my energy levels and mental health more since eating well. Anyway i dont exercise heaps (Pilates 2 times a week and maybe 1x  8k hike). 
anyway below is one day of eating habits for example-</p>

<p>breakfast 9am - chopped kale, celery, apple, lemon, Carrot, goji berries, protein powder, cricket powder, collagen, avo, olive oil.
decaf coffee +coconut milk</p>

<p>lunch 1pm ish - root vegetables and protein (chicken or fish or cow or pig or roo) </p>

<p>dinner 7 pm ish - slaw &amp; broccolini (coconut oil) + collagen, salmon, gf garlic bread.</p>

<p>im actually mostly still hungry after dinner most nights unless i have a large steak and lots of sweet potato.</p>

<p>snacks - yesterday was kale chips and some frozen roasted sweet potato, seaweed, protein bar (paleo one).</p>

<p>i went on a holiday recently and are processed shit food for 11 days as i was living out of a campvan with no fridges (was at a festival) and didn&#39;t put on any weight. no Matter how much i eat i cant put on weight (even if i eat stupid high amount of food past the &quot;im full point&quot; which i tried once.). i want to do fasting sometimes for health benefits but cant because of my weight is too low.</p>

<p>TLDR - what can i do to put on weight while also being healthy?</p>

<div class="md"><p>If I were in you shoes I would start by downloading a calorie counting app like my fitness pal and meticulously counting how many calories I was eating for 2 weeks. It&#39;s a really big pain in the neck but totally worth it in the end. By meticulous I mean food scale level meticulous.</p>

<p>The second thing I would do was input my stats into an online TDEE calculator and figure out what my maintenance calories were.</p>

<p>Thirdly, if you find out by tracking calories that you are actually eating far more than your maintenance calories you need to see a doctor to figure out if there&#39;s a physiological reason that you cannot gain weight. Several diseases exhibit this symptom.</p>

<p>If after tracking calories you find that you are eating at maintenance or below you will be able to increase your calorie intake as needed. </p>

<p>I would start by getting the proper data so that you can make an informed decision about what to do next. You can&#39;t really decide if you should start lifting weights, or if you are eating enough, or if you are eating the right foods without this crucial piece of data.</p>

<div class="md"><p>That’s what I would suggest. </p>

<p>OP, If you gain weight from food it just means you’re getting fatter. Do some weight lifting to increase your muscle mass.</p>

<p>Stop doing these. You want to put on weight? Eat calorie dense foods and weight train consistently. Beef, potatoes, olive oil, guacamole, paleo wraps, blue berries, bananas.</p>
