<div class="md"><blockquote>
<p>I&#39;ve been with my wife for about 12 years. Married for 5. Have kids age 3 and 1, and expecting another baby in the fall.  </p>

<p>Based on how many young kids we have it may seem like we have a good sex life, but it&#39;s not true. Before having any kids we had sex at least weekly with her initiating at least half the time. After having the first kid it all changed. Since that kid was born 3.5 years ago, we&#39;ve probably had sex a total of dozen times, all with me initiating and her rejecting about 95% of my attempts.  </p>

<p>She&#39;s a stay at home mom and I&#39;m the income earner. This agreement was reached mutually. I make plenty of money for her and the kids to basically get whatever they need. I help with the kids as much as I can and watch them on the weekend while she gets alone time.  </p>

<p>I&#39;m just wondering if my expectations are unreasonable given the situation. I understand raising two young kids and being pregnant is a lot of work. But I&#39;d still expect to have sex maybe once a week and her to show some interest in me. She hasn&#39;t initiated sex in 4 years. I feel lonely and undesired. Is this something that will naturally pass once the kids are all a bit older?  </p>

<p>Last year I started lifting weights and getting in shape thinking that would help. I have pretty good lifts now but hasn&#39;t changed a thing in our relationship.</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Post ass</p></li>
<li><p>Delete account</p></li>
<li><p>Fuck off</p></li>

<p>But for you, I have a different recommendation. </p>

<ol>
<li><p>Actually lift weights and stop being so pathetically weak</p></li>
<li><p>Be a less shitty person, either for the sake of inherent goodness, or in hopes that perhaps someone will find you attractive enough to have sex with and you won&#39;t have to be a rule34 incel anymore</p></li>
<li><p>Fuck off</p></li>
