<p>I hope someone is paying you for that, because at that rate it sounds like a job to me.</p>

<div class="md"><p>Firstly, measure yourself as well as taking pictures! (yeah that&#39;s right, get nekid, take pictures....they are only for your eyes any way!! and take as many angles as possible!)</p>

<p>If you are training 6 times a day and weight training, your &#39;plateau&#39; maybe down to added muscle. Your initial loss may have been water loss, then you have added some muscle size (you might not be bulky as you&#39;re not in calorific surplus, however, the calories you&#39;re consuming and the workouts you are doing could be the reason due to added muscle (you maybe overtraining).</p>

<p>Overtraining and inadequate rest, could also be another reason, you&#39;re not allowing sufficient time for your body to adapt - your weight loss should mostly come from diet and then exercise should be secondary.</p>

<div class="md"><p>I’m not sure what calculator you used but it looks like your fat is too low your protein is too high and your calories are too low. I’m 205 and I eat 2100 when I’m cutting alone with protein and fat about equal in term of grams.</p>

<div class="md"><p>What food are you actually eating?  Try getting some plastic body fat calipers or try one of those body fat machines at the supplement stores, see if you are building muscle that&#39;s making you weigh more?</p>

<div class="md"><p>Scale weight is an extremely poor barometer of body composition, have you taken measurements, progressing with weight in the gym?</p>

<div class="md"><p>Those macros you have written are completely jacked up. I’m male 5’9 157lbs and if I use ketogains macros with a sedentary lifestyle I’d be having around 1600 calories. (I don’t live sedentary lifestyle, just using it as a reference point) I don’t think you used the calculator or perhaps just didn’t use it correctly. You are definitely under eating, if you lost 50lbs you’d have no more calories to cut out. In my opinion you’re also overtraining. </p>

<p>If you are working out that much, and that is your weight, you should be getting in 2k+ calories, around 150g protein 20g carbs and 170g fat to lose weight.</p>
