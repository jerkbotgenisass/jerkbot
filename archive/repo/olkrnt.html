<div class="md"><p>Lol, doctors know as much about bodybuilding, steroids, and what&#39;s natty or not, as any random off the street who isn&#39;t into the culture. </p>

<p>Most doctors I know have 0 knowledge about training, supplements, steroids, rehab, prehab, injuries and injury risk, nutrition, etc. </p>

<p>They can look in the back of your throat and figure out if you have mono or strep, but anything beyond baseline health is beyond them.</p>

<div class="md"><p>Truuuue. I (M, 30, UK) went to my GP and asked about  blood work as I was worried my shit was off kilter (here you’ve gotta blag you can’t get hard to get them done) I spoke about test levels, free test, LH, shbg etc... and he looked at me like I was talking another language and this mu fu googled, like literally googled on his pc in front of me.</p>

<div class="md"><p>Yup. Just done the same. I&#39;m not on anything but I just want to see where my T levels are at and I&#39;ve got to try and blag all the symptoms of low T to try and get it done.

<div class="md"><p>Yeah you gotta lay it on real thick tbh. If you do get through, ask for details too. When I called to to inquire about results all I was told (by a fucking receptionist) was in normal ranges and no further action. She then told me she couldn’t give me specifics. 
Like ‘normal ranges’ could still be at the real low end... and I was experiencing low mood, energy and libido, junk was hard but with work and family dramas too the enthusiasm to use it for anything other than pissing was low... fast forward 3-4years I’ve done a few courses, in good shape and state of mind I’m cruising on 200mg cyp a week (ugl) and feel great, good sense of self and wellbeing, energy and with a healthy drive and pretty much everything how it should be.</p>

<div class="md"><p>Provider here, I&#39;d say this statement is somewhat true. Keep in mind that many people becoming Healthcare providers have alot of intersecting interests with nutrition/PT/fitness interests. On average, students becoming providers are definitely more fit on average than your normal grad student. But also there are plenty that have no interest and aren&#39;t too healthy, which is obviously ridiculous since they know how it effects their health.</p>

<div class="md"><p>My point is, your typical orthopedic m ig ht not know shit about common ortho issues related to sports if their practice is just regular population. Even if they are an ortho, they know what they do regularly.</p>

<p>And fucking context bro, none of those people in her operating room we de endocrinologists. So expecting them to suspect steroid use is not likely to be validated. And even if they were and endocrinologist, my point is they would know symptoms of menopause, thyroid issues, etc, they prolly still wouldn&#39;t know what gear use in a female athlete looks like.</p>

<p>they can more than likely explain in detail the pharmacokinetics and dynamics of steroids. you don’t think they know that a woman shouldn’t have that level of musculature without a significant myostatin disorder?</p>

<div class="md"><p>Dude you serious? Most endocrinologists specialize in treating diabetes. This isn’t hate this is reality. The performance aspect of endocrinology relating to the effects of testosterone and other downstream effects are not widely used in their area. It’s not widespread knowledge that every endocrinologists have. You can’t expect a diabetes doctor to tell you how dianabol works in your body because he doesn’t know. This shit is not widespread knowledge. Just because someone has a degree doesn’t mean they know what their talking about. Some do, most don’t.</p>

<div class="md"><p>Ya dbol isn’t in the curriculum lol. What is at a minimum is a couple 100 pages where we are responsible to know every complex detail of endocrine systems for our board examinations. Every word printed. Does everyone even keep that knowledge? Hell no. </p>

<p>Our curriculum exposure to anabolics is the pattern of hypogonadism they cause, the obvious side effects they cause, and a psychiatrists history of someone with test psychosis(probs tren lol). </p>

<p>Just by watching Derek y’all will know more about anabolics/PEDs than 99% of physicians. Probably 99.9%. </p>

<p>But endocrinology is much more vast. It is incomprehensible to someone who has not lived it, the volume of material. And true the field of endocrinology has become more diabetes focused.. idk what the % is but I bet it’s the majority of patient volume for many endos.</p>

<p>And since it&#39;s illegal since the 1990&#39;s there is no incentive to specialize in steroid use. </p>

<div class="md"><p>But thats exactly i think is the problem we need to start being more open about this stuff so young kids and people who don&#39;t work out can be a little more educated on what can really be achieved naturally and what can be achieved on gear. To me that fear can be taking away by education. Because most people think you just take it and then you&#39;ll just magically wake up like a swole god. But it still requires hours at the gym and hardwork. Plus this girl was 23 man i read an article about and just like i thought it was a shit clinic where the person who applied the anasthesia didn&#39;t know what they were doing. This might actually be the clinics fault because the one article i read claimed they didn&#39;t know about her PED use so they probably didn&#39;t even ask her questions.</p>

<div class="md"><p>But they will quickly find out it doesn’t work. It happens all the time these days, and it’s why there’s such a huge movement to educate. Part of that is about being open. </p>

<p>I actively tell everyone I trust to make sure they know what I’m about. They see my work and they know it isn’t just drugs. I teach them basics about endocrinology, even for natties, and why they shouldn’t necessarily touch drugs (but that they may want to at some point and it isn’t always a bad thing either). </p>

<p>That’s education. Not hiding in fear of the public perception. You have to risk your own life to save the lives of others in this way, but it’s worth changing the perception towards PEDs.</p>

<div class="md"><p>Yes i understand that there are reasons to not say your on gear but i believe we as a society need to start accepting and being more mindful of PED&#39;s because we can benefit from it as in more research and development into enchanced drugs and start developing these enhancements without the side effects. Idk i think our health could benefit from it and we can issue this stuff more safely obviously it would effect healthcare plans but still i would rather have that knowing people who are using it are getting monitored and not abusing it especially young people. And no i don&#39;t think younger kids would stop working out because they would have the knowledge of understanding what they are taking and the pros and cons of this stuff.

<div class="md"><p>BULL SHIT!!!</p>

<p>I’m in healthcare and have worked in the OR along side anesthesiologist and their assortment of Rx’s. I can’t think of any PED someone would be on that would kill them under general anesthesia. </p>

<p>People come into the OR all the time unable to explain what meds they are on, and anesthesiologist can work around the changes in physiological parameters caused by unknown substances. Car crash victims coming in unconscious but drunk as hell and having been on a meth binge for three days, anesthesiologist can handle that. So what PED would kill you when having general anesthesia? It’s called a shitty anesthesiologist that killed her, not some PED. </p>

<p>When people do die it’s due to CNS depression. You know if a PED that depresses your CNS, neither do I. Maybe beta blockers if you get nervous when playing golf. That’s no bull shit.</p>

<div class="md"><p>[β2-Agonists: terbutaline, salbutamol, and clenbuterol  β2-Agonists are well-known therapeutic agents used primarily for their bronchodilating effect. Some β2-agonists such as clenbuterol and fenoterol have additional anabolic effects thought to be mediated via β2-receptors, although the exact mechanism is unclear. There is some evidence that long-term high-dose oral salbutamol can also improve muscle strength and endurance performance.6 Owing to these perceived benefits, abuse is common and all β2-agonists are banned by the World Anti-Doping Agency with the exception of inhaled salbutamol and salmeterol when used for therapeutic purposes.  </p>

<p>Anaesthetic considerations  Side-effects of β2-agonists are well documented and include tachyarrhythmias, prolonged QT, hypokalaemia, and lactic acidosis. Toxicity is usually associated with acute ingestion and should be treated with appropriate i.v. fluids, β-blockers, potassium supplementation, and bicarbonate before induction of anaesthesia.7 The long-term consequences of abuse are unknown.  ](<a href="https://academic.oup.com/bjaed/article/16/7/247/2196387">https://academic.oup.com/bjaed/article/16/7/247/2196387</a>)</p>

<p>Anyone with half a gram of grey matter can see that’s a blatant lie, you don’t get to look like this, FEMALE and claim natty, nope</p>
