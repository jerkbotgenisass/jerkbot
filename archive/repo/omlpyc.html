<div class="md"><p>Good luck with that bro.
I don’t think those dosages are ‘bad’ as one-offs (though they can strain the heart etc), but it is definitely reckless to build a tolerance to those doses and thereby ruining the simple pleasures of a cup of coffee or soda, and needing a pretty uncomfortable abstinence to regain sensitivity.</p>

<div class="md"><p>I&#39;m unsure the raw degree each diverges on such an important factor, I just find is very notable that they&#39;re opposite since people typically associate coffee with caffeine, although it&#39;s really a whole blend of various chemicals working in harmony. I&#39;m absolutely immune to energy drinks and yet 4oz coffee is very stimulating.</p>

<div class="md"><p>Yeah it’s pretty wild how different caffeine sources affect me too. I get nothing from coffee, slight stimulation from certain teas, but great stimulation physically and mentally with sugar free monsters. I’m convinced it’s the taurine, but just guessing.</p>

<div class="md"><p>Is it like with extracts I&#39;d some things with a lot of alkaloids tend to be &quot;bad&quot; -- so to the lack of supporting alkaloids? Things like kava extract, etc,  - just an example...</p>

<p>So many things have synergistic effects within them, like coffee and black tea or matcha green tea, so extracting just one thing, like just the caffeine in this case, would make it not as good, it would be flat, not balanced, nothing special or superior.</p>

<p>Okay, think of it like coffee is a rainbow, and caffeine is the color green. You can&#39;t say green is the only way a rainbow is beautiful. It&#39;s the full spectrum of a rainbow, all colors combined in that unique way, that we enjoy. But green can be a nice color. But a rainbow just is special. You can&#39;t have a rainbow that&#39;s just green.</p>

<div class="md"><p>Yeah both caffeine and adderall make me calm/tired. Caffeine is easier to control imo, and gives more desirable effects. Adderall always made me too tired to do anything, but too awake to sleep, so I stopped using it about 8 years ago. Caffeine is not the only thing I use to control it, but it’s the most common I use. If you really have trouble focusing, are disorganized, forgetful, and always doing a million different tasks, I’d definitely ask your doctor about a possible ADHD diagnosis.</p>

<div class="md"><p>I used to get tired on caffeine, esp when younger. I was diagnosed ADD as a child, adult ADHD as an adult.</p>

<p>Weirdly, after stopping ADHD meds and doing CBT therapy for it, caffeine stopped making me tired! It can totally energize me and give me lift and endurance like it&#39;s supposed to. So I think you&#39;re not screwed for life to have ADHD or to be react to a substance always the same way. Which is a good thing, bc I always hated having ADHD!!!

<div class="md"><p>I agree that it&#39;s likely not very harmful but a.) the fact is that you&#39;re dependent on something and there&#39;s nothing good about that, and b.) what happens when you don&#39;t get the caffeine? My advice is break that cycle up, even if it&#39;s just every now and then. One day when you can be &quot;down&quot; just don&#39;t take any and see what happens. Hopefully no ill effects but it&#39;s worth investigating. I just have an obsession with not being dependent on substances.</p>
