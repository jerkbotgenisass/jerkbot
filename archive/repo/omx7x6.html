Is fight training really just mental endurance?

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>This might be a dumb question, but how does fight training... well, work? </p>

<p>The guys all do &quot;power&quot; stuff like power jerks, rotational med ball throws, etc. They also all distance run. I mean, I&#39;m assuming. I just watched Rocky and was told that every boxer&#39;s life story is essentially identical to it. But in all seriousness, they both recognize both power and endurance as equally important to their sport.</p>

<p>Blood vessel architecture adaptions, mitochondrial density, and all of that whole can of worms is anathematic to power training, obviously. So... what&#39;s the deal? How do the power cleans not make their muscles less endurance-capable while the distance running makes their muscles less power-capable? </p>

<p>If we&#39;re biasing things in favor of one mode of training over another so that they don&#39;t cancel each other out, then why is the other mode not depressing the magnitude of the effects generated by the preferred mode?</p>

<div class="md"><p>There is absolutely evidence that distance running nudges muscles cells towards the oxidative side of the muscle fiber spectrum through various mechanisms. There absolutely is evidence in the literature that endurance training interferes with power adaptations &#39;in practice&#39;. The boys have discussed this directly on the pod. Your article (which I&#39;ve seen before) is about powerlifting. I&#39;m asking about performance in tasks that involve force production at higher velocities.</p>

<p>With all due respect, the whole &quot;don&#39;t ask about any micro-level thing, just follow advice&quot; schtick has been done to death on this website. If you aren&#39;t curious, you are welcome not to engage in what you feel is unhelpful &quot;speculation about mechanisms&quot; or whatever. But logging in and trying to convince other people that they&#39;re wasting their time trying to learn about them is... not a good use of your time. Just a lil friendly advice.</p>

<p>Look again--it never says this. Also, seriously--no need to try and dunk on me. We&#39;re all on the rainbow path towards truth and justice here. Take a rip of some extract</p>

<p>I double checked to be sure. The letters &quot;p-o-w-e-r&quot; appear seven times in succession on the webpage. Most are &#39;powerlifting&#39;, and the other is a discussion of aerobic power in the setting of glycolytic and aerobic cycling sprints. The question was about fighting, specifically boxing, which is a unique physical task that combines endurance with the frequent need to reactively carry out powerful single-stroke muscle contractions using just whatever ATP+CP happens to be on hand at the instant the opportunity to strike arises. (Obviously it&#39;s not THAT simple, all energy systems are active to some extent at all times, but I think you see what I&#39;m saying), but its a different kind of &#39;power&#39; than that which is measured in sprints on a cycle) The article never claims, as you have said, that the effect on power is greatly overexaggerated.</p>

<p>Yes--this is part of the evidence I was referring to! It supports my position.</p>

<p>IDK man maybe that&#39;s true to a modest extent, but I&#39;m going to have to start seriously questioning my sanity if improving my lower body power didn&#39;t carry over to improved punching power. There&#39;s so much power in those few inches of flexion that develops in lockstep with the fundamental hip extension movements</p>

<div class="md"><p>Greg is mainly referring to strength and hypertrophy in the article, yeah, but if you look at figures 3 and 4 in the meta power follows a similar dose response to them. The percent decrease is worse, but not insanely so. If the cycling vs. running distinction holds true for power, as well, the effect may be negligible with the right choice of endurance exercise. In the context of your original post, which makes it sound like the adaptations completely cancel out, I don&#39;t think you&#39;re exactly being supported by this. </p>

<p>If you&#39;re going to argue that boxing-power and the power measurements used in research are different, I don&#39;t think you&#39;ll ever get a conclusive, satisfactory answer.     However, I think that meta does a good job of showing why an athlete who requires both endurance and power would do concurrent training - the net benefits vastly outweigh sticking to a single training modality, especially if the endurance training bouts are kept reasonable. The only thing this article suggests might be wrong about their training is the amount of distance running some boxers do (IIRC Mayweather ran a ton, and that might not be beneficial for the average fighter)</p>

<p>And yeah, that&#39;s why I said it would matter less for a boxer then for an athlete who could throw kicks. Never said it wouldn&#39;t matter at all, but you aren&#39;t relying on leg power as much</p>

<p>I don&#39;t know what you mean by this sentence, but I don&#39;t think there&#39;s much of a distinction. I think there&#39;s a distinction between endurance running/cycling and sprint running/cycling.</p>

<p>The researchers would not agree with you that the cycling sprints would predict performance in power activities like punching. A better approximation would be the power jerk, or even something like SVJ would be more overall predictive of a persons ability to &quot;pull the trigger&quot; and recruit all the motor units for one contraction.</p>

<div class="md"><p>Read the paper I linked. They discuss how cycling did not appear to affect strength and hypertrophy like running did and propose that it&#39;s related to other effects. Greg also discusses it in the original article I linked.</p>

<p>I&#39;m not saying they&#39;re identical, just that you&#39;ll likely never get a conclusive answer if you want to require power jerks. Running studies takes a lot of effort, and teaching college kids to Olympic lift isn&#39;t trivial. <strong>However</strong>, if you&#39;re happy with vertical jumps, they did use some of those measurements in some of the included studies - not every included one was a Wingate test.

<p>Seen it! It is a discussion of strength outcomes. The old &quot;strength is specific&quot; meme that was going around a few years ago is super relevant here--high velocity strength, commonly referred to as &#39;power&#39; in S&amp;C discussions--is not nearly as dependent on strength as you say, my fiend! Moreover, the type of power expression measured in a wingate is different than that measured in a power jerk. One wouldn&#39;t expect a particularly tight relationship between punching power and performance on a wingate. I wouldn&#39;t want power jerks measured because it would be much easier to simply measure punch PSI lol. I was just giving an example of a few tests that would be more specific than wingates</p>

<div class="md"><p>I&#39;m telling you that you should read it again or the meta itself if you don&#39;t understand what I mean when I refer to the interference effect for strength/hypertrophy being greater with running than cycling. It&#39;s covered both in the paper and discussed by Greg in the article, which I mentioned because it&#39;s very brief and you seem to insist on arguing over a paper you haven&#39;t read yet. They didn&#39;t have enough data to see if power was also unaffected by cycling, but given the strong correlation between strength, hypertrophy, and power outcomes I wouldn&#39;t be surprised if that was the case.</p>

<p>How often is punch PSI measured in research, though? A quick search suggests it&#39;s not a super common measurement, and the closest thing I found was this paper correlating strength and power: <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26110348/">https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26110348/</a> (didn&#39;t see any training interventions or anything of more value to the discussion)</p>

<div class="md"><p>Boxing is incredibly skill and technique dependent.  Its the most important thing and the most training resources are generally spend upon those elements. </p>

<p>Everything else is just building upon the ability to maintain that technical proficiency ideally throughout the entire bout or until a stoppage happens.  </p>

<p>The strength,  power and endurance areas are very dependent on the specific fighter, his or her style and strengths and weaknesses.  There isn&#39;t one way boxers train.  There&#39;s a lot of different ways that have been implemented by different high level fighters over the years.</p>

<div class="md"><p>Depends on the fighting style of the individual and rule set, if you have 5 five-minute bouts vs three bouts or 3 three-minute bouts, or no time limit submission only.  Fighters need to train their power (if that&#39;s how they fight), need to make their body anti-fragile with proper strength training and tend to the areas they could improve on.  A defensive fighter who wins on points won&#39;t need to focus as heavy on their absolute power development if that power is not being used in their game, but they may train their ability to perform repeat efforts such that they do not slow down throughout the match.</p>

<p>But the largest mistake that is often made by newbies is thinking that they need to focus on gym work over technical sport work, if you&#39;re already a very strong at the barbell lifts as a wrestler you might be better off spending more time grappling in weak positions because driving up your squat isn&#39;t going to help you.  Essentially you need an objective view of what you should be doing relative to your curent skills, is it getting stronger going to help you or will adding mass be meaningful or is it technical/situational work for your sport required?</p>

<div class="md"><p>They&#39;re not putting 100% effort into improving everything all at once. </p>

<p>If they need more technical work, they put more effort into classes and less into lifting weights/conditioning if it&#39;s interfering with their skill development. </p>

<p>If they&#39;re losing fights because they&#39;re not strong enough, they wait until the off season and start hitting the weights harder. As they get closer to fight season they move the lifting closer to maintenance and drill more technical work. </p>

<p>They periodize their goals. Focus on improving some stuff. Pull it back and just focus on retaining what they have built when they need to push another aspect.</p>

<div class="md"><p>Did you read the bit in the OP about fiber type conversion? I&#39;m not asking if they can improve both simultaneously. I&#39;m asking how improvements in one don&#39;t erase improvements in the other to some extent. </p>

<p>Cardiovascular endurance and the mental grit required to push through in fatigued states are traits that we can gain from distance running. If that were as far as it went, there&#39;d be no contradiction. But distance running will also bring about skeletal muscular adaptation at the cellular level--precisely of the sort that we&#39;d want to minimize if we want to punch hard.</p>

<div class="md"><p>Sure thing. I&#39;m not sure that everybody completely understood the question you were asking. Being involved in combat sports myself and training with MMA fighters, I would note that boxing might not be as power-dependent as it seems. Lots of random people can knock somebody out, as evidenced by any number of fight videos on the internet. What really separates elite boxers from your average guy imo is power endurance and aerobic capacity. </p>

<p>The ability to deliver a knockout punch several rounds into a fight and potentially dozens or hundreds of strikes into a fight is far more important than the ability to generate one powerful single-stroke muscular effort. Boxing involves power, but in a very different way from oly lifting or sprinting.</p>

<div class="md"><p>Yea power endurance is a good term for what I&#39;m talking about for sure. Point is well taken.</p>

<p>Still, though, you can&#39;t deny that every boxing coach who sees a welterweight-sized guy dunking a basketball can&#39;t help but salivate at the idea of getting him in the gym and weaponizing him hehe</p>

<div class="md"><p>Honest suggestion to read tactical barbell 2 (conditioning). Possibly also the first one, about strength training.</p>
