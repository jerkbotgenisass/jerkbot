<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p><strong>Goals</strong></p>

<p>I&#39;m about 3 weeks into keto (34M/5&#39;10&quot;, SW: 225 lbs, CW: 215 lbs) and am proud of myself for being completely compliant (with an asterisk, I&#39;ll come back to this). I never got the keto flu, have had a couple of tired/exhausted days, but overall I would say my energy level is higher than it was on a high-carb diet. I lift weights 4 days/week (still within noob lift numbers) and run 2-3 days/week, which I need to start doing for longer distances for an upcoming team relay in September. I was quite surprised I was able to perform at the same intensity as pre-keto! That said, ultimately my goal is to lose fat. I&#39;ve gained about 60 lbs since 2016, may have put on a bit of muscle, but it&#39;s mostly fat. There&#39;s a NSFW photo from the back in my profile if you feel so inclined to see. My first goal is to get back down to about 190 and see how things look and feel from there.</p>

<p>I haven&#39;t noticed the sleep benefits yet because my sleep hygiene needs work, but am hopeful that the combined weight loss and better habits will reverse the sleep apnea I was diagnosed with a couple of years ago. </p>

<p><strong>Progress</strong></p>

<p>I&#39;m trying to stick to 20g/carbs/day since moderation is generally tough for me so even though 50g might be ok, I don&#39;t want to give myself too much wiggle room. That said, the scale has slowly moved down a bit and I&#39;m trying to plan for the next couple of months. I should be fully fat adapted between now and another week and I&#39;m really hoping within the next month is when I really start to see the fat come off, so long as I don&#39;t overeat regularly. I have gotten some cravings (last night was particularly bad) but haven&#39;t caved, instead overeating other foods like cheese or bacon or pepperoni sticks. Starting this week I would like to really dial into the calorie counting and make this work for me.</p>

<p><strong>Strategy</strong></p>

<p>Originally I only planned to do keto for 3-4 months, ideally sticking to my calorie limits and getting lean before Winter so I can do a proper controlled bulk and focus more on weightlifting. Depending how the next couple of months go, I may transition back to a paleo-style whole food diet but we&#39;ll see. </p>

<p>On my vacation next week I plan on sticking to my guns, only drinking whiskey/bourbon and sugar-free mixers if I drink at all, and being prepared with road snacks. We&#39;re staying in a cabin with a kitchen so I think overall it should be pretty easy to plan for. I want to start being more prepared and cooking more dishes instead of gravitating to the quick options. So far my diet has consisted largely of the staples: leafy greens and grilled zucchini, avocados, eggs (5-6/day), chicken, ground turkey, bacon, pork rinds, almonds, pepperoni sticks, and cheese. I recently found out Costco carries keto-friendly bagels so I picked some of those up and mixed in a scoop of strawberry whey protein into cream cheese for a nice spread.</p>

<p><strong>Hurdles</strong></p>

<p>Although I haven&#39;t outright cheated, I think I&#39;ve done a little &quot;dirty keto&quot; without realizing it and am now wondering how important that part really is. A friend bought me some spicy pork rinds and I noticed the ingredients included maltodextrin and dextrose. Shit. I&#39;ve also been drinking a lot of sugar-free sodas and Mio water flavorings, the former of which I&#39;ve read you should be careful with and try not to consume them. I also drink a TON of black coffee, so no issues there.</p>

<p>My only other &quot;cheats&quot; have been a couple of bunless burgers in a pinch with no ketchup or sauces, just mustard and pickles.</p>

<p>So I guess my main question is, how do you fight cravings when you&#39;re already near your calorie limit for the day, and what do you do when you&#39;re just not really wanting the things you have in your fridge? I love eggs but when I already eat so many for meals, a hard boiled egg as a snack just doesn&#39;t cut it. As I mentioned, moderation can be tough for me and &quot;if you can have x but don&#39;t want it, you&#39;re just bored eating and are not hungry&quot; is hard to get past. Just looking for some advice, I realize a lot of it comes down to having an unhealthy relationship with food and re-framing can be helpful.</p>

<p><strong>Tips and Tricks</strong></p>

<p>My one big win was finding keto-friendly bagels and making a strawberry spread using whey protein to get my bread fix. It&#39;s more a texture thing more than anything, so if you&#39;re missing that, it&#39;s worth trying. I guess I don&#39;t really have much more advice than what&#39;s already been said, having something prepared and readily available really helps with not being tempted by other things.</p>

<div class="md"><p>There‚Äôs nothing wrong with zero carb drinks, Mio drops, pork rinds with maltodextrin, or bunless burgers. They‚Äôre not ‚Äúcheats,‚Äù they‚Äôre not ‚Äúdirty,‚Äù it is all perfectly acceptable when eating a ketogenic diet if you can make it all for your macros. üëçüèª</p>

<p>Neither of there are even close to cheats! These are fine, bunless burgers are a great keto option.</p>

<p>For the cravings and hunger, try adding more fatty meat to your diet, I see a lot of lean meats there (which are fine) but if you are still hungry try something fattier like a steak.</p>

<p>This should satiate you more and can help you say no to snacking.</p>

<p>Also make sure you&#39;re getting enough salt, cravings could be your body asking for electrolytes!</p>

<p>Pickles are a great low cal snack with some sodium in there as well.</p>

<div class="md"><p>I wasn&#39;t sure about pickles since there&#39;s usually sugar in the brine, are pickles negligible enough in calories that you don&#39;t really need to track them? On other diet plans the consensus seems to be unless you&#39;re a bodybuilder with stupidly tight macros that leafy green veggies and broccoli aren&#39;t even accounted for.</p>

<div class="md"><p>A few things that work well for me for cravings when I don&#39;t want anymore calories:</p>

<p>Olives! I&#39;m not sure I even really like olives or not but their salty bitterness often turns me off from wanting to eat something else. </p>

<p>Pickle brine. Delicious, also nice and salty which I think helps with the satiety. Or even just the pickles, they only have like 10 calories. </p>

<p>Tea!! All I do is drink tea. I keep blueberry, peach, and lemon ginger tea stocked at all times. Gives you a full warm belly with literally no calories.</p>

<div class="md"><p>I never thought to go for the pickle brine, that&#39;s a great idea! I&#39;ll give that a shot :).</p>
