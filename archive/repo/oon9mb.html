<div class="md"><p>OP, you should just go back tomorrow as though nothing happened.  The longer you stay away, the worse it will get in your mind.<br/>
They probably don&#39;t even care, and if they laugh just say something witty back  like &quot;yeah, I guess I&#39;m not ready to do 70kg yet!&quot;, or whatever.
It&#39;s probably not as bad as you think</p>

<div class="md"><p>If you vomited, you would feel embarrassed, but not as bad.  It&#39;s the same thing, just the other end.  Chill.
Maybe call in advance to explain you had a bad stomach, if you&#39;re worried about being turned away.</p>
