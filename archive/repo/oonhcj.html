<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>How well do we need to chew meat?</p>

<p>I’m eating around 1.2kg meat a day, I can’t afford the ribeye, so I’m eating other cuts, which are tougher to eat.</p>

<p>Also I’m fed up of spending so long to eat my meals.</p>

<p>Is it ok to chew less, has anyone experienced this having a noticeable effect on digestion?</p>

<p>One might assume that meat doesn’t need as much chewing, apparently cats don’t chew their food at all and then compare that to cows who’s only purpose in life is to chew it seems</p>
