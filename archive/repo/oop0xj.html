<div class="md"><p>Weightlifting subs are all pretty stringent on the content they allow and all redirect to <a href="/r/weightroom">/r/weightroom</a> for questions. The fact that they act like this probably turned away multiple people to other communities and must have actually discouraged some to pursue weight lifting at all</p>

<p>Maybe they got mad at my post history ; I use this account for 1) dumb questions 2) porn. Dumb either way, that&#39;s none of their business.</p>
