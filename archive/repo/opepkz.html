<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>My first fight in the cage was at 135, first in the ring at 131. Both I was ripped to my max potential at that weight literally. I call it me being young and hungry. But still undersized to my liking. That was when I was 16 and 17. I’m now 29, and completely confused. Gave up mma, boxing for chances at a new car, new home with slave labor. Now I’m 29, 8 years out of the gym, sloppy at 185, and desperate for answers. Is muscle memory gone? I remember being the 135 fight night 150 without cutting dumbbell benching 95s, 2-3 times without help. Now a couple times off my tow motor at work lifting 20-30 pounds for more than a few minutes makes me feel weak. Is muscle memory gone? Could I get it back?</p>

<div class="md"><p>musc memory is not like a hidden power, you have to train and it will assist you on the way (making it easier to come back to your old self) but the longer you dont train the weaker is the effekt</p>
