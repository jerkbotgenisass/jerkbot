<div class="md"><p>People are taking this serious here, aren&#39;t they?</p>

<p>It&#39;s a joke and as a sport bodybuilding is too. You can train your own way in the comfort of your gym and you never have to perform a singular feat of strength during a competition that your success depends on. You get to go to a beauty pageant and if you guessed wrong what they&#39;ll find attractive that year, or if your diet wasn&#39;t entirely on point, you&#39;ll lose because it&#39;ll show. Yes, you have to do sports to win, but so does Miss America, but in the end how well you performed in that sport doesn&#39;t matter at all. Nobody will judge your 1 rep max or your execution and form in the same way nobody will deduct points from a Miss America contestant because her time for running a mile was a little slow. And that whole drama with Breon and CBum, or Kai and Phil for example is so reminiscent of that whole pageant culture. Bodybuilding thrives on that, not on heavy lifts or feat of strength in an actual sport. That&#39;s why I say: They can&#39;t lift. There would be nothing wrong with it but everyone seems to be in denial, which is what make it so funny. A bit like if Manowar claimed they didn&#39;t look FABULOUUUUUS~ back then.</p>

<p>I’ve never done a half rep, bar gently touches chest on bench, squats to full depth, deadlifts are self explanatory</p>

<p>Edit:
Also most people don’t start with legitimate weight/strength training from the get go, lots start with poor weightlifting routines. But if you do start out immediately with a proper program you can put on a lot of strength fast. Noob gains if you will</p>

<p>I hiked frequently, mountain biked occasionally, and did yoga infrequently when I started lifting. Did the Stronglifts 5x5 program for 4 months then got a personal trainer at the gym and hit 1040 total for the big three after 6 months with the trainer.

With the weights these guys will be lifting, it doesn&#39;t take much for a serious injury to occur.

<div class="md"><p>The first hurdle in lifting really heavy weights is conquering pain and fear. There comes a point, well below most people&#39;s genetic max, where the weight hurts to have on your back, or hold over your chest, etc. and it puts people off. There also comes a point where people just get way too scared holding that much weight anyway. The first time you walk out with 150kg on your back to squat is a fucking scary day ... And a thrill for some.</p>

<p>The guys who get to the absolute peak of strength sports have an insane mental game just to get there, lot alone succeed.</p>

<p>Most people who hurt themselves deadlifting fuck up their form.  They get really focused on lifting a weight, and let their back start to round or hunch their shoulders or any of a huge number of different things.  Deadlift is a great lift, but it&#39;ll fuck you up in a hurry if you&#39;re an ego lifter</p>

<div class="md"><p>That&#39;s because Bolt broke the next barriers.  It was pretty widely believed 9.7 was barely attainable, and 9. 6 was beyond what humans could do.

Thousands of people have run faster than a 4 minute mile...but none of them got a knighthood or multiple biographical movies.  Just the first guy to do it.  </p>

<div class="md"><p>To expand on this: A deadlift is primarily a hip extension exercise. The primary movement is rotating your femur from flexed (femur towards chest) to femur neutral (femur in line with torso, i.e. standing upright.)</p>

<p>During competition, they need to easily measure if this movement went far enough: did the hips fully extend? But it&#39;s kind of hard to see since there are a bunch of joints moving: the ankles, the knees, even possibly the spine (though when deadlifting properly the spine should not move. It should stay in a straight line.)</p>

<p>So, deadlifting rules usually require that a successful deadlift is: knees locked and shoulders back. It&#39;s nearly impossible to lock your knees and have your shoulders back without the hip being fully extended.</p>

<p>It&#39;s called a &quot;lock out&quot; because many lifts require fully locked joints (for deadlift locked knees and for bench press locked elbows.) But note that hip extension the joint doesn&#39;t lock out on a successful lift (you can keep extending your hip back, like when you draw your leg back to prepare to kick a ball.) And if you have hyper mobile joints, you can hyper extend your knees or elbows and they won&#39;t be &quot;locked&quot; but people shouldn&#39;t do that during a lift.</p>

<div class="md"><p>Your body needs to create a lot of tension to be able to lift heavy weight. You need to hold your breath and &quot;brace&quot; your muscles in a manner that makes your body as rigid as possible in order to get the correct leverage from your muscles and joints. Combine this with the belt he&#39;s wearing and the deadlift suit he has on, both to compress his body and give himself more leverage. Powerlifters, especially equipped lifters often get light headed, pass out, break blood vessels and get bloody noses. Not all people do but it happens. </p>

<div class="md"><p>Howdy, I work in healthcare and have a fair bit of anatomical knowledge. </p>

<p>What you&#39;re seeing is not a jaw muscle, but is actually his superficial (meaning closer to the surface, relatively) temporal vein. It&#39;s just, as we say in my field, dilated and engorged as fuck.</p>

<p>There actually aren&#39;t any jaw muscles in that area. Your main jaw muscles are: </p>

<p>The masseter, the strongest muscle in the body in proportion to its size, located almost right in front of your ear and it goes down to the ramus (angled part) of the jaw. </p>

<p>The temporalis, which is a large muscle that covers the surface of most of the side of your head. </p>

<p>The pterygoids, which are right in front of your masseter, and and their function is to elevate (close) the TMJ, or temporomandibular joint.</p>

<p>On that note, TMJ is not a jaw condition, even though it is colloquially known as one. TMJ is an acronym for the joint, and you would call the condition TMJ dysfunction.</p>

<div class="md"><p>A big part of power lifting especially at this level involves using a breathing technique called vasalva to basically &quot;pressurize&quot; your torso which I guess assists with the lifting. Whatever this pressurizing phenomena is it creates more forceful lifts. This process massively increases blood pressure. Yeah he&#39;s stretching the vessel on the side of his head. ALSO notice the tightly fastened orange jumpsuit he wears for the lift and then gets out of quickly. That is a compression suit to aid the vasalva I think.</p>

<div class="md"><p>For squat a suit did me about +120 pounds. Add some knee wraps and it would be a about +150 or + 175 if everything was going well that day. Really when I did compete in powerlifting I felt my mental state more than anything g determined what numbers I would be hitting.</p>

<div class="md"><p>All of these answers are incorrect. He’s yelling “Abol Fazl” which is something he does often. It is the name of an Islamic Shiite Martyr popular in Iran. The reason he yells his name is because  Abol Fazl was the brother of Imam Hussein and was known as one of his strongest warriors. He’s even more relevant here because according to his story, Abol Fazl had his hands chopped off in combat but after he carried water back and forth with his teeth and his handless arms to his comrades that were wounded on the battlefield and could not get water for themselves. In Iranian culture,  peiman yelling his name is a form of paying homage.</p>

<p>You can&#39;t breath properly when you&#39;re wearing one of those, so they make sure to free their friend as soon as he is done with the lift.</p>

<p>You know those resistance bands people use in gyms? They have different &quot;resistances&quot;: 20 lbs, 40 lbs... Now imagine a suit made of resistance bands, and when you bend over to pick up the weight it tenses, and when you stand up with the weight it HELPS you stand up with the weight.</p>

<p>That kind of equipment is allowed in &quot;strongman&quot; competitions, but not in powerlifting competitions (different strength sport).</p>

<div class="md"><p>Now that you mention it, it&#39;s rare but it exists. I&#39;m thinking of Andy Bolton when he broke the deadlift world record back then. I think it was a powerlifting meet and he was using a suit and no straps.</p>

<div class="md"><p>The comp will dictate what’s allowed. </p>

<p>Personally I could care less for comps that allow power suites. Much like how <a href="https://www.inverse.com/innovation/olympic-glory-week-lzr-swimsuits">olympic swim suits were banned</a> power lifting suits should be banned as well. </p>

<p>Obviously it’s a lot of weight and lots of work went into getting to that point, but wearing a suit takes away from the achievement IMO. </p>

<p>Of course, if you don’t want to compete against lifters in suits, it’s as simple as not competing in those comps. </p>

<p>And be for the “wHaT abOuT BeltS AnD WrAps?” questions…I’m ok with belts and kinda against knee wraps. </p>

<p>No i don’t compete.</p>

<p>That’s some strong ass velcro.</p>
