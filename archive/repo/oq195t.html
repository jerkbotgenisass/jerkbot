Is there a hack to tracking calories

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I’ve always been someone who tries to avoid this part of any diet, hell I did Keto just so Id only have focus on carbs. I recently went to a nutritionist and she suggested having a limit of about 2200 calories. I felt it’s always been a chore to the point where it discourages most people from dieting. Is there any kind of trick or lifehack that I’m not aware of</p>

<div class="md"><p>The thing that helped me turn counting into a habit was using MyFitnessPal in the mornings to plan and pre-log my entire day’s meals. Seeing the food listed with the total calories made it easier for me to stick to my diet as well. </p>

<p>Just a small tip but hopefully it’s useful!</p>

<div class="md"><p>Do you already have a food scale by chance? Really comes in handy. </p>

<p>And as another little tip for MyFitnessPal; if you ever can’t find a food measured by grams in the app, actually type “grams” after the food item in the search bar and often times that will give you better results. Really helps when you don’t want to take the time to convert a “cup of grapes” to grams. </p>

<p>Just be sure you cross reference with your nutrition label or other sources to make sure it’s accurate!</p>

<div class="md"><p>I agree that apps, while nice since they can track macros and nutrients easily, sometimes become a chore to scroll through the list of search results to ultimately not find the right match then have to enter the food yourself.</p>

<p>Im back to using an app now, but when I started counting this time, I started with a pen and paper, and I kept them on the counter in my kitchen (and tracked just the cals, no macros). This was really helpful for me since it&#39;s way faster, and I&#39;d always know where that paper is, where sometimes I dont know where my phone is.</p>

<div class="md"><p>A few pieces of advice I have on this, that admittedly might not work for everyone but do work for me:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Pick your battles. You really don&#39;t have to weigh and measure <strong>everything</strong> to be successful. For example I never log my herbs/spices because it&#39;s just not worth the time or effort. I log vegetables, but I just eyeball the amount instead of actually weighing them out. Yes, a calorie is a calorie, but let&#39;s be honest, no one ever got fat because they were eating too many vegetables or too much paprika. I find that these little &#39;eh fuck it&#39; moments don&#39;t impede my progress in any measurable way, but take a lot of mental strain out of it. </p></li>
<li><p>Find a handful of recipes, meals, and snacks that you like. Eat them repeatedly. Most tracking apps have a copy and paste feature where you can just load in recipes or previous meals. Even if you need to make small adjustments, this is still a big effort and time saver.</p></li>
<li><p>Understand that you will never be 100% accurate because all the calorie counts provided to you are simply estimates. You should try to be accurate and consistent, but don&#39;t let yourself get all worked up in super minor details. </p></li>
<li><p>It is a huge chore, which is why I give myself days off regularly (three or four days a month). These are not excuses to binge and gorge myself, they&#39;re just days off from the tediousness of tracking. I still eat more or less the same foods, I just do it without tracking. Ultimately, no one is going to be tracking forever, it&#39;s just not sustainable. So I think it&#39;s good to learn to exist in that middle ground between strict tracking and eating thoughtlessly. This might not work for everyone, but again, it&#39;s never stopped me from losing.</p></li>

<div class="md"><p>This is great. I agree that some measurements are just not worth the sweat. Like I track a lot of &quot;large apples&quot; or &quot;cups&quot; of lettuce that I&#39;ve just eyeballed instead of weighing.</p>

<div class="md"><p>I personally track fruit because it can be surprisingly high calorie (looking at you, bananas) but it&#39;ll snow in hell before I devote any time to measuring lettuce lol</p>

<div class="md"><p>Food scale and pre logging is my biggest tip. Don’t have time for measuring cups or spoons plus it is way more accurate. While I’m watching TV the night before I quickly enter in at least my breakfast and lunch. I buy mostly the same base of groceries week to week so it’s pretty easy.</p>

<div class="md"><p>Sometimes you gotta do chores and do things the hard way (or in a way that you are not used to) to get results. Keep doing what you are doing and continue to get what you are getting. Good luck!</p>

<div class="md"><p>Get a tracker app that you can scan barcodes with. Saves so much time just quickly scanning them as most items will have nutrition/calorie info prefilled by other users. Also if you&#39;re someone who makes the same meals often, record those as recipes in the app (I know Lose It offers this, not sure about other apps but I&#39;m sure there are heaps that do), then you don&#39;t need to log separate ingredients every time.</p>

<div class="md"><p>Using an app helps a lot! Once you get used to it it will only take a minute or so to log your meals. The longer you track, you will start to remember the calorie counts for foods that you frequently eat so you won&#39;t have to spend so much time searching and logging.</p>

<div class="md"><p>I usually log something from a chain that appears similar in size. It&#39;s not perfect, but it gets me in the a ballpark. For example there&#39;s a mom and pop pizza place in my city that has no calorie info, so I&#39;ll just log the equivalent pizza size and toppings from Papa John&#39;s and call it a day.</p>

<li>Order your groceries online so you can go back and check nutrition labels in Kroger/Publix/Walmart app without having to run into the kitchen. </li>
