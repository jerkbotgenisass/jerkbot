Any success for skinny guy.

<div class="post">
<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I was wondering if there are many people who have successfully gained muscle mass while starting out skinny without using peds? No judgement against people who use peds I just don&#39;t want to personally.</p>

<p>I&#39;m 147 and 5&#39;10&quot; but eating carbs at the minute. So I will likely weigh 140 once I&#39;ve returned back to keto.</p>

<p>My goal is to reach 155. Lifting heavy 3 times a week or possibly more providing recovery is improved. </p>

<p>How feasible does this sound? Ideally I would want to reach this target within 2 years but 12 months would be a dream.</p>

<p>I have no problem getting the extra calories in in theory, but I once doubled my calories to 4500 a day for 3 weeks and lost 1 pound while I was already skinny which I couldn&#39;t understand.</p>

<p>If somebody is an expert that can help I&#39;d be happy to pay for a consultation via Skype. Not sure if <a href="/u/darthluiggi">/u/darthluiggi</a> does this?</p>

<p>Thank you</p>

<div class="md"><p>Why do you want to go keto? I think it will be harder to gain weight personally, especially if you are a naturally skinny person. I also would be a bit concerned about adding tons of fat for bulking.</p>

<p>Keto works just fine for muscle gain, but its not optimal - not that optimization is needed for 99.9% of normal people.</p>

<p>For someone in your situaton, I would say do what you enjoy the most and be consistant. The rest is really not that important.</p>

<p>&#x200B;</p>

<p>PS.. as a 5&#39;11 male who is having to eat 1400 calories a day to cut and starving.. I hate you. :)</p>

<div class="md"><p>The main reason is around consistent energy and brain function. I have a highly demanding occupation that requires intense and long periods of thinking clearly. No other diet comes close in this regard and being keto equals a lot more $$$.</p>

<p>But I also want to gain some muscle for general functioning etc. Do you have any advice for workouts or tips that might help? Consistency is no problem for me. But am I deluded expecting to see the number on the scale change or will I just end up a ripped 140 pounder?</p>

<div class="md"><p>I think we all have genetic limitations, but you wont really know until you try. It seems like your body adapts to high calories very quickly which keeps you from gaining weight. I also suspect that your body upregulates your NEAT to a very high level to compenstate for the high calories.</p>

<p>If you plan to bulk on keto, then here are my tips:</p>

<p>&#x200B;</p>

<p>I would elminate cardio during your bulk.</p>

<p>I would drastically increase your healthy fat consumpion - salmon, lake trout, sardines, avocado, coconut oils, Tuna with avocado oil. The goal is to add a lot of calories in the least amount of volumn possible.</p>

<p>Eat lots of nuts - pecans and macadamians if you can afford them.</p>

<p>Add in dairy, butters in moderation - I would avoid too many non-healthy fats, but 50 grams daily is probably okay.</p>

<p>Add in lot of fattier meat choices - rib eye, ribs, NY strips, skirt steak, 80 ground beef.</p>

<p>Push your carbs up to 30 or 40, 50  if you can remain in ketosis. This will aid in recovery and allow more training, but you can also pair the carbs with some fats to increase appetite. We know that carbs mixed with fat are what makes people fat - so go for it.</p>

<p>track your macros like you would when cutting - If you dont know how much you are eating, then how do you know if you are eating enough?</p>

<p>Increase your workout freqency if able and focus on hypertrophy. Hypertrophy is better in a bulk, because it gains more muscle which leads to more strenght potential down the road. I like to train strength during maintainance.</p>

<div class="md"><p>Thanks for the help. I&#39;ll take all of this on board. Really appreciate your time to reply.</p>

<p>Some point I would make is that I used to eat 60-70g carbs on some days and still remained in ketosis so maybe I need to be more consistent in that regard.</p>

<div class="md"><p>Mind if I ask your age? Also 4500kcal diet should not make you lose weight (barring medical reasons), I think your calorie count might be off a bit.</p>

<p><a href="https://seannal.com/articles/quick-tips/4500-calorie-meal-plan.php">Here’s a diet plan (not keto) that you might want to compare yours with,</a> and see if you’re actually consuming this much cals.</p>

<p>I do think it’ll be very doable and manageable to gain 15 lbs in a year so keep up the good work!</p>

<li>Super fast metabolism. I weighed and tracked everything. I was training every day for 2 hours, but it still just didn&#39;t make much sense to me at the time. I hypothesized my brain was burning extra calories when they were there, but that&#39;s a slightly whacky idea that I didn&#39;t give too much thought.</li>
</ol>

<p>I have just spoken with an expert and they said that it&#39;s extremely unlikely I gain 10lbs in a year without doing CKD. So I guess I&#39;ll give that a shot.</p>

<div class="md"><p>You say you tracked everything, do you have a food scale at home to measure out your portions?  Perhaps you are eye-balling or measuring your intake by volume which can often leave a lot of room for error.</p>

<p>Can you provide an example of what a day of eating 4500kcal actually looked like for you?</p>

<p>If you are <em>truly</em> consuming 4500kcal and not gaining weight then I would get yourself tested for thyroid regulation or other issues that have a large impact on metabolism.</p>

<p>Edit: Also, what does your 2hrs of training look like? Perhaps if it involves a lot of cardio or short rest periods then you should change your approach to minimize calories burned and focus on heavy lifting.</p>

<div class="md"><p>Everything I ate was weighed. I used my fitness pal to measure totals. I used to eat 6 eggs baked with butter and fatty pieces of meat. A large portion of meat, 400g porkbelly, 650g ribeye are examples. Bacon most days. A keto shake of berries, 2 avocado and some added protein and mct. The rest of my calories were from bulletproof coffee 50g total fat and olive oil. I&#39;m on phone but there&#39;s some other greens etc in there that was the bulk of it. 
Training was intense I suppose. 1 hour jiu jitsu and 12 5 minute rounds back to back. I seemed to lose the same weight regardless of calories.</p>

<div class="md"><p>Hmm, lack of precise measurement is usually the cause of these situations, but if you’re truly weighing everything you eat and it amounts to that high of a calorie count then you may truly be one of the exceptions with a medical issue. I would honestly get that checked out and assessed if you’ve tried this much and are still finding the results to be lacklustre.</p>

<p>Edit: Additionally, that training is actually quite intense and could burn a substantial amount of calories, though I find it hard to believe that 4500kcal isn’t enough. As crazy as it sounds, have you tried eating more calories? I’d imagine at some point it’s simply difficult to eat that much. Are you able to reduce your training at all while you’re figuring out these weight issues?</p>

<div class="md"><p>Yeah I can basically drop cardio. I used to lift much lighter too. So I&#39;m just going to focus on heavy weights from now on and see how it goes for 3 months. If I can gain 2.5lbs of muscle in that time I will stick with it and embrace the grind. Thanks for your help</p>

<div class="md"><p>Hey OP!</p>

<p>I&#39;ve been skinny my entire life and and just recently started working out while doing my damn hardest to be on a strict keto diet. </p>

<p>Keto may not be optimal for the gains but the mental benefits are way more important to me as I have ADHD and the symptoms reduce drastically. </p>

<p>Im 5&#39;10 and started working out at 145 pounds and within 2 months I gained about 5ish pounds and my wife says she sees a big difference in body mass haha. </p>

<p>I made sure to hit my protein goal of 150g, limit carbs to 30g and fill the rest with healthy fats such as avocados, macadamia nuts for a total of 3100 calories. </p>

<p>Im not an expert but im going to stick with it as I do way feel WAY better mentally and physically then ever before in my life.</p>

<p>Also you gotta ask your self what makes you happier!</p>
