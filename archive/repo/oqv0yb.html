<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Honestly I work out to satisfy my partner and myself, I can move decent weight but the cardio is lacking a bit I can run 2km in 25 minutes but otherwise I feel fine.</p>

<p>Now on to the frutidelicous stuff, I&#39;m strong I can pound it hard but I get cramps every single time, this started happening since I started taking cell tech because creatine is out of stock, I already tried upping the water intake but I&#39;m afraid I&#39;ll end up hurting myself in the gym if I get a cramp mid rep.</p>

<p>Any experience with this?</p>

<div class="md"><p>I actually get cramps with cardio if I do drink water right before or during. The only thing that works for me is to drink water after cardio.</p>
