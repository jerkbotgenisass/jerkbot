<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I am new to carnivore and made the poor decision to eat too much fat.  As in burgers fried in beef tallow and I also saved the grease and dipped my burgers in it.  My body was definitely not ready for that much fat yet and now I&#39;ve been very nauseous and bloated for the last two days.  Yesterday was horrible and I didn&#39;t eat anything, which probably didn&#39;t help.  Today, I am still very bloated with some mild nausea and very little appetite.  Unfortunately, I think my lack of eating yesterday caused me to relapse this morning, on my 5th day and binge majorly on carbs.  They didn&#39;t even really taste good, but I feel that&#39;s a good thing.  I was just wondering if it&#39;s normal to be this bloated and nauseous this long afterwards?  I feel like it should be out of my system by now.</p>
