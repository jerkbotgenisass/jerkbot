Trying to gain weight but the only difference I am seeing is fat gain on my stomach and sides.

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I have only been eating proteins but I don&#39;t see any muscle gain despite working out a lot with a personal trainer. What do I do? What could be going wrong? Before this I lost about 80 pounds in a year and felt my body was perfect with 6 percent body fat but a lot of people told me that I was looking thin and malnourished so I began gaining. I am 5 feet 11 and was 59 kgs until 10 days ago. Now I am 65 after 5 days of dirty gaining but I feel like I am bloated, my face seems puffy and my stomach definition has totally gone. Could this be water weight? How do I put on muscle?</p>

<div class="md"><p>You should use the ketogains macro calculator and input your goals.  If by &quot;dirty gaining&quot; you mean you ate a bunch of carbs, yes, it&#39;s water weight.  If you want to gain weight while on keto, you add fat.</p>

<div class="md"><p>Yes I had eaten a lot of carbs for 4 days and am about 2.5 kgs above my normal weight from last week. My stomach seems double the normal size. Idk what to do. I have exercised a lot today.</p>

<div class="md"><p>That will do it</p>

<p>Slamming a bunch of carbs will bloat you up and make you seem fatter</p>

<div class="md"><p>The thing is that when I did this in the past it used to go back within a day of rigorous exercise but it didn&#39;t. Could any of it be due to muscle gain as well? My chest seems a lot more muscular tbh and even during the Binge I have worked hard with my workouts. </p>

<p>When and how do you think this bloat will go away? At this point I don&#39;t know if I should actually be working towards making it go away tbh as I have been underweight</p>

<div class="md"><p>Right. But rabbit meat is like pure protein. Or chicken breast with no skin. </p>

<p>As opposed to steak or veal or bacon.</p>

<div class="md"><p>Why would you think he is eating chicken breast with no skin or rabbit, and also suddenly gained a bunch of fat?  This is a very odd thing to assume.</p>
