<p>It was really interesting. Also makes it notable how much energy this guy has (someone else posted a link to a compilation of him in various competitions) because the journalist in Muscle talks about how during competition the bodybuilders are weak as kittens... The gain all the muscle then in the weeks before competition they extreme diet to lose body fat and right beforehand massively dehydrate themselves so the muscles will show. I also always remember the part where he talks about how much the bottom of his feet hurt when he was competition ready because he was so heavy from muscle but had dieted down so he didn&#39;t have enough fat on the bottoms of his feet for padding.</p>

<div class="md"><p>The other thing most strongmen and bodybuilders often talk about as being one of the hardest things is fueling a body like this.  Having to eat 5000+ calories a day with hundreds of grams of protein, 4-6 full meals of something bland like plain or extremely lightly seasoned salmon or chicken breast + brown rice and veg. Half a dozen egg whites for breakfast every day. Limited if any sauce or condiments, maybe a squirt of sugar free ketchup or BBQ sauce.  Multiple protein shakes, being completely full and having to eat another full 900 calorie meal, and another one 2 hours later.</p>

<p>Most of the top level strength and fitness athletes basically have to eat from the moment they get up to the moment they sleep every single day without fail, and it just sounds so monotonous and tough to do. And that&#39;s without having even considered the actual work they do in the gym then.</p>

<div class="md"><p>I&#39;m in a surplus rn and I&#39;m eating 3700 calories. Nearly 290g of protein 100g of fat and 410g of carbs. Of that, my non whole foods are 2 protein shakes (48g of P) and 2 protein bars which are one bars which are I think 40/20/8 pcf and during workouts half a scoop of karbolyn which is 25g of C. Outside of that I&#39;m constantly eating. But it&#39;s not plain. We&#39;re allowed to use seasoning and our best friend is siracha. Also our proteins are usually chicken salmon or steak. Chicken is high P low fat, salmon is balance between p and F usually one for one eating white fish like basa is pure protein no fats. Steak depending on what cut can be high fat and high P. Sirloin is the best option since its low in fat. Most of these guys in prep don&#39;t eat 5600. Before the show they are lucky to get 1800. To get to that point they eat clean yes. But it&#39;s more important to hit macros than anything.</p>

<div class="md"><p>It&#39;s as much about the macros of what you eat as the calories you are eating. They have to maintain a certain ratio of protein to fat to carbs.

<div class="md"><p>Oh it’s fucking horrible. I never legit trained to be a bodybuilder but I used to work out with them and did my tiny 4 meals a day 200-250 grams of protein (I say tiny 4 meals because the dudes I worked out with ate 5-6 massive meals a day). We also used to lift 1-2 times a day, 6 days a week for 1.5-2 hours a pop. The lifting is the fun part but the eating is a whole different thing. </p>

<p>I started working out again now after stopping for 4 years and I cannot for the life of me eat enough or right. I will never go back to scarfing down those nasty ass protein shakes mixed with water, piles of plain ground beef with spinach, 8 full eggs right away in the morning with no seasoning, etc and I know it’s hurting my progress. The amount of discipline it takes to do this shit is nuts and I have a massive amount of respect for adults with real jobs on the side who also take the time to do this.</p>

<p>The reason why BB&#39;s ain&#39;t as strong as powerlifters and what not is due to different training.</p>

<div class="md"><p>I&#39;m a body builder. I do competitions. I&#39;m preparing to get to his size by next year. And yes I am very passionate about what I do. I love answering questions. People think it&#39;s boring to do what I do. The caloric surplus is always enjoyable, and you can eat anything you want really as long as you hit your macros. Once you&#39;re in prep and sub 75g of carbs and sub 45g of fat, you need to measure everything to a tee and be as close as bang on as you can. That part sucks since you&#39;re generally irritable at least I am. But the maintenance state when you&#39;re not really bulking or perping is generally fun food wise. </p>

<p>Keep in mind through all of this you&#39;re working out 5-6x a week + cardio. The cardio is much less during bulk. But during fat loss and prep it&#39;s 90min a day usually + weights.</p>

<div class="md"><p>Oh cool thanks I have questions :)</p>

<p>Does prep mean when you&#39;re getting into bodybuilding or when you&#39;re getting ready for a show?</p>

<p>What does &quot;hitting your macros&quot; mean? Is it macronutrient targets? Like a minimum target for protein and maximum for carbs and fat? Sorry whenever people start talking about numbers and measuring their food my brain glazes over!</p>

<div class="md"><p>Prep is just getting ready for a show. You start prep around 6 months out. You reverse diet yourself into a deficit. You can&#39;t just go from eating 2500kcal in maintenance mode to 1200 in a deficit. You need to week by week adjust your food to lower it so your body doesn&#39;t freak out. </p>

<p>Macros are what most body builders go by. We don&#39;t really use calories since that in itself is useless when looking at the big picture. Since 1g of fat is 9calories and 1g of protein is 4 and 1g of carbs is 4. When I&#39;m saying hit your macros it means if my spread is 250/50/50 (PCF). </p>

<p>So when your spread is that low you want to eat high protein and low fat food like chicken breast 9oz cooked is 75/0/8 that means throughout the day I need 175/50/42 for my macros. When you&#39;re this low on carbs you want to eat high in fiber like sweet potato with skin, a bit of oatmeal etc. </p>

<p>Measuring food is tricky at the start but easy once you get the hang of it.</p>

Ask him about any major body builder and he can list off so much info about them, Diets, exercises, it&#39;s insane. Honestly all his muscles and everything was part of what put me off about him (when we first started dating) because I assumed muscles = a total dickhead and I could not have been more wrong. </p>

<p>All of the body builders I have met are incredibly sweet and genuinely care about others too. They constantly want to jump in a help people in the gym and they get super excited when they see another regular (gym goer) making real progress. It is a LOT of hard work and intense discipline, it&#39;s a job that they take incredibly serious. </p>

<p>I&#39;ve told other girls who have been nervous about going to the gym &quot;if you have questions about an exercise or even maybe someone is making you uncomfortable at the gym, go find the body builder. He will be more than ecstatic in helping you and will be the 1st person to want to protect you. The gym is honestly one of the safest places a girl can be because all the dudes really do care and would immediately jump to aid&quot;</p>

<div class="md"><p>Bodybuilders tend to be self absorbed, think of what they do after all.</p>

<p>I think the best way to get a feel for how bodybuilders are is to find the doc Generation Iron and watch the <a href="https://horsespirit.site/2020/03/10/confident-bodybuilder-falls-off-a-horse/">horse fall</a>.</p>

<p>A guy who has no business on a horse gets interviewed atop one because he is all about image projection and he fucks up staying atop a standing horse so bad he puts himself out of competition.</p>

<p>It really sums up how it has stopped being about self development and become a toxic masculinity image machine at high levels and the people that produces.</p>

<div class="md"><p>A lot of people are self-absorbed, bodybuilders or not. It&#39;s just channeled and expressed differently. There&#39;s at least an honesty to how upfront and transparent they are about it that is refreshing. I mean, unless you get one of those obnoxious ones that rationalize it away but I don&#39;t think I&#39;ve seen one.</p>

<div class="md"><p>Hehe, yup. Bodybuilders who manage to keep their hair when they reach Men&#39;s Open levels of muscle are rare. You see lots of guys with hair in the Men&#39;s Physique category, and then a bit less in Classic Physique... and then in Men&#39;s Open, they&#39;re practically all bald.    </p>

<p>To keep your hair at that level, you need a drug protocol on TOP of the steroid protocol, which is just another burden on the body. Iain Valliere is one of the only guys at the top level who&#39;s talked openly about his finasteride use.</p>

<div class="md"><p>The different skin color is for a good reason. Bodybuilders lather their body in bronzer before going on stage, due to the fact darker skin shows muscle definition better than lighter skin cause y’know … shadows and depth.

<div class="md"><p>I&#39;ve lifted weights since my early 20s going on 15+ yrs now. As a Korean dude, I never found the appeal in getting that big. Additionally, most girls think it&#39;s disgusting when you&#39;re that bulky. </p>

<p>At my peak I&#39;m usually 140-150lbs, 5-7% body fat, bench 245lbs or just do 80-85lbs dumbbells. I used to want to get big like Arnold, then saw what happens to bodybuilders&#39; bodies after they age. It&#39;s not worth all the health risks and sagging skin and blubber. It&#39;s no rocket science that all those 7k+ calories and tearing and healing muscles, eventually comes back to hurt you.</p>

<div class="md"><p>I have trouble believing this based on how artificial testosterone works.</p>

<p>I mean it improves healing rates, so these people are still damaging muscles somehow.</p>

<p>EDIT: Already found one problem. It said that the weight lifting group performed weight training 3 times weekly.</p>

<p>A large part of the point of testosterone is that it improves muscle recovery rates, so you can train the same muscle groups more frequently. These guys were only training three times a week. I doubt they were doing the right amount of training to see increased muscle gain.</p>

<div class="md"><p>The muscle is often weird though. My bf is really into body building and he can look at someone and tell immediately if they are on any kind of steroid. He only has done one round of testosterone once before the only big competition he ever did and wouldn&#39;t do it again, but he used to hang around juicers a lot and even had to help a guy at his gym inject it every day for money, so he knows what it looks like. Apparently there&#39;s a guy at our gym who is using steroids but not working out properly or enough (spends much of his time at the gym sitting on his phone) and he is a big guy, but does have a strange muscle distribution. I wouldn&#39;t be able to pick it out but he&#39;s shown me pictures and it definitely looks like that&#39;s whats up. </p>

<p>There&#39;s a subreddit called <a href="/r/nattyorjuice">r/nattyorjuice</a> where people guess if a person is using steroids and he can call it like immediately.</p>

<div class="md"><p>The most commonly misinterpreted study in the realm of people who don&#39;t understand bodybuilding/AAS who want to comment on how steroids do everything for you. This study demonstrates that LEAN BODY MASS increases while using AAS (in this case 600mg Testosterone per week). LEAN BODY MASS includes water and glycogen. Testosterone, like most AAS, rapidly increase glycogen reuptake which adds fluid mass to muscle bellies. This <em>is not</em> new muscle tissue. Additionally, Testosterone aromatizes into Estrogen which increases subcutaneous water retention. You know how women often report fluctuations in bodyweight alongside their menstrual cycle? Would you consider their 5lbs of increased bloat to be increased muscle?  </p>

<p>Anyone who takes 600mg a week of Testosterone for 10-12 weeks and makes no additional changes will see no improvements in muscle mass or strength 6 weeks after stopping supplementation.  </p>

<p>Yippee, 10lbs of glycogen for 10 weeks and then nothing.</p>

Most advertisements for SARMs seldom include side effects info for two reasons: a)the product is placebo/weak testosterone booster b)they don&#39;t want to publicize that information. Which is obviously a terrible thing.</p>

<div class="md"><p>I 100% agree that a lot of the health problems normally associated with steroids can be mitigated, however I don&#39;t think that it&#39;s a definitive solution. Just as an alcoholic can recover and live a healthy life afterwards, I think the lifespan is certainly lower than if they never drank alcohol in the first place, all else being equal.</p>

<div class="md"><p>I&#39;m really not certain about the lifespan thing. Most Mr.Olympia winners live well into their 80s, Frank Zane is currently 79,  Chris Dickerson is 81. <strong>None</strong> died before they were 70. Which is, in my opinion, a very fine age, while you still have most of your memory intact, your body hasn&#39;t deteriorated yet, and your grandchildren are old enough to remember you.</p>

<p>Although on the other hand, most jacked up bodybuilders are from 00s and 10s, and we&#39;re yet to see how they are doing in the next 10 years. Lee Haney seems to be in great shape at 61, and I wish him all the best.</p>

<p>I like how you snuck the C option in there, as if some bro with severe body dysmorphia and a BB.com account is in some way qualified at the same level as specialists with 10+ years medical training. </p>

<p>No credible licensed endocrinologist or cardiologist is going to tell you anything pleasant about abusing PEDs, and the guy permanently posted up by the leg press machines with the fanny pack doesn&#39;t know what he&#39;s talking about. </p>

<blockquote>

<p>This is a fallacy. Nobody over 25 with free test over 1700 is using &quot;in moderation&quot; or with caution, and you don&#39;t even have to leave your local hometown gym to spot dudes blasting at twice that amount. </p>

<p>Even moderate PED abuse dramatically increases your risk of cancers throughout the endocrine and reproductive systems, along with heart failure, stroke, hepatitis, acute cardiomegaly, acute and chronic pancreatitis, ruptured tendons and severe joint damage, aneurisms and blood clotting, and jaundice. That&#39;s beyond the less dangerous or painful side effects, such as man tits, baldness, cystic acne, shrunken testicles, decreased sperm, and the inability of the body to produce its own test (possibly forever).</p>

<p>Quoting cherry-picked stats about Mr. Olympians is misleading. For every guy like Arnold who makes it to old age, there&#39;s a Rich Piana dead in his 40s or guys like Ronnie Coleman and Lee Priest whose bodies are beyond fucked and will require surgeries for the rest of their painful lives.</p>

<p>All of those (except baldness maybe, but I already have male pattern baldness without any PED so what do I know) are preventable via usage of PCT and consulting with specialists.</p>

<p>You&#39;re missing the point, if one&#39;s planning to use steroids, they should do extensive freaking research about everything, do lots of tests and consult the doctors.</p>

<div class="md"><p>I&#39;ve never seen any sensible athlete encourage steroid use. Unless of course they&#39;re media gypsies trying to shill for a SARM or prohormone. Out of all the gym coaches and just brosephs that I know, all of them were pretty clear that while they don&#39;t regret using roids or HGH, they wouldn&#39;t recommend without advisory from a physician and endocrinologist.</p>

<div class="md"><p>i was more talking about the general anatomy - like that dude doesn&#39;t have <em>extra</em> muscles due to the gear, they&#39;re just fucking gigantic. </p>

<p>i&#39;ve heard conflicting stories/research about the non-active gains from gearing, so i&#39;m not confident in either side of that argument personally. i think the general consensus is that gear shortens your refractory period, and reduces potential injury from overload, but you still gotta put the work in if you want to look remotely like this dude.</p>

<div class="md"><p>Look, this dude is obviously training and paying attention to how big he builds each muscle group. The point the person your replying to was making is that there are some (small sample size) studies that have shown that people who take AAS and don&#39;t train gain as much or more lean mass as people who do train but dont take AAS.</p>

<p>I actually think that a much bigger problem than bodybuilders, who virtually everyone knows are on steroids, are Hollywood celebs. They have much more influence and I don&#39;t think I&#39;ve ever seen a single one admit the rampant AAS abuse involved in looking like a superhero. A lot of young men grow up with ridiculous body image expectations and even if they get fit, train 5 times a week and eat right, they won&#39;t look like this guy or most Hollywood action heroes.</p>

<div class="md"><p>Yeah the one thing that is sort of a shame about modern body building. Growth hormone makes everything grow bigger, which is great for bigger muscles, but I heard it makes <em>everything</em> grow bigger, including the guts — hence the larger stomach area. It seems like if you look at body builders from decades ago the stomach area was much narrower because they didn&#39;t use growth hormone and the trunk stayed trim.</p>

<p>You&#39;ve heard wrong. Bodybuilders eat more than usual the day before going on stage, particularly carbs, in order to &quot;carb up&quot; the muscle. Otherwise, they&#39;d look deflated. You&#39;re right about the dehydration though, diuretics are often used and can be dangerous if overdone</p>

<p>Wrong. The Science is clear. Taking a basic testosterone supplement and sitting on a couch doing nothing will literally build more muscle than a natural weightlifter working their hardest over the same time period.</p>

<div class="md"><p>That’s from one study from like 10 people that didn’t even take glycogen/nitrogen retention into account. Steroids do NOT cause linear growth in muscle. The more you put on the harder it is to put more on. I’m willing to bet every dollar if they let that study go another 3-4 months the natural group would have surpassed the supplemented not working out group.</p>

<div class="md"><p>Well I do agree with you, it still does take ridiculous training, but they have compared testosterone supplementation + training vs either or none, and they definitely found that JUST using testosterone and NOT training actually improves body composition and builds more muscle moreso than JUST training</p>

<div class="md"><p>Sure, tests will build some muscle without exercise but it doesn&#39;t even come close to what you&#39;re seeing here. </p>

<p>There&#39;s no way., to get this big without serious weight training, regimented eating, and steroids. Stop minimizing the hard work and dedication this bloke put it into it.</p>

<p>EDIT: TO be clear, it doesn&#39;t require 6hr/day training to get the results, that part is bs, but it does require training 4-5/week for 1-2hrs per session.</p>

<div class="md"><p>That study doesn’t take into account increased glycogen retention from the testosterone. Also there’s go to be a flat increase in size for sure once you start but I promise the growth curse is NOT linear. I know this from personal experience.

<p>They’re related. The guys aren’t “gassed out”, theyre dehydrated and starved of nutrients. That’s how they get so cut and dry, and that’s also why they’re so weak. This guy didn’t do that; that’s why he can dance</p>

<p>Also, pro bodybuilding shows are highly regulated as to what you do on stage- pre judging, judging, everything. Him being able to f about and dance and stuff, that tells me this is either a low level regional show, or, more likely, not a pure bodybuilding show at all. More likely some sort of expo show or something like that</p>

The human form is totally wild, like look at a really skinny man and a really skinny woman and compare that to a really ripped man and a really ripped woman. It&#39;s fascinating as hell.

<div class="md"><p>I&#39;m not sure about the Manga but the Anime is just not good. Like it is so melodramatic for an anime about men with more muscles than stars in the universe. It is also so absurd with its story and character development that you don&#39;t know what even is supposed to be happening.<br/>
The pacing is horrible, the animation is just bad (especially season 1), even the action scenes are nothing close to the TOP TEN ANIME BATTLES list.    </p>

<p>Season 1 was bad, season 2 was better with pacing as in they went through with all the shit much faster but ended like a wet fart. It&#39;s just not good. </p>

<p>So now you&#39;re wondering why I bothered watching 2 seasons if it isn&#39;t good. Well because it turns out the absurdity is so over the top I couldn&#39;t help but see how it finishes. 
If you want an example of the absurdity, they have Muhammad Ali Jr... That&#39;s right, in this universe Muhammad Ali has a son and he&#39;s one of the protagonists/antagonists and he has perfected MUHAMMEAD ALI MARTIAL ARTS.</p>

<div class="md"><p>To be fair, the Netflix anime picked a bizarre point of the manga to start at. They start at series 2, series 1 which is the actual start was made in the 90s I believe, with normal animation. And this is hands down the weakest part in my opinion, part three takes the absurdity through the roof.</p>

<div class="md"><p>I mean that video is about as honest as it gets. I&#39;m pretty sure he even states that the story is bizarre and it&#39;s pretty much just testosterone: the anime. I understand that&#39;s not everyone&#39;s taste, which is totally valid, but I don&#39;t think the YouTuber is at fault. Maybe try reading the manga, the cgi REALLY doesn&#39;t do it justice, the manga artist has a great way of drawing momentum and heavy panel breaking hits.</p>

<div class="md"><p>That&#39;s what I got from reading some reviews. The anime is bad and doesn&#39;t do justice to the manga.<br/>
But I still think my criticism for SEW is valid. He does do videos around anime culture and I took his word for it when he said Baki is worth the watch. He mentioned about the absurdity and bizarreness but none of that implies that the an anime is going to be bad but over the top. Many other anime are just bizarre and absurd but produced well and entertaining and so I assumed Baki was in the same basket.  I highly suspect it was a paid promotion on his part because the anime is just so bad nobody would actually recommend watching it.</p>

<div class="md"><p>I didn&#39;t read the manga, i watched a good portion of the netflix show and it was just so bad. I genuinely felt like I as a viewer was being disrespected. Like they set up all these villains as if they&#39;re important or Baki will fight them only to have them quickly cast aside for new villains or they simply fight a brand new character introduced in one episode then never shown again.  The story/plot felt like it changed or was forgotten from episode to episode. The only memorable/funny moment is that Baki gets a huge power up from having sex with his girlfriend for the first time. It was so stupid and hilarious, but that&#39;s all I allowed myself to remember.</p>

<div class="md"><p>Insulin abuse is likely the primary culprit.</p>

<p>Hgh entered bodybuilding before insulin abuse and we didn’t start to see bubble guts, but when insulin abuse became the norm the guts popped out pretty much overnight.</p>

<p>Steroids can cause fatty liver, HGH can cause all organ growth, and heavy insulin abuse can cause fattening of all organs, so they definitely all work together</p>
