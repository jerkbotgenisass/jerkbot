How can I obtain the body I want with IF/Keto and weight training?

<p>First off, anyone who is reading this that is on their Keto journey! KEEP IT UP! It has changed everything about my life for all the great reasons  and I hope it does for you too. For those who are considering joining  the journey, DO IT! You won‚Äôt regret it.</p>

<p>Anyway, I‚Äôm a 26 Male 5ft 9in (69in) starting weight was 225lbs(102kg) back in April of this year. Today, i&#39;m 179lbs(81kg) and hoping to reach 165lbs(74kg). Can&#39;t believe its happening so quick! </p>

<p>My question concerns weight lifting while on IF &amp; Keto. Ive starting 20/4 IF in April for a month then once I got adjusted I decided to do OMAD with Keto starting of May til this day. I DO NOT WORKOUT. I&#39;m active and always moving nowadays but I do not weightlift or do any cardio.</p>

<p>Although the weight is coming off fast, I feel like the muscle is too. I know it&#39;s because i&#39;m in a bad deficit. (Difficult hitting macros/calories with OMAD)</p>

<p>My daily calories is probably around 700-1100 calories a day majority of it being protein, less than 20g of carbs, and not that many fats (Sorry, i&#39;ll start counting my macros from now on)</p>

<p>I used the Ketogains calculator and it recommended me 165g of Protein, 20g of Carbs, and 125g of Fats and that I currently have a 22% Body Fat Percentage. </p>

<p>So because it&#39;s harder to hit my calories eating once a day I am considering going back to a 20/4 split with IF to make it easier to hit my macros/calories. </p>

<p>My MAIN goal is to get rid of as much body fat as I possibly can but still gain muscle. (I would really love to have abs and be tone/lean). How do I achieve this and is IF/Keto the right way for me? I plan to wake up at 6am every day and begin my workouts at 7am and break my fast around 5pm and eat in this window until 9pm. I have been eating towards the evening because I think it helps me sleep. So here are my questions!</p>

<p>1) Is my diet ok for this? Is 20/4 IF still going to be too far difficult to hit my macros and calories that were suggested by the calculator? Should I do a 16/8? or go back to a normal diet of Breakfast/Lunch/Dinner? Idk. I just want the results ASAP and i&#39;m willing to do just about anything. I want to be optimal.</p>

<p>2) The calculator recommended I used Isolate Whey Protein Powder and MCT powder/oils. Should I purchase this? and how do I go about using these supplements? </p>

<p>3) Should I change the time I break my fast to go along my new hobby of working out? Should I eat right after I workout? Or should I stick to the 5PM break? </p>

<p>4)  Is this workout routine optimal? I&#39;m planning to workout around 40mins-1hr a day. </p>

<p>Mon: Chest + Triceps</p>

<p>Tuesday: Back + Biceps</p>

<p>Wednesday: Abs + Shoulders</p>

<p>Thursday: Legs </p>

<p>Friday-Sunday: Rest (Is this too long of a resting period?) </p>

<p>Rinse &amp; Repeat </p>

<p>Thank you for being such an amazing community. I‚Äôve enjoyed reading everyone‚Äôs successes and tips here on the thread. KETO ON! </p>

<p>TLDR; Image above for reference (205lbs vs 179lbs). Losing the weight. But i&#39;m in a huge deficit. I want to be able to get lean/tone with abs. Confused if my training routine is ideal or not. Not sure about my macros and not sure about anything really. Need clarity and a sense of direction to move forward to make my family/girlfriend/myself proud.</p>

<div class="md"><p>First of all, Congrats on all your hard work so far! üëèüèº</p>

<p>1- Ketosis helps with fat loss as it gets your body to utilize fat for energy. 2- Fasting (especially 20+/OMAD/longer) helps to push body into autophagy for further rebuilding, repairing, detox, and pushing anti-inflammatory pathways. If your first main goal is to lose fat, continue with ketosis and fasting. If your second main goal is to gain muscle, you need to weight train to stimulate muscle growth. But one main question I have is how much muscle gain are you thinking? To get to being lean and toned or body building jacked? ‚Ä¶..It may be easier to just start with working out first to get the muscle growth going and THEN see what macro adjustments you need to make to help bulk/gain depending on your fitness/aesthetic goals. </p>

<p>Now‚Ä¶it‚Äôs not impossible to lose fat and bulk/gain muscle at the same time BUT it is much much harder. Tbh, if the after photo is you without weight training, I suspect you already have pretty decent muscle definition that is just insulated by fat. </p>

<p>Keep going! Best of luck!</p>

<div class="md"><p>Hey, thanks for the kind words and the response overall.<br/>
Very helpful stuff -- to answer your question i&#39;m not trying to get body builder jacked like The Rock but maybe a smaller scale Mike Chang HAHA.<br/>
I used to workout a lot when I was 20-22 (4 years ago) and since then I havent worked out at all due to Video games addiction up until 3-4 months ago where I said, &quot;that&#39;s it.. Ive had enough&quot;.</p>

<div class="md"><p>Your macros look good, but you should do what you can to get some protein in right after your workout. </p>

<p>I&#39;ve found that the easiest way to hit my macros is 1-2 protein shakes (two scoops each, one right after lifting) and one meal. You can take the MCT in your protein shake. You may also benefit from a creatine supplement. </p>

<p>Expect to drop weight more slowly and possibly even stall/gain initially. The introduction of strength training can cause water retention.</p>

<div class="md"><p>You have to be ready for a slowdown on scale and you‚Äôll probably want to eat more when you start lifting.</p>

<p>I have a similar journey; couple of months of keto (without IF) and have started lifting 3 weeks ago, with 5-7 kg left to lose. I haven‚Äôt seen much progress on scale since I started lifting (although I‚Äôm still eating in 300-500 kcal deficit) but I feel leaner. I feel like I‚Äôm going through body recomposition.</p>

<p>Be sure to eat enough protein.</p>
