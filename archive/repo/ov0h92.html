<div class="md"><p>Yea no... I guarantee you could find a gray area where people will disagree. If I just throw the weight up so that it hits its apex at the correct height, was it really &quot;lifted&quot; in the sense of a weight lift? Was it really lifted and held there if it only stays there for .1 seconds? What about 1 second?</p>

<p>What if I&#39;m walking forward as I lift? No? What if my feet just shift? Can my knee be bent this much? How about <em>this</em> much?</p>

<p>There&#39;s so many ways you could sort of cheat the system. I totally get why there are judges.</p>

<div class="md"><p>You have to get under the bar with locked elbows. They aren&#39;t allowed to bend at any point. They watch for that very carefully.

<div class="md"><p>The clean and jerk movement is defined as moving the weight from the floor to the overhead position in two strict movements. Pressing (like a shoulder press, bench press, or slow pushing) the weight from the front rack is then not permitted and is considered a missed lift. </p>

<p>In my book the first one counted but I&#39;m sure at the highest level they can see minute technical flaws i can&#39;t so.</p>

<div class="md"><p>It&#39;s not really like figure skating where your score is given by the judges, for lifting your score is based on how much you lift.  The judges are there to make sure the lift is done in proper form.  It&#39;s easier to lift a heavier weight if you don&#39;t hit full range of motion, use overly jerky moves, don&#39;t maintain a stable platform, etc.  The judges are there to make sure that the weight you properly lifted all your weight, not to score your performance.</p>

<div class="md"><p>Did you know that Kelloggs invented cornflakes as a deterant to masturbation, the flakes were placed inside the pyjamas at night, and if soggy in morning gave away the culprit.</p>

<p>But when Dr Kellogg realised how tasty they were when soggy he realised he could market it.</p>

<p>True Story!</p>

<p>Edit: lol thanks for the award, obviously Kellogg did NOT invent cornflakes as a jizz mop to help with midnight wank busting, and yes it was his brother who realised how popular their breakfast option was and went mainstream. He did NOT really put them in pyjamas, of course not... however that was how Frosties got their frosting.</p>

<p>Also the Rice Krispies campaign &quot;Snap, Crackle, Pop!&quot; got their idea from what Mrs Kellogg screamed at the point of orgasm.</p>

<div class="md"><p>That’s bull. Unless you ran a marathon after dinner or you didn’t eat after lunch the previous day, you have enough energy until lunch. I skip breakfast have a light lunch and eat a large meal for dinner and I feel great. I even go to the gym before dinner. Everyone is different. But also a big percentage of the adults are overweight and a significant portion is obese, modern humans eat too much energy trough out the day. Skipping breakfast might not be a bad thing for these people.</p>

<div class="md"><p>They actually did tests on that.</p>

<p>It was originally a test designed to study the power of positive thinking on athletic performance, but they divided the subjects up into three groups instead of just two. A control group that was supposed to exercise while maintaining neutral thoughts, a group that was supplied with positive motivation <em>(standard &quot;You can do it! You&#39;ve got this! One more!&quot; type stuff)</em>, and one that was motivated with negatives to induce spite <em>(&quot;That all you got? My mother can do better, and she&#39;s DEAD!&quot;)</em>.</p>

<p>The positive thinking group tested quite a bit better than the neutral one, but the group running on spite crushed them both.</p>

<div class="md"><p>It took leaving my cheating ex and showing her up everything she threw away to motivate me to lose weight. </p>

<p>We both went from ~160 to 315 (me) and 385 (her) over the course of our relationship. We were happy and got lazy desk jobs and watched movies and played video games and ate out for 7 years. We were what I thought was happy. </p>

<p>She had a coworker she wanted to have a threesome with (In exchange I could do the same with a woman) but I said no. Our sex life was prolific and pleasurable without needing additional help. Plus I was very monogamous. </p>

<p>Turns out, she only asked cause she felt guilty after she let him seduce her and she let him finger her in the break room at her job. </p>

<p>I immediately broke it off, evicted her from my house. And started to hate myself for trusting someone so much and letting myself go so badly because I thought I found my forevergirl and honestly, I stopped caring about myself. </p>

<p>Did a 180 and started working out 3 times a week walking at least a mile everyday, and cut all sugar and carbs out of my life. </p>

<p>Here I am 3 years later back down to 200lbs (still losing more and saving for a tuck) and more attuned to myself than I ever have been. </p>

<p>Meanwhile she moved in with her grandma and her new boyfriend after me both live off her grandmas social security and squat in her garage basically. </p>

<p>It’s a small vengeance, but it’s worth every drop of sweat it took to get here.</p>

<div class="md"><p>But it wasn&#39;t spite. He literally lifts a heavier weight in every subsequent attempt in every world championship he&#39;s been in. He even attempted 198kg in 2016 in Rio.</p>

<p>Also he&#39;s already the current world record holder for 198kg since 2019. So it&#39;s not like this is the first time he has done this. Spite would be to go for 199kg just for the heck of it and break his own record. Even more spite if he went to 200kg just to make it a nice round number.</p>

<p>People don’t appreciate how hard the lift is without lots of weight. It requires a lot of coordination, balance, your whole body in line and working together at once. To add on top of that so much weight is crazy.</p>

<div class="md"><p>Aye!</p>

<p>I used to do a fair amount of landscaping and quickly found the rake to be my favorite stretching tool. Later in the season I would switch to the shovel for a little added weight. Of course I would switch the direction of the tool to balance out the strain of the tools working ends weight. If you’re feeling extra frisky use a tamping tool to get the best of both words.</p>

<div class="md"><p>People who haven&#39;t lifted don&#39;t really understand how much 200kg weighs. Like it&#39;s a big number, but there is no real frame of reference. But after you go to a gym for a while and squat or deadlift something like 100kg or maybe even the 200kg after few years, you realize how fucking insane feat something like this is. </p>

<p>Like if you deadlift 200kg just over your knees with all your strength while shaking and feeling like your bursting all your blood vessels, your still a very strong guy by average standards and more than likely 20kg heavier than this guy. And then you look how effortlesly he cleans 200kg and then fucking overhead squats it, not even using split.</p>

<p>But no, testing didn&#39;t continue as normal. Please don&#39;t post obvious bullshit. They hardly tested in 2019, and only did half of that in 2020. And there were basically zero surprise tests. These are probably the most doped games since the invention of PED&#39;s.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Statistics provided by the World Anti-Doping Agency pointed to a steadily improving situation as the Olympics approached, but they do not mask the reality that over the entirety of 2020, there was a 45% reduction in testing around the world compared with 2019 — a non-Olympic year in which the numbers wouldn’t normally be as high anyway. In the first quarter of 2021, there was roughly a 20% reduction in overall testing compared with the same three months of 2019.</p>

<div class="md"><p>And the thing is, within weightlifting nobody has a problem with it. There&#39;s tested and untested leagues and everybody knows what that means. The shame and stigma and pearl clutching comes completely from outside, but the obvious reality is that if you want to achieve the peak of human performance, the same person is going to do enormously better on steroids vs off. It&#39;s regarded as a personal decision. </p>

<p>There&#39;s a popular youtube weightlifter named Clarence Kennedy who is an Irish unit that would have medaled at Rio, but couldn&#39;t go to the Olympics because &#39;his government wouldn&#39;t support him&#39;. Meaning the Irish government wouldn&#39;t do what literally everybody else does to protect their PED using athletes. I can&#39;t say for other sports but I think in strength sports, the top people in every one are absolutely using.</p>
