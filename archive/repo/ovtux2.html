<div class="md"><p>think it could just be genetics and u store fat more there instead of trying to get as lean as u can to get rid of them i would try tone ur obliques and get bigger wider lats to counter it.</p>

<p>I may not have the best solution and more experienced person may have a better answer for u but thats the best i got.</p>

<div class="md"><p>Why do you want to lose weight? You look quite slim already. I&#39;d focus on lifting more and growing muscle that you will start seeing through.</p>

<div class="md"><p>Solution 1: get even leaner. Would not recommend.</p>

<p>Solution 2: do a lean bulk and get bigger lats and chest. </p>

<p>I’d recommend solution 2.</p>

<div class="md"><p>I’d start at maintenance calories and work my way up to a 500 calories surplus over the course of a few weeks. I’d bulk for about 6 months focusing not on lifting heavy, but hypertrophy and feeling that muscle contract with each rep. </p>

<p>Once you put on some size, I’d go ahead and slowly cut back down doing a similar training regimen, just a 500 calories deficit.</p>

<div class="md"><p>I was the exact same body type as you and it took me dieting down to 5% bf before I saw the hips disappear completely. If I were you though, I’d heed the advice of many others here and just work on packing on muscle. Worry about the difficult areas when you’re ready to diet down for a serious show or something.</p>

<div class="md"><p>You’re pretty lean, I’d start packing muscle on with a surplus. You have no definition which creates the skinny fat look. If you started adding muscle you’d likely look more cut as long as your body fat isn’t increasing too fast.</p>
