Biohacks for strength ?

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Is there any information how someone smaller/Weaker can become stronger for example I&#39;m a woman who is training to be an electrician but it&#39;s been difficult to bend pipes the way the men can do it. </p>

<p>Is there any trick using physics or any type of martial art or similar technique that could make me physically stronger or better able to bend the pipe, perhaps by using momentum or wearing a weighted vest?</p>

<p>I want to discard the option of increasing my upper body  muscle mass because i dislike that aesthetic on me.</p>

<div class="md"><p>By exercising you will gain a lot of strength before you gain size. It&#39;s hard to grow muscle as a man with higher levels of testosterone. You won&#39;t get big unless you really want to and work hard at it.</p>

<div class="md"><p>lifting heavy weights is less hypertrophic than volume, which is to say, three reps closer to one rep max will increase muscle size less than 8 reps further from max. so lifting like that could help.</p>

<p>but also, just make sure you are using all mechanical advantage when bending (lengthen the moment arm, move the fulcrum farther from you, etc).</p>

<p>edit, if the pipes are standard sized you could design or have a designed a tool to attach for leverage. if a crowbar or tire iron fits inside, that would work.</p>

<div class="md"><p>Contrary to popular belief everything from 3 to 30 reps with 8.5-9RPE, long rest, proper form and no more then like 12 sets per week leads to similar hypertrophy and strength gains.</p>

<p>You can add some specificity, obviously, but lifting heavy doesn&#39;t mean you&#39;ll be able to use this strength in practical manner, nor does it mean that you&#39;ll be absolutely healthy from it.</p>

<p>We need lots of types of training to be healthy.</p>

<div class="md"><p>Yes there are pipe bending tools i can use them but once the pipe is larger in diameter it becomes harder as it requires me to use both weight and  strength to pull the lever back in order to bend the pipe. </p>

<p>And then it becomes even more difficult when creating an offset. Most men hold the tool in a way that they are pulling the lever down towards the ground. Because of my short height and lower weight i have found it difficult to pull it down towards the ground next to impossible when the pipe is 3/4 diameter.</p>

<p>The pipe is above my shoulders and it&#39;s hard to pull it down towards me</p>

<div class="md"><p>First of all, ‚Äúwoman who is training to be an electrician but it‚Äôs been difficult to bend pipes the way men can do it‚Äù is just a social construct. And definately not the best mindset for you to do this. Your biggest strenght lays in the brain! üòõ</p>

<p>I know nothing about tricks using physics / martial arts to gain strenght, but you can always hit the gym or do home exercises. Arm work can supplement your lifting, as well as help you gain muscle. Start <a href="https://www.wikihow.com/Build-Arm-Strength-Without-Equipment">here</a> and go further with researching on <a href="https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=3nPbqllIxzY">Youtube</a> / Reddit / <a href="https://blog.paleohacks.com/functional-arm-exercises/">blogs</a> for more references. </p>

<p>As for supplements, these can help you with boosting energy levels, increasing endurance, improving recovery times, building lean muscle, retaining muscle mass &amp; boosting protein synthesis. There‚Äôs no magic pill that‚Äôll make you lift pipes the next day.</p>

<div class="md"><p>No one said its a man&#39;s job</p>

<p>Men in general are stronger than women. If you are bending hard pipes at work, a stronger person can do it better than a weaker person or in this case the average man is better at bending a pipe better than the average woman can</p>

<div class="md"><p>The way I read your post, it‚Äôs a choice of (unnecessary) comparison. Speaking of, a lion has more strength than a hyena due to its size and different construction. That doesn‚Äôt make the hyena a less capable predator. Each has its own set of skills and techniques used for the activity. At the end of their hunt, both have their hunger satisfied. It‚Äôs the end result that matters. </p>

<p>I stand by what I previously said: real strength lays in the brain.  üí™</p>

<div class="md"><p>I‚Äôm honestly sorry for have offended you, that was not my intention at all. I was just suggesting to look at the situation with a clear mind, not taking into account what society thinks is best.
