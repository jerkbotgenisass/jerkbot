<div class="md"><p>I would enjoy your self but skips the carbs.</p>

<ul>
<li>Hamburgers and hotdogs? -skip the bun and ketchup</li>
<li>Beer time?- Say hello to Whiskey</li>
<li>Watermelon? - Jars of Pickles for that crisp yet soggy snack. </li>
<li>Smore&#39;s by the campfire? - Make another hotdog</li>
</ul>

<div class="md"><p>How good are you at sticking with things? For some of us, it’s comparable to an alcoholic falling off the wagon and then saying “I think I’ll just drink for the rest of the week and then stop next week.”</p>

<div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t need carbs to enjoy myself. What do you think you&#39;ll miss out on so much that it would prevent having fun?</p>

<p>I&#39;d probably not try to keep to a calorie deficit, but I&#39;d stick to my net carb goals, personally.</p>

<div class="md"><p>Well all my life I was used to eating whatever I wanted whenever . Pizza every night , soda , fries , chips , all day long . So I’m not used to veggies and some of the other keto foods . I found what I like and have been able to stick to it but ya I miss my junk food but I need to lose weight</p>

<div class="md"><p>So you think you need fries to have &quot;fun&quot;? You&#39;ve never in your life had &quot;fun&quot; when there wasn&#39;t a pizza around?</p>

<p>Sounds like there&#39;s a lot of urges and correlations in your brain that might need some untangling, in my opinion. You&#39;re never going to untangle it if you always &quot;feed&quot; that connection between food and &quot;fun&quot;, or food and &quot;friends&quot;, or food and &quot;doing what you want.&quot; </p>

<p>You can even have fun while you&#39;re completely fasted, in fact. I&#39;ve done it. It&#39;s actually kinda easy.</p>

<p>The sooner you experience having &quot;fun&quot; without entangling it with &quot;junk food,&quot; the sooner you&#39;re going to take control of your health and start making food choices instead of letting the food control you. I think this camping trip is a great chance to experience actual &quot;fun&quot; instead of only having fun if you&#39;re simultaneously eating junk food. You&#39;ll have lots of opportunities to distract yourself, because there will be so many better things to do than eat a pizza.</p>

<div class="md"><p>Beef jerky or beef sticks, nuts (or grab some eileens chocolate chips and make some trail mix), quests bars, diet soda and spirit of choice. Hell, there’s even keto bread/buns/ketchup if you want to have some burgers and brats. It’ll be easy to stay Keto if you plan your food and snacks beforehand!</p>
