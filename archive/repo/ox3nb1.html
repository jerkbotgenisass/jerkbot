Finding it hard to get to 2000 kcal without grains and dairy.

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Hi,<br/>
I have no idea how can I eat 2000 kcal a day without grains and dairy. I don&#39;t want to lose/gain weight. After counting calories it turns out that I would have to eat so much eggs and potatoes everyday just to make it up. I eat 400g/0.88lbs of meat and it usually has around 1000 kcal (including added lard). So I have to get the other 1000 kcal somehow. Veggies including potatoes are like 200-300 kcal max of what my stomach capacity is capable of. Having more than 5 eggs is also hard, and 5 eggs are about 400 kcal.<br/>
And it&#39;s still only after &quot;pushing&quot; myself to eat all of that food: 400g meat, potatoes, veggies, 5 eggs. I would have to it eat everyday just to get to the 2000kcal a day. I&#39;m starting to getting tired of it and also my poops got worse. I start to think it may be because of the meat because I eat almost same stuff everyday, but it&#39;s the only high calorie stuff available (ground beef and ground pork shoulder).<br/>
Butter (even ghee) is not an option.<br/>
I am a simple man and like simple meals, I don&#39;t like overdoing and making some &quot;fancy&quot; meals with 10 ingredients. But I think I need a variation. Maybe I should just be pouring 50ml of olive oil in every meal, eh.<br/>
I know nuts are high in calories, but I haven&#39;t been eating them for a long time and I am scared it will mess up my digestion even more.   </p>

<p>How do you guys do it? Eating 1-2 meals a day and getting up to 2000 kcal without ANY of the processed food.</p>

<div class="md"><p>Avocados. Sweet potatoes. Olive oil. I recently reintroduced nuts (walnuts and cashews) and they’ve not caused any discernible issues, and they’ve been great to keep my calories up. Artisana organics sells good tasting organic nut butters with no additives that I just eat straight out of the jar, you know, just like our Palaeolithic ancestors did.</p>

<div class="md"><p>It isn&#39;t hard to get 2000 calories.</p>

<ol>
<li>Choose fattier meet cuts. Ribeye&gt;sirloin&gt;fillet; chicken thighs&gt;breast; Pork ribs&gt;tenderloin.</li>
<li>Pick oily fish like sardines. Canned in olive oil for more calories. </li>
<li>Nuts and seeds are high calorie and generally well tolerated. If you are not sure about tolerating nuts, introduce them a little at a time. However, watch the omega-6 fat ratio.</li>
<li>Good tubers like potatoes, sweet potatoes, beets. </li>
<li>Plantains are good and easy to cook. </li>
<li>As others have said, avocados are great. </li>
<li>You can more oil to foods, but some consider oil to be a &quot;refined&quot; food, like refined sugar, and against the spirit of paleo. They say its better to get your oil from real foods rather than extracted and served on the side. Seems a little over the top to me. </li>
<li>Consider butter too. Not strictly paleo but most people don&#39;t have issues with it and it is great for flavor.</li>

<div class="md"><p>Thanks, I will try to apply to some of these points. But is 1000 calories from meat not enough? Because I already eat fatty ground beef/pork and to be honest I start to getting really sick of fatty meats.<br/>
Plantains unfortunately are not a thing in my country. 
When it comes to butter, I&#39;ve decided to ditch dairy all together, just to see how I feel. 
But thanks for other points. I definitely eat not enough fish. I also never had sweet potato so I will maybe give it a try. And I will try to reintroduce walnuts.<br/>
I&#39;ve also been thinking about dark chocolate, but I&#39;m not sure how &quot;paleo&quot; is that. Maybe drinking dark cocoa would be more &quot;natural&quot;.</p>

<div class="md"><p>Dark chocolate is good, but watch the sugar content. 80%+ is best. Its not strictly Paleo, but it seems that Paleo is becoming less strict in areas where evidence suggests that a food is more good than bad. And chocolate is a superfood. </p>

<p>The main downside of chocolate is added sugar and the calorie density. You don&#39;t care about the latter.</p>

<div class="md"><p>Leafy greens (spinach, kale, Swiss chard, dandelion, collards, etc.) shrink down massively when cooked, and have the added benefit of playing well with high fat ingredients like bacon, oil, ghee, coconut milk, cashew cream, etc. If a big leafy salad seems too voluminous for your appetite, try making creamed spinach with cashew cream, braised collards with bacon and lard, coconut curry kale, or other such saucy recipes- it’s much easier to eat 5 cups of greens in a sitting when they’re melted down to a single cup of creamy goodness.</p>

<div class="md"><p>Are you sure you need 2000 calories? </p>

<p>2000 calories is just a guideline for an &quot;average&quot; active man. What is an average man? Everybody is different. I am pretty &quot;average&quot; - 5&#39;9&quot;, 155lb, desk job. The only way I burn 2000 calories is with a decent level of exercise. I run 30+ miles a week and my weight is pretty stable. If I was on my feet all day or was 20, maybe I would burn more. </p>

<p>Your mileage will vary. If you haven&#39;t already, it would be good to track calories for a few weeks (myfitnessPal is good) before you decide that you need 2000 calories. </p>

<p>Evidence also suggests that a calorie deficit is better for overall health and longevity. So there is that too.</p>

<div class="md"><p>I know it was fashionable a few years ago to say that you don&#39;t need to watch calories on Paleo, don&#39;t weight yourself, trust the mirror etc, etc, but that doesn&#39;t work for a lot of people. People can get too fat or even too thin on Paleo. </p>

<p>I agree it is often taken too far, but it is easy to sabotage yourself and your goals on new foods if you don&#39;t educate yourself on nutrients and macros. There are good calories and bad calories, but they are all calories.   </p>

<p>Learning more about what you are eating is not a bad thing. And if you are going to last on Paleo, you need to learn about food and nutrition. So many people give up on Paleo when they don&#39;t lose weight on their diet of chicken wings.</p>

<div class="md"><p>As someone who was diagnosed as intolerant twice (different docs) I’d recommend testing that (yourself) I Always had bloating, gas, cramps, shit problems always around dairy. Cut it out for a while then tried raw milk and had no issues, I knew then it was something else, turned out something was outta whack with my gut. Did a whole “healing” protocol and I’m good now. I still do raw dairy mostly but nothing happens when I eat normal stuff either. </p>

<div class="md"><p>No problem; I don&#39;t do grains or dairy either. Good fats are essential and adding olive oil, coconut oil, avocado oil, tallow, lard, red palm oil on food or in shakes/smoothies/fat coffees can easily meet and exceed your caloric goals. Whole foods like nuts, nut butters, seeds, avocados, coconut, and fish pack a lot of fat too.</p>
