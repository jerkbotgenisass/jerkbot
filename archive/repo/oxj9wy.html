[Help] am I killing myself with this smoothie recipe I made?
<br/><strong>Posted by <a id="userlink" href="https://www.reddit.com/user/throawaystrump/">throawaystrump</a>. </strong><em>Posted at 2:47 UTC on August 4, 2021. 0 Points. </em><em>(self.<a id="selfLink" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/gainit/">gainit</a>)</em><em> (<a id="postpermalink" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/gainit/comments/oxj9wy/help_am_i_killing_myself_with_this_smoothie/">Permalink</a>)</em>
<div class="post">
<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><ul>
<li><p>Apple</p></li>
<li><p>Banana</p></li>
<li><p>100g peanut butter</p></li>
<li><p>100g oats</p></li>
<li><p>200g <a href="https://www.ms.is/vorur/vara/skyris-hreint-500-g">skyr</a></p></li>
<li><p>300g lactose free milk</p></li>
</ul>

<p>If I did all my calculations correctly this should amount to 1432 (76,8/60,9/136,6) as in calories (P/F/C). Now this thing tastes great, or at least more than passable and something I don&#39;t have a lot of trouble drinking. And then I fill in the rest of the calories with a bowl of spaghetti with ground beef which amounts to 1000 calories exactly actually, and then a banana. And I only drink water (not counting the smoothie of course). Now my question is, if I were to live off of this stuff, would that be dangerous? Assuming I eat a vegetable here and there, am I missing out on any big boy nutrients? I like the routine of only eating 1 or 2 meals that I know in and out, so this would help a lot in the bulking department if I didn&#39;t have to think any more about this stuff.</p>

<p>Because I&#39;m really fucking done with looking up the calories for this and that and using that piece of shit google calculator because I can&#39;t seem to find my old Casio one anywhere.</p>

<div class="md"><p>Lol I’m sitting here reading and noticing you’re downvotes like that’s so unnecessary to me. In my opinion do what you gotta do! I think your appetite will build over time. I’m very very underweight and I wonder the same things about these super high cal protein shakes hahaha, but I don’t think that’s sustainable. I think eventually your body will want real food. If you can try to go on amazon and purchase meal prep containers. They’re like $10 bucks. Bake a bunch of stuff and cook some stove top meals, and get your protein shakes for breakfast. We all gotta start somewhere. I don’t think you’re on a bad track.</p>

<div class="md"><p>my guy, if I can just drink a smoothie instead, I don&#39;t see any issue. If it makes you feel any better, I can drink half of it at one time and half of it later, which basically equates to two meals, but 1 meal prep (or like half a meal prep really, a nugget could probably do this recipe without breaking a sweat)</p>

<div class="md"><p>And now you turn it around, I swear Reddit comments just follow a script at this point. The answers I got didn&#39;t really address what I was actually asking, although admittedly I probably should&#39;ve made it 100% clear that I was asking about nutritional value and not the amount of meals, because one can change and the other will be something I do for the rest of my life. Fitness in my mind is supposed to be about indoctrinating a healthier lifestyle into your preexisting one, as opposed to just flipping the script as that isn&#39;t sustainable in my experience.</p>

<p>The answers you got were not about the number of meals. They were about not getting the majority of your nutrition from a smoothie. </p>

<div class="md"><p>I think the focus was definitely on the number of meals, or at least moreso than necessary. But from the answers I&#39;ve gotten I think keeping the smoothie is the right idea and I should varie the other meal and not just eat a plate of spaghetti every day. Obvious in hindsight but I was only really thinking about the smoothie for some reason when varying the dinner up makes a lot more sense.</p>

<div class="md"><p>okay honestly, why should that be an issue? Especially if you drink half of it before work and half of it after.

<div class="md"><p>Cool. Having over half of your calories come from some yogurt/milk/oat slop will likely result in some missing nutrients. Especially since there is a massive lack of vegetables in your plan.</p>

<p>I&#39;ll try to explain what I think you&#39;re missing: when people tell you that you &quot;need three meals a day,&quot; what they&#39;re really saying is that you should strive to consume a diverse set of micronutrients multiple times across the day in order to maintain the availability of those resources in your bloodstream at efficient levels, instead of concentrating them in a single spike from one big micronutrient-rich meal (in which case the excess may simply be excreted) or, worse, missing them entirely.</p>

<p>Unless your shake is comparable in composition to a product like (e.g.) Huel, then it shouldn&#39;t be considered a viable meal replacement.</p>

<p>Having said that, and bearing in mind the context of this sub, generally speaking <em>anything is better than nothing</em>.</p>

<div class="md"><p>is that like a daily award, or even hourly? Because if not, there is some stiff competition to contend with on this site.

<div class="md"><p>nah man, all these other responses were fine, maybe a lil too Reddity for my taste, but &quot;eating like an adult&quot; is crossing the line man, that shit ticks me off. Wtf does that even mean? As if that is a state of being that&#39;s completely binary and opposite of being a child. You mean like going to McDonalds three times a week or drinking protein shakes and eating chicken breasts every day? Because those are two adult activities that don&#39;t really feel very similar. If you grow up your whole life eating one meal per day, how many meals do you think you&#39;ll eat once you&#39;re an adult? Those things have literally nothing to do with eachother my guy.</p>
