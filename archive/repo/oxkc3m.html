<div class="md"><p>It is pretty uncomfortable to start, but that gets better over time. I’ve found it’s pretty helpful for lifting things in real life, but that’s about it. I do them because they don’t hurt my hips and I can load them quite a bit heavier than a goblet squat.</p>

<div class="md"><p>For sure. It&#39;s kind of a halfway house, and a really useful intermediate if you&#39;re going for moderate to high reps where the Zercher might become unpleasant. The other good side of it is that it forces you into a good squat pattern through the arc of the bar.</p>

<div class="md"><p>Honestly compared to most demos of this your form is pretty good, you actually fight to get it neutral at the bottom prior to coming up. It does come apart as you go in terms of being a squat, but it still doesn&#39;t round too bad. </p>

<p>Might want to try really leaning back at the bottom and pulling your shoulders back, drive through your heels, lead with your chest. Might even be helpful to do this as a separate assistance lift/technique builder. Once you start going up a little off it only gets worse as you go. Stay on it!</p>

<div class="md"><p>Yeah and I don’t want to do that. Started doing them because they didn’t hurt my hips, unlike back squatting</p>

<p>You are basically lifting with your lower back on the way up.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Why is this a problem? Your lower back is meant to be used for lifting, particularly if you&#39;re carrying weight in front of you.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Listen its your back man, multiple people have said it looks dangerous, myself included.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I expect most of the people who say this have never performed a zercher squat in their life and have no idea what they&#39;re talking about, yourself included.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Take it from someone with back pain man, it&#39;s really not fun, and a lot of times there&#39;s no going back.  You do you, but it just doesn&#39;t look like it&#39;s worth the risk to me.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Maybe you should have strengthened your back more so you didn&#39;t get lower back pain...</p>

<div class="md"><p>Started doing Zercher squats last year as a way to try and load the legs that didn’t bother my hips. Traditional squats would leave my hips joints aching, and for all of my 20’s I just dealt with it. </p>

<p>I knew I could goblet squat without hip pain, but goblet squats are severely limited on total load. So, one day I was messing around in the gym with squat variations that best mimicked a goblet squat and landed on zerchers. </p>

<p>I started training zerchers with a similar protocol to how I trained squats. I would work up to a top single, then do 4-6 sets of back offs. This protocol allowed me to go from 305 to 375 in an 8 month span. </p>

<p>I’ve found that zerchers hit my quads more than back squats, allow me to use more weight it than front squats, and don’t hurt my hips like either squat variation. For me, they are the Goldilocks of squats.</p>

<p>If you can get past the forearm pain, I suggest elbow sleeves, Zercher squats can be a great alternative to front and back squats.</p>

<div class="md"><p>It’s got a little “good morning” action out of the bottom, but it’s a clean as I can do a limit attempt. Most of training is 70-80% of this weight where I can stay more upright.</p>
