<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I need help with this because I&#39;m currently very thin for my height. I&#39;m 5&#39;11.5 and weight around 141 pounds. I still fall in the normal BMI, but I&#39;m not happy with the way I look. I like the idea of intermittent fasting as it has a lot of health benefits, not just losing weight. I&#39;m wondering if i can put on mass while follow a 16:8 window, and if it works. If anyone has any info, please share it with me. If you have done this yourself, please enlighten me on the process you took to achieve gains while intermittent fasting. Thank you...</p>

<div class="md"><p>16:8 is possible. I tried 20:4 for awhile and just couldn’t put down enough calories to maintain. Only possible if I’m eating carbs. </p>

<p>I’d just recommend eating to meet your macros, especially if you’re trying to out on weight. If you can do it in 8 hours great. If not, I don’t think the benefits of IF outweighs the potential</p>

<div class="md"><p>Depends on where you are at also. I got to a pretty amazing physique on 16:8, but when I wanted to get more massive and move into advanced strength levels I found it made a mugger difference in getting progress beyond where I was stalling when I stopped doing IF and Keto</p>

<div class="md"><p><strong>cliché warning</strong>
Every body is different (and everybody).</p>

<p>In order to to gain (assuming you’re asking for lean muscle), you need to put muscles in time under tension either using heavy weight, slow &amp; controlled reps, low rep ranges, or lighter weight, higher rep ranges. You also need to be in a calorie surplus (above maintenance, look up a BMR calculator online for a rough estimate of your maintenance then add 3-8%) with enough protein intake (approx. 0.6-1.0g per lb of body weight daily).</p>

<p>That’s the generic answer. Intermittent fasting, keto, etc. is all irrelevant as long as the above criteria are being met… in most cases.</p>

<p>YOUR body might react differently and be more efficient with different adjustments. Depending on how efficient you want to be, you need to guess and check accordingly. YOUR lifestyle (free time, preferences, dietary restrictions, etc.) needs to be factored in as well:
- Do you work out best on a full/empty stomach? Can you adjust your meal times to maximize how you feel good in the gym?
- What kind of exercise do you enjoy (weights? Cardio? Body weight workouts)? Can you adjust your workout to create more time under tension?
- After a few weeks trying something, how do you feel? Are you seeing results? Remember getting into ketosis? You can’t rely on a few days to know how your body will adjust to a change.</p>

<p>At the end of the day, if you want to cut fat, lean bulk, gain weight, or whatever, you WILL hit a point where you need to make the goal the priority. Whatever (ultimately trivial) dietary restrictions you’ve chosen won’t matter if your body is not seeing the desired changes.</p>

<p>If it works, don’t fix it. It may take a little time to know if it works. When it stops working, fix it until it works again.</p>

<p>Hope this helps! Ask any questions if you got them.</p>

<p>PS: Mandatory self-love reminder. As long as you’re healthy and feel good, that’s the most anyone can ask for. Beyond that is our ego talking, and it’s nice to indulge it, but it’s not the end all be all. &lt;3</p>

<p>EDIT: Grammar and some spelling.</p>

<div class="md"><p>Yes, if you like really big meals. If over a week your average calorie input is over maintenance that should work. I tried it, I literally couldn&#39;t stomach such big meals.</p>

<div class="md"><p>When I was doing OMAD keto I hit a wall at 1200 calories and simply could not stomach the 1800 I was targeting. Soooo much food at once when you aren’t eating carbs. Off keto I can definitely down a 4000 calorie plate of pasta.</p>

<div class="md"><p>Yeah exactly, it&#39;s the point of keto: long lasting energy with (comparatively) little food. On the other hand a high carb diet is good for athletes who need peak energy at certain times of the day. I&#39;ve seen people do high carb for bulk, keto for cutting. It worked well for them, but I don&#39;t feel like completely changing my eating habits several times a year.</p>

<div class="md"><p>Ok, I feel the need to clarify a few misconceptions in the above:
1. Please don’t cycle on/off keto, that’s incredibly taxing on your liver and definitely not sustainable for any length of time.
2. Fat is definitely more calorie dense (9cal/1g) vs protein and carbs (4cal/1g) so you can definitely eat less food by volume on keto. The problem is satiation. Fatty foods are more satiating so it feels harder to eat more of it. You can eat very filling low volume meals off carbs as well (potatoes, oats, rice).</p>

<p>At the end of the day, listen to your body and don’t rely on any 1 blanket answer.</p>

<div class="md"><p>You are trying to gain weight by not eating.</p>

<p>Sounds pretty silly, right?</p>

<p>When your goal and method of achievement work directly opposed to one another, you probably need to take a moment and reassess what truly is most important to you and what would be the most efficient way to achieve what you want.</p>

<p>Can it be done?  Sure.  Is it the most effective way to bulk?  Absolutely not.</p>

<p>There have been many pre/post keto bulk photos posted here with skinny guys and they show pretty gimped results amounting to a whole lot of wasted time and effort that could have been better spent doing something else for greater results in less time.  But to each their own.  There is no wrong way.  Just better ways and worse ways.</p>

<p>That&#39;s hardly &#39;not eating.&#39; You don&#39;t have to eat every few hours to put on weight. That&#39;s bro science from the &#39;80s. A good rule of thumb is to appeal of evolution. People in the past would have been pretty ripped. We can tell because of stress on muscle attachment points in human remains. People today are undeveloped. People back then all had great muscle tone. They were <em>not</em> eating every day, much less 3 times per day. They put on muscle just fine simply from the motions they had to go through to get and process food, clean, etc. They weren&#39;t lifting weights, sure, but they were taxing their muscles in a similar way overall. </p>

<p>A lot depends on his genetics, too. But he&#39;s not proposing something crazy like rolling 48s or something. I think you&#39;re overthinking it a bit.</p>
