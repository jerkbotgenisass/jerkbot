Seeing my dad go down a bad rabbit hole.

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Hello, my dad is an actor in Mexico and as a result, been taking his workouts and training more seriously. His trainer and others are at the gym are recommending to him crazy expensive supplements. Right now his most expensive is a $300 testosterone booster which I know is a scam. </p>

<p>I have a feeling that he doesn’t realize that the movie star physique is extremely hard to achieve at his age (51) without taking PED’s. His diet isn’t too extreme quite yet but I do see him being extremely disappointed in himself because he really does believe that all movie stars gain their muscles naturally. </p>

<p>I’m kinda scared for him to be introduced to them and think of them as magical. I don’t know how to approach him about it. So I want to ask, what encouraged you guys to get fit without drugs. I wanna maybe see if I can make a case for it and stave off this path I’m seeing him go down.</p>

<div class="md"><p>This might sound weird but he might be better of using trt, especially since he is above 50 years of age. That would be cheaper and more effective. Btw: trt js not a bad rabbit hole.</p>

<div class="md"><p>He absolutely would be better off on TRT. As long as he goes to the doctor and it’s properly doses and correctly done there is 0 shame in that at all. It will probably improve multiple parts of his life.</p>

<div class="md"><p>He needs to wake up. Even at 51 with peds. He’s not gonna build his dream physique. He should meet with his doctor to get blood work done, and get on a healthy dose of TRT. At his age his body could use it. </p>

<p>Then get away from snake trainers selling you fake supplements.</p>

<div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t know how you prove this to him. Maybe find some credible sources online and show them to him?</p>

<p>The only legal supplement that&#39;s going to make any meaningful difference is creatine and its dirt cheap. Everything else is either barely effective, an actual PED, or pure snake oil. Do you know what he&#39;s actually taking? I imagine pharmaceuticals aren&#39;t extremely regulated in Mexico, and I imagine there&#39;s a possibility its actually a PED, which is also not a great scenario without doctor supervision.</p>
