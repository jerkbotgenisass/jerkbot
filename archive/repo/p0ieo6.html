<p>Some guy was wrong about the milk nutritional value, so I corrected him gently. Later he said I was right and thanked me for the correction, but before that, <a href="/u/WeaponizedSleep">u/WeaponizedSleep</a> came to expose how dumb he is, saying that I shouldn&#39;t correct the other guy if I don&#39;t know how &quot;oz&quot; system works. The information was clearly wrong, no matter if I know how &quot;oz&quot; system works or if I don&#39;t, so just here he show how dumb he is. I still reply him gently, and then he says that cringy caps shit, and for more cringe it is a lie as I didn&#39;t did or said that lol, so as here he showed he is retarded I told him that he ks. Then he Perma ban me. Lmao, I already knew he was ban baiting me so I don&#39;t give a crap about the ban. I just don&#39;t understand how a mod of a subreddit can have that attitude towards the member of the community that did nothing more than correct a clear wrong information in a respectful way, and even the corrected one thanked me lol.</p>

<p>Also, obviously the first post is corrected, at first he said a 16 oz glass of milk was 300 calories and 8 gr protein so it&#39;s obviously that the information is wrong I don&#39;t need to know how the oz system works for see it is wrong.</p>

<div class="md"><p>Yes maybe it&#39;s my bad for not giving full context. Yes, the other guy edited the comment, after thanked me, but the comment of the mod was before that, so he came with that shit when I just gently corrected some wrong information.</p>

<p>It is more like he did a cryban, but ok. I already knew he was ban baiting me, and as I don&#39;t give a shit about getting banned in a subreddit, I told him the truth.</p>

<p>How you speak is at least as important as what you’re saying. </p>

<p>The kind of person who casually throws out “retarded AF” the moment they aren’t treated with kid gloves isn’t the kind of person we need on Gainit. </p>

<div class="md"><p>I didn&#39;t even noticed he edited the comment. But as I suppose it was after he thanked me, if I am not wrong you posted your comment before he thanked me, or atleast I remember opening your comment before his reply. So I think you saw it before edit, and there also was his reply telling me thanks for correcting it. But, I give you the benefit of the doubt, maybe this was all just a misunderstanding.</p>

<p>And it isn&#39;t true, I didn&#39;t jumped straight to &quot;retarded AF&quot;, I replied respectfully one time and after after you disrespect me with that cringe caps shit it&#39;s when I noticed you were retarded AF/acted like one lol and had to told you because it amazed me that it was a mod who were acting that way.</p>

<p>Were you saying the ratio of protein to calories was wrong at first? And since it was the ratio, the volume didn&#39;t matter? It looks like maybe the other dude edited.</p>

<div class="md"><p>Hey, you are the one that told the dumb mod he missed the point. Yeah, the other guy obviously corrected the information. At first he said 16 oz was 300 calories and 8 gr protein.

<p>I actually didn&#39;t read the exchange at that point. I was just being silly with units.</p>

<p>Probably not a great approach to call people &quot;retarded&quot;. You&#39;ll end up banned from many subs like that.</p>

<p>cryban</p>

<p>I could be off base here, but I&#39;m pretty sure he just clicks a button and the never thinks about you again. He certainly wouldn&#39;t make a post about it.</p>
