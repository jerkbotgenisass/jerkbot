<div class="md"><p>Yeah, his channel was by far my favorite. No bullshit, just simple &quot;here&#39;s an exercise for a muscle group you might enjoy, here&#39;s where you might fit into your schedule&quot; vids.</p>

<p>He <em>supposedly</em> argued for lower dosage for his clients, but either didn&#39;t apply it to himself or just lied. Then he revealed that he had a history of heart disease with his parents having major issues(even dying?) in their 40s, yet he&#39;s been blasting for 25 years, that&#39;s when i realized that no matter how sane and knowledgable bodybuilder looks all these guys are fucked in the head with dyspmorphia and will kill themselves for gains. Had  a heart attack and just kept pushing and using again like a week later...</p>

<div class="md"><p>non-gear related...my mom died at 44 (when I was 15) of a heart attack and my dad has battled heart disease a lot of his life (no heart attacks or anything, he keeps things under control). She was an alcoholic, smoker, and was on prescription meds. bad combo. I lived a smoke free, drug free, and alcohol free life till I was about 32 because of this. I&#39;m by far the healthiest one in my family (internally and externally). I started drinking alcohol (very limited) when I was 32 till now (40) just because I felt it would be fine...and it has been. I didn&#39;t get my mom&#39;s alcohol dependent gene. So it frustrates me when I hear of people following bad habits in their parent&#39;s footsteps despite witnessing the damage those footsteps caused. I never wanted to be that way.</p>

<div class="md"><p>I mean our entire lives, everyone has said that steroids are bad for your health. They all do the same cycle. It starts with them having a complete body transformation in 3 months and blaming it on hard work, eating chicken, not fapping, and amino acids. Then they have some drama. They get a fight with a friend that gets way overblown or they assault a cop or something. (Actually happened to a friend of mine when he started juicing) then they have all these health problems and blame it on bad genetics or a family history. Then they finally admit they&#39;ve been juicing their whole life. Then they die young.</p>
