<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Hello,</p>

<p>As most of you know there’s been a massive wave of new trt users, some can equate this to YouTube &amp; IG, others just because of age. Young or old I believe preventive care &amp; trt should be an option for us younger men.</p>

<p>I’ve been on trt for 2 years now, both ugl &amp; clinic prescribed. My frustration is with the current medical communities unwillingness to work with us younger males in optimizing our hormones yet are willing to prescribe biological females who plan to transition to psuedo men(sorry I don’t know the lingo) 10-30x their baseline testosterone levels. If you were to prescribe a male 10-30x his amount he would identify as GIGACHAD. They deem one medically necessary and the other anabolic abuse.</p>

<p>Frankly it seems like sexual discrimination, I really think the bodybuilding community &amp; trt community need to step up and advocate for themselves so we can get trt &amp; labs freely prescribed without judgement.</p>

<p>Our doctors give out birth control (progestins) to 16 year old girls and shut down their t without telling them nor supplementing it, yet they will give an ftmf testosterone therapy 10-30x their baseline at age 16 also. This is malpractice. If what they have is gender dysphoria, then I should be able to be prescribed t for my body dysphoria.</p>

<div class="md"><p>When I was 21 (16 years ago) I suspected low T and I told my doctor. He replied that &quot;maybe you&#39;re just gay&quot;. That&#39;s how educated some doctors are on these matters. Finally after a decade of going to various doctors about this issue, I decided to just go to a men&#39;s health clinic and it has been the best decision I&#39;ve ever made.</p>

<div class="md"><p>That&#39;s a little bit too much. What I want is to live in a world where health professionals are able to assess and treat their patients with intelligence and nuance, look beyond one or two numbers on blood tests, and provide quality care for their patients according to what they need. You can&#39;t just blanket give everyone who shows up testosterone because in fact in some cases the symptoms might be caused by other things, what I don&#39;t want is that a dumb doctor decides that we can&#39;t be helped by testosterone based solely on the range on the bloody paper and shut out people without any amount of analysis.</p>

<div class="md"><p>It&#39;s not just testosterone that has this bizzaroworld standard of regulation.</p>

<p>As the biological females on <a href="/r/menopause">r/menopause</a> will attest, it&#39;s much harder for a female to get replacement estrogen prescribed by the Dr than it is for a male to get it because he feels he was born in the wrong body.</p>

<p>We had to go through countless doctors to get one to prescribe estrogen to my wife when she had have a hysterectomy because of uterine cancer. In the end she got it from my TRT doc.</p>

<div class="md"><p>When my endo cut me to 60mg a week for testing in the mid 700s I left and found a doctor who actually specialized in transgenders to get me back up to 100mg.  I told her that I felt like low T 5 out of 7 days on 60mg and was able to get my prescription bumped back up.  Eventually had to leave that doctor too because she didn&#39;t know shit about hcg.  Found a great urologist that let&#39;s me have whatever I ask for (within reason).  Got TRT, HCG, and AI scripts with insurance flipping the bill mostly.</p>

<div class="md"><p>You’re disregarding the whole point, sure you can pay for play at clinics; but 90% of them are just t mills who don’t actually look out for your health and just want to milk you for every dollar (which I don’t have an issue with) I also never said there’s a conspiracy to keep our t low, I just think that they should use the same logic that they use to treat trannies to treat us, because quite frankly it makes no sense.</p>

<p>How is giving a biological female 10-20x her baseline safer than giving a real male 1-1.5x his natural levels, all the while monitoring his health the same way they do trannies?</p>

<div class="md"><p>I agree that the system is broken, but you should blame insurance companies who make billions in profits and fight to pay out claims. Most doctors are trying to help their patients, and many are underinformed.</p>

<p>I am not knowledgeable enough to say how easy it is for transgender people to transition. But I don&#39;t think I&#39;d trade with them, and what they do doesn&#39;t affect me.</p>

<div class="md"><p>I’m not saying to take away their treatment, I’m saying Atleast give us the same. </p>

<p>I am just using them as an example, by that I mean they get adequate care with hormones and have no proper biological use for the extra t so why can’t we?</p>

<div class="md"><p>Its sort of off-putting how some people on this sub tends to use the transgender community as a punching bag.  Even more so when its coming from someone who has healthy T levels, and then wonders why their doctor won&#39;t prescribe lifelong T treatment for them.</p>

<p>Yes, there are many folks on here with T at the <em>very</em> bottom of normal who are unfairly told that their T levels are &quot;fine&quot; (I was one of those people).  But taking it out on the transgender community and their treatment isn&#39;t the right tact to take.</p>

<div class="md"><p>If that&#39;s what you actually think transgenderism is, then the issue is your lack of knowledge, not the medical treatment of transgender people.
