<div class="md"><p>Congrats on a PR lift my dude, but lemme just say something. You need to fix your form ASAP. Itâ€™s all over the place and you have multiple issues that need correcting.</p>

<p>Please drop the weight, focus on improving form, then go up in higher weight as your form progresses. Otherwise you wonâ€™t get much further than this.</p>

<div class="md"><p>Correct me if Iâ€™m wrong, but it seems that the deadlift is really easy to get a big PR for 1RM, good form or not. If itâ€™s way too much you get immediate feedback from your back. But a bit too much, you can still make the lift itâ€™s just sloppy. It convinces people itâ€™s a proper PR based on pure brute strength. But itâ€™s really a thinking manâ€™s lift and this shows it.</p>

<p>I imagine his problems with form were minor, but maxing the weight exaggerated all the problems. Itâ€™s not a real PR without proper form. Sorry, OP.</p>

<div class="md"><p>It&#39;s a PR regardless of the form. The only rules you need to meet in order for the lift to class as a rep in powerlifting is:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The bar cannot travel downward before reaching the final position</p>
</blockquote>

<p>You must stand erect with the shoulders back</p>

<p>You must stand with your knees straight at the completion of the lift</p>

<p>You cannot have the bar rest on the thighs during the lift</p>

<p>You cannot step forward or back or move the feet laterally during the â€˜up phaseâ€™</p>

<p>You must return the bar to the floor while maintaining control with both hands</p>

<p>Not saying that OP&#39;s form isn&#39;t shit as it is, just pointing out that form has fuck all to do with if it counts as a PR/Rep, as long as it meets the rules the ref will give you the green light.</p>
