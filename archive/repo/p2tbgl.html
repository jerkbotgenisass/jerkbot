<div class="post">
<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Sup. I&#39;m back into gaining weight. Starting at 152lbs. Headed for 200lbs in January 2022 (8lbs per month) I&#39;m 6ft tall and 29 years old.</p>

<p>I&#39;ve been 140 and I&#39;ve been 195. Every time I fall off the bandwagon, I find it easier and more fun to gain.</p>

<p>Here&#39;s my current regimine for gaining good weight.</p>

<p><strong>Breakfast: 1,185 kcals ($5.50)</strong></p>

<p>Egg shake (blend it): 860 calories</p>

<p>-6 raw pasture-raised eggs ($2.50)</p>

<p>-2 cups pasture-raised whole milk ($1.25)</p>

<p>-2 tbsp raw organic honey ($0.50)</p>

<p>-dash of cinnamon</p>

<p>I also have 16oz of orange juice and a banana when I wake up which is 325 calories ($1.65)</p>

<p><strong>Lunch: 1,120 kcals ($9.60)</strong></p>

<p>-8oz sirloin steak ($5.50)</p>

<p>-4oz fresh mozzarella ($2.20)</p>

<p>-0.5oz Amish butter to cook the steak and pour over meal ($0.15)</p>

<p>-2 cups pasture-raised whole milk ($1.25)</p>

<p>-2 tbsp raw organic honey ($0.50)</p>

<p><strong>Dinner: 1,040 kcals ($7.50)</strong></p>

<p>-8oz calf liver ($3)</p>

<p>-4oz fresh mozzarella ($2.20)</p>

<p>-0.5oz Amish butter to cook the steak and pour over meal ($0.15)</p>

<p>-2oz salsa ($0.25)</p>

<p>-24oz orange juice ($1.90)</p>

<p><strong>Total for the day:</strong>
<strong>3,345 kcals ($23)</strong></p>

<p><em>Please note that eating liver isn&#39;t recommended by Dr. Who Knows but I&#39;m cool with it for now because it&#39;s loaded with vitamins. I&#39;ll switch to eating that once or twice per week soon. Yes it tastes good cooked with butter and seasoned. I also drench it with salsa.</em></p>

<p>Edit: I&#39;ll be adding more fruits and veggies soon.</p>

<div class="md"><p>At least for me, eating and cooking vegetables is very hard. I have never liked them and can barely stomach eating them. I know they are good for you and should be the number 1 option but I find it hard to either  find the time too cook them and if I do I can never stick with them on a diet. I have a multivitamin because I know I need the micronutrients at the very least. Also my poops have never been normal.</p>

Roasted broccoli: wash broccoli, throw on oiled sheet pan, sprinkle salt and pepper, roast in oven at 450 F for about 12-15 min. Crisp, crunchy, and tasty.<br/>

<p>Your breakfast sounds gruesome, your lunch sounds great. Liver is ok IMO, not sure about every day. Hella good for iron!</p>

<div class="md"><p>No doubt! Breakfast is delicious. Tastes like honey cake with milk, and it&#39;s quick to make/drink. Lunch is always my favorite man, can&#39;t beat steak. </p>

<p>But yeah definitely adding more carbs (fruits and veggies). I tend to stay away from starches. From my research I don&#39;t think just eating veggies/fruits = healthy. I&#39;ll be adding carrots, berries, and spinach everyday.</p>

<div class="md"><p>$23 a day for food? That seems high my dude (or gal or person).</p>

<p>I seem to be referencing the Vertical Diet a lot lately, but it&#39;s just so simple!</p>

<p>Take a basic meal like the &quot;Monster Mash&quot; - </p>

<ul>
<li>12 oz ground beef</li>
<li>2-2.5 cups of cooked white rice</li>
<li>1 cup chicken stock</li>
</ul>

<p>Eat like a 1/2 cup of some veggies with a couple meals.</p>

<p><em>(I do like a half pound - so 8 oz - rather than 12 oz because it&#39;s easier to eyeball the when splitting packages.)</em></p>

<p>It costs me about $4.00/lb for lean ground beef and I can get a 20 lb bag of white rice (with 1 cup servings totaling about 50 servings) for $12.00. Chicken stock is like $2.00 for six 1 cup servings... so this all totals out to:</p>

<p>&quot;Monster Mash&quot;</p>

<ul>
<li>8 oz ground beef ($2)</li>
<li>1 cup dry rice ($0.24)</li>
<li>1 cup chicken stock ($0.33)</li>
<li>Total cost : $2.57 per meal</li>
<li>Total calories: 460+640+10 = 1,110 </li>
</ul>

<p>If I have 4-5 meals a day, that&#39;s $10-13 and 4400-5500 calories a day!</p>

<p>Add in drinking some milk, having some veggies and maybe a bit of OJ post workout, easy money there.</p>

<p>Is it boring? Oh hell yea - just like Wendler&#39;s Boring But Big programming. It&#39;s <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dePHQqjRKoo">super effective</a> and doesn&#39;t require a huge grocery list or much preparation.</p>

<div class="md"><p>Thanks for sharing! My focus is on food quality and not price, but if I can get some quality ground beef I might do steak less often to cut costs. I don&#39;t mind boring, plus beef rice and veggies is delicious. I&#39;ll have to see what my nutritionist says and go from there. Congrats on the gains bro.</p>
