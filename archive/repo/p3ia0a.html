	<title>Metabolism peaks at age one and tanks after 60, study finds. The study, of 6,400 people, from eight days old up to age 95, in 29 countries, suggests the metabolism remains "rock solid" throughout mid-life. It peaks at the age of one, is stable from 20 to 60 and then inexorably declines.</title>

<div class="md"><p>From looking at the actual journal article, “tank” is a gross overstatement. Metabolism appears to decline after age 60, but at -0.7 +/- 1% per year, so error bars larger than estimated drop. The change between 1 and 20 is -2.8 +/- 0.1% per year, for comparison.</p>

<div class="md"><p>Thank you for explaining this. I am age 66 and the headline did not seem right to me as I am very active and I don&#39;t feel that much different from when I was 40. Your interpretation makes more sense to me and aligns with what I am seeing among my friends. I joined a hiking club and a lot of our members are 80+ and they still go on the hikes. There is good life to be lived after 60 if you are careful and lucky.</p>

<div class="md"><p>Yah, metabolism decline in adulthood and middle age is pretty much just decline in physical activity causing a decline in muscle mass. And decline in muscle mass (if not accompanied by a decline in calorie intake) causes an increase in body fat, which is an endocrine system organ and can affect hormones. </p>

<p>Sedentary lifestyle also causes biomechanical problems like stiffness, back problems, joint problems, etc. Sometimes people do movements or lift weights (like in moving homes) that they used to be able to handle, but hurt themselves because they&#39;ve lost so much muscle tone, too. Oh and falls - a lot of those are related to losing mass in your glute muscles.</p>

<div class="md"><p>I&#39;m not sure about that, I think it&#39;s more important to just have an activity level high enough to burn all the calories you are consuming, whatever that may be. Swimming, chopping wood, high intensity calisthenic day-long orgies, the point is that you have to enjoy it enough that it feels more like a lifestyle than a workout.

<div class="md"><p>I thought I was feeling old In my 30s and then it got worse and worse and it turned out my thyroid was tanking because my body decided to destroy it like a virus so I didnt have enough thyroid hormone anymore (Hashimotos Hypothyroidism). And everything in your body relies on thyroid hormone so even a little less can make some people feel just awful. Now that I&#39;m on the right dose of replacement thyroid hormone I have more energy than I&#39;ve had for years. I&#39;d say to anyone who thinks they just feel old to see a doctor, do some research and advocate for yourself- don&#39;t get brushed off. It&#39;s not normal to feel like you&#39;re in your 80s in your 30s even if you are busy. My husband&#39;s grandmother had a lot more energy and got more done than I did and she&#39;s 50 years older than I am and was caring for her husband with Alzheimer&#39;s. So yeah, don&#39;t give up trying to feel better, even if it is hard when you&#39;re that tired and feeling bad. </p>

<p>Thyroid problems do often show themselves in the 30s to 50s and people think the weight gain and aches and all that is normal but it&#39;s not, it&#39;s your body struggling and needing help, so listen in case it&#39;s that or something else. A lot of damage can be prevented, both mentally and physically with good care and being proactive.</p>

<div class="md"><p>Unfortunately for some, it is a decline after 35.  I wish it wasn&#39;t so. Got diagnosed with osteoarthritis around then, and then had two herniated discs at 37. I was very active before. Working out was part of my job. My metabolism might be the same technically but because I can&#39;t do what I used to do without relying on pain medication is very hard to maintain the same metabolism. Taking things like hydromorphone to manage pain isn&#39;t fun. </p>

<p>When I ask why it was happening to me, physio and doctors all just tell me if happens when we aren&#39;t young anymore.</p>

<div class="md"><p>Oh sure, that is why I but in &quot;drastic&quot;</p>

<p>You notice that straightforward &quot;verbal and numerical abilities&quot; stay fairly consistent.  (and verbal increases for quite a while)</p>

<p>Perceptual speed (is that knowing how fast you are are going? Memory and Spatial reasoning decline.  Of course aging is a real thing, but other factors such as not driving any more due to eye sight may affect perceptual speed, or the limiting of certain tasks can affect others.</p>

<p>Memory always seems like a consistent decline, but this is highly influenced by lifestyle factors that accumulate over time.</p>

<p>So for sure many declines happen when aging, but how many of them are solely due to aging?</p>

<p>More scratchy than metal bars, often risky with long stretches up to higher branches and with branches not being strong enough to support weight. Also the ground isn&#39;t necessarily soft to fall on like monkey bars in the sand.</p>

<p>When I was little we had this metal cube thing at school, one side with a ladder and the opposite without, like a goalpost, with another bar in the middle and some monkey bars across. You could do all sorts with it, but the best was to climb up the ladder side, reach out to the bar in the middle then swing out and try to jump and catch the goalpost bar. Some kids were able to swing again, flip around and jump back, and forth. I was not one of those kids, I never made it to the goalpost bar and one time landed hard on my stomach in the sand, and I completely winded myself.</p>

<p>It was awesome. There&#39;s nothing as cool as that for adults.</p>

<p>Also, and <strong><em>seriously</em></strong>, no one has proper Super Soakers anymore. That one is simply because Hasbro is evil, though.</p>

<p>I can feel the difference in my metabolism now compared to when I was 18. That difference is much bigger for some of my similarly aged friends, less so for others.

<div class="md"><p>I can&#39;t remember the exact link - but there was another study that tied metabolism to muscle mass and body composition.</p>

<p>So if you keep your body type up, you&#39;ll be able to keep eating. But go sedentary and lose muscle and bone density, and you&#39;ll need less energy to maintain that now non-existent tissue: so you get a metabolism drop.</p>

<p>It just so happens that as we age it gets harder to maintain that mass, added to the fact that with the more wealth you earn, the easier it is to become sedentary.</p>

The triathlete&#39;s legs were almost identical in composition - a strong muscle with a thin line of fat.  The sedentary man&#39;s leg was almost pure fat, with only a little bit of muscle.  The outer circumference of the legs of all three men was fairly similar, but the composition was night and day in difference. </p>

<div class="md"><p>It&#39;s red meat that is the worst, and I&#39;m dubious about the numbers provided. In places like Brazil, they are removing forest to raise cattle, which is bad, however up the North American prairies, it&#39;s natural ruminant habitat - if the cattle weren&#39;t there, the bison, goats, and many other wild ruminant species would be.</p>

<p>What I want to know is why no fuss is being made about the fact we&#39;re going to be out of phosphorus in the 60-80 years. Seems to me like not being able to grow anything should be a bigger deal.</p>

<p>I&#39;m not sure if this is strictly true from a biological sense. I have seen people in their 70s maintain their strength. I&#39;ve gotten stronger into middle age than when I was younger too. </p>

<p>Cartilage tissue doesn&#39;t self repair (see: Arthritis), so mobility gets hurt a lot if we aren&#39;t careful. and small injuries when young become weeks out of the gym as we age.  </p>

<p>But yeah - I&#39;m not sure how much harder it gets to build muscle. I imagine still a decent amount though, what with dropping Testosterone levels and increased cellular damage. (See: Cancer rates vs age)</p>

Adipose tissue is now considered an endocrine organ and excess fat can throw off your hormone balance. So it can be a bit chicken vs egg.

Really, the finding is that from 20-60, there is no really noticeable change in metabolism, then sometime after that, it does start to decline, but at a maximum of 1% per year. For a person starting at 2000 calories, that difference is walking for 10-15 minutes, or eating 3 fewer almonds per day.</p>

<div class="md"><p>Every year as metabolism decreases, naturally the percentage of a lower metabolism is itself lower, so it&#39;s not quite 200 calories by 70. Based on the highest estimate for the steepest part of the drop in your life on 2000 calories, 20 is the maximum ever. I would suspect that with nearly everything else that changes with age; the slope, or the percentage itself, lowers and levels off as well. </p>

<p>Also, I have nothing to back this up but I will note that this is also around the age where musculature atrophies to a reasonable amount, so this could be a cause. If you continue strength training throughout your life I would have to guess that you could severely lessen or almost negate the losses.</p>

<div class="md"><p>I think part of this is the myth that you&#39;re &quot;eating for two&quot;. In reality you should continue eating your normal diet for the first 6 months of your pregnancy and eat an extra 200-ish calories per day (so like, an apple and some almond milk) for the last trimester. (<a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/health-40698876">I&#39;m basing this on UK government health data, from the NHS</a>) The US health figures that I&#39;ve seen - up to 500 extra calories per day, the whole way through - seem excessive and likely to lead to unneccessary weight gain which can be tough for mothers to shed postpartum. For example, the <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/reproductivehealth/maternalinfanthealth/pregnancy-weight-gain.htm">US&#39; CDC says you should gain 25 - 35lbs</a> during pregnancy while the <a href="https://www.nhs.uk/pregnancy/related-conditions/common-symptoms/weight-gain/">UK&#39;s NHS says you should gain 22 - 26 lbs</a>.</p>

<p>It really is just an additional small snack per day. Your baby basically has the caloric intake of a mouse until it starts getting beefy in month 7.</p>

<div class="md"><p>That’s very true too. Depends on the kids and the parents. For every parent I’ve known that’s constantly on their feet, often literally chasing their child just to keep them from killing themselves, there’s another parent that’s barely moves at all. Between lack of sleep, wild hormones, screaming children, etc. parents can feel exhausted and assume they’re getting more exercise than they actually are.</p>

<p>A lot of people vastly overestimate the amount they move throughout the day. People also tend to vastly underestimate the amount of calories they consume.</p>

<div class="md"><p>For weight loss, yes. For the slow weight gain many adults see? Not quite the same.</p>

<p>Lots of young adults are extremely active and can burn 1000+ calories a day, often more, especially when they’re involved with sports. Given a combination of growing, gaining muscle, and upkeep, they’ll eat far more calories than their resting metabolism will use up.</p>

<p>A lot of high school and college athletes get burnt out, and stop said activity after graduation. Thing is, for people who’ve always just eaten when hungry, that doesn’t work out so well, because their diet won’t stop as abruptly either. A year or two of relative inactivity can mean a huge amount of weight gain if someone isn’t careful.</p>

<p>But yes, exercise will also just generally improve your metabolism by building muscle too, given the increased caloric needs to maintain said muscle.</p>

<div class="md"><p>Yeah, this is exactly what I meant. It comes down to calorie intake, obviously, but those excess calories often stem from the fact that people don’t adjust their diets as their lifestyles change.</p>

<p>They’ll blame it on their metabolism, remembering the good ol’ days of college when they could eat an entire pizza in one sitting, and drink every night without gaining weight… whole forgetting that they spent 3 hours every afternoon swimming or playing football.

<div class="md"><p>No, it doesn’t magically make you fat. But over the course of years, it absolutely can.</p>

<p>And yes, if you’re still working out and lifting, you won’t face the same issue. That was my point. Many adults spent their youth working out, playing sports, running around, etc.- and then find themselves working an office job. They might still exercise a little, but maybe not. And people honestly might not realize the weight gain until it’s completely obvious. Or they might notice, but not realize the extent until they’re 40 pounds heavier than they were 5 years ago.</p>

<p>People get used to routines. They get used to how much and when they eat, they get used to being able to eat whatever they want, because they played enough sports they couldn’t eat enough as it was. Mindsets like that can be really hard to break out of, and by the time it’s an obvious problem it’s become hard to change.</p>

<p>Even 100 extra calories a day can lead to 10 pounds over the course of a year. It doesn’t take much to sneak up on you if you aren’t careful. That can often be the real difficulty- serious, former athletes will sometimes get fat very quickly after they stop, just due to the sheer amount of calories they always needed to consume. On the flip side, someone who used to jog in college might find themselves slowly jogging less and less after they graduate. They’re still active, but not nearly as much, and it keeps tapering down. If they don’t adjust their diet, it adds up. </p>

<p>Portion control makes a huge difference, and empty calories through drinks are a terrible issue for a lot of people. But even two oreos is 120 calories- a small dessert, that doesn’t seem like a big deal, can add up if you’re suddenly moving 100 calories less a day than you used to.</p>

<div class="md"><p>Yeah! Thank you for saying this! Exercise AND proper diet! A runner doesn&#39;t actively burn fat until they&#39;ve reached marathon distances (slow oxidative muscle fibers). Up until then our bodies will replace the energy we burn with what we eat, so we need a caloric deficit to lose weight (the diet part).</p>

<p>The human body is very, VERY good at adapting. But it won&#39;t do it until it needs to. Runners become better runners, swimmers become better swimmers, and starvation/inactivity causes muscle breakdown before fat because muscle burns calories and our bodies are very well evolved to store fat in times of starvation.</p>

<p>Try telling our muscles to gear up because we have a weight-lifting competition but we stopped working out every time at the gym when it felt uncomfortable. Our bodies had no idea they needed to change because we never gave them the circumstances to think they needed to</p>

<div class="md"><p>Yep. While in the end, your caloric intake is going to be what makes or breaks your ability to have abs, exercise is still an important component of weight loss (but more importantly, general health.)</p>

<p>Humans evolved as active creatures, constantly moving. Fat, like you said, evolved as a storage for times of starvation. Even at rest, muscles burn more calories than the same weight of fat does… so if you’re not using said muscles, your body views them as a burden. It’s also why smaller deficit diets tend to result in much less muscle loss too- smaller deficits allow your body to adapt over time, but this also means much slower weight loss. Large deficits can essentially trigger starvation mode if you aren’t careful, so while you may lose weight fast, you also risk losing much more fat.</p>

<p>I’ve always viewed it as a pantry; muscles are the perishables foods. Fruits, veggies, bread, etc. Use it or lose it. If you don’t eat it within a certain time frame, it goes bad. Fat is the canned and non-perishable goods. It’s not going bad anytime soon, so while you’ll use cans, noodles, etc. up, you’ll also generally have a store of various things just in case.</p>

<div class="md"><p>It&#39;s a slow build up. If you used to spend time hanging out with your buddies outside, then you&#39;re doing quite a bit of moving around, possibly burning a 100-ish extra calories in the day. </p>

<p>While being older and a parent can be draining, really you&#39;re spending more time standing around, supervising. That 100 fewer calories a day translates into an extra lb of weight in a month, and about ten lbs in a year. </p>

<p>There are other factors too though, not everyone gains weight that quickly. For example a teenager or university student often has a full engaging day which doesn&#39;t involve being in close proximity to a refrigerator. 
A stay at home parent or an office worker often has a pretty dull day with snacks in easy reach. And so boredom grazing kicks in. </p>

<p>And how does a young person unwind in the evening? Go hang with their buddies, immerse themselves in a computer game?
How does a working adult unwind? TV and a beer, maybe order takeaway cos dinner was 4 hours ago. </p>

<p>Over time it all stacks up. I&#39;m laying it out all very simplistically, but you can see how it becomes an issue. As someone approaching middle age, I find it quite amazing to see all the expanding waistlines, but for those people I know very well, I can see it&#39;s nothing to with metabolism and everything to do with poor eating habits.</p>

<div class="md"><p>That certainly contributes, but its not the sole reason. You can be overweight while eating whole, fresh foods, just like you can be fit while eating processed foods (or even underweight.) It just comes down to calories, and like you said, processed food is very calorie rich. </p>

<p>Processed food is fine in moderation, and great for high calorie snacks or treats. They just also tend to be less filling than their calorie count would lead you to believe, so it’s easy to overeat. One nicely seasoned, roasted chicken breast is essentially equivalent to 4-5 oreos, while being vastly more filling.</p>

<p>If you’re trying to lose weight though, I’d agree avoiding as much processed food as possible will help. Lots of hidden calories, whereas if you’re eating fresh fruits, veggies, and cooking your own meat it can honestly be hard to overindulge in the same was you can with processed options.</p>

<div class="md"><p>Nope, I’m aware how little most exercise burns. I think you’re underestimating how little it takes to gain weight, which is more what I was talking about.</p>

<p>Even 100 extra calories a day of over the course of a year can mean gaining up to 10 pounds. Granted, most people don’t have static diets, and will have days where they eat right, days they don’t eat enough, and days where they overindulge. But for many people that have had active lifestyles, who then join the white collar, stationary life, </p>

<p>A lot of adults don’t see the weight gain happen immediately- it’s over the course of years, and they’ll often fluctuate in that amount of time. And it often stems from eating the same way they always have, without realizing they’re no longer active enough for said diet.</p>

<p>I’d also add that even at rest, muscles need twice the calories that fat does, pound for pound. Having more muscles means you need more calories to stay at maintenance.</p>

<p>Obviously if you’re trying to lose weight, and are trying to do so by burning off calories while you eat a container of oreos every night, you’re going to have a terrible time. For most people, burning 200-300 calories a day with moderate exercise, even just walking is easily achievable, and can go a long way. Just track your macros, and track your steps/exercise. Exercise is more like a bonus, and shouldn’t be what you rely on for the weight loss.</p>

<div class="md"><p>I think the vast majority of the time exercise is not the culprit. It’s calorie intake, and gaining a larger and larger appetite due to eating a little more than usual. It snowballs and eventually to feel satiated you need far more calories than required to maintain.</p>

<div class="md"><p>It’s not the exercise itself that’s the culprit, but it often stems from people going from an active lifestyle to a stationary one. It’s obviously all calorie intake, but most people get in the habit of eating a certain way, and don’t realize that their body won’t magically adapt to their now stagnant lifestyle.</p>

<p>Even the appetite can stem from that- you’re used to needing a certain amount of calories to maintain your weight… and have an appetite for that amount of food. Suddenly being less active doesn’t usually make that go away. Your appetite might taper some, but unless you actively adjust your diet your body is going to just try to continue what it was doing… which means you may blink a few years later and wonder what the hell happened to your waistline.</p>

<p>There’s not often a lot of education regarding proper diets and exercise, and how calories “work.” Lots of adults have no idea how to count them, or how many are burned by exercise, nor do they know how to account for their maintenance weight and calorie intake. All they know is that they used to be in great shape during high school or college, and they ate constant junk food… so why are they gaining weight now? What they forget is how much they used to exercise (often combined with the increase caloric needs for a growing body), and that while they may eat less now, they’re not burning any excess at all. So that “lesser” amount of calories is still more than they need to maintain.</p>

<p>I have never seen someone who is overweight and actually put in REAL effort into losing weight not lose weight. And I don&#39;t mean fad diets. I mean making life style changes.

<div class="md"><p>I had a month where I had very little to do for work and was basically stranded on a military base in the middle of nowhere without a kitchen and no way to go get food out in town.  I literally ate nothing but chocolate milk and fast food.  Pizza Hut, Charlie’s, Subway, Burger King, etc.</p>

<p>I eat a fairly high-protein diet as a matter of preference so take that for what it’s worth (I was getting ~0.8g of protein pound of bodyweight).  But outside of that I was eating fast food every day, multiple times a day.  Thing is, I was counting calories and eating at a deficit.  </p>

<p>By the end of the month I was the leanest I’ve ever been (and possibly will ever be).  Obviously if I had eaten straight sugar on a deficit things would have been different.  But that would have also been miserable.  </p>

<p>Point is this: Macro nutrient ratio is important, and getting micronutrients (vitamins and minerals) is important too, but when it comes to weight, eating fewer calories than you use is king.</p>

<p>Same with calories and weight gain. You can eat very poorly and still &quot;lose weight&quot; if you maintain a calorie deficit. By contrast, you absolutely cannot lose weight if you &quot;eat healthy&quot; but maintain a calorie surplus. Calories are the single most-important factor for weight loss. </p>

<p>Eating &quot;healthy&quot; is relevant, but is not as important as calories. You&#39;re making a different point, but it does nothing to detract from the role calories play in weight loss.</p>

<p>So 200 raw greens vs 200 sugar is the same weight wise, but completely different in terms of satiety and likelihood that you&#39;ll stay in a deficit that day. Plus sugar is way worse on your body&#39;s insulin management.</p>

<p>Nutrition is complicated and there are a lot of variables, some that can be controlled for and some that can&#39;t. Anecdotally in my own life, I used to have the kind of metabolism where I could eat more than enough burgers and ice cream alone to meet my micronutrient requirements and still not gain weight. As I grow older and my metabolism has slowed down, I have had to deliberately choose more nutritious foods so that I can lower my caloric intake without fatigue and illness setting in.

<p>What it comes down to is the effects of hunger and nutrition on the body and brain. It&#39;s actually pretty fascinating the differences between people and their eating habits and what the body experiences for hunger. </p>

<div class="md"><p>I thought there were some assumptions made around things like Dietary fiber where we report a lower energy level to cover the inability to extract nutrients.</p>

<p>But yeah, the USDA number likely represents a reasonable upper-bound on the calories it&#39;s possible to extract from a given food item. I just haven&#39;t been able to find much data on the 4-4-9 rule and how much variation there can be from person to person.</p>

<p>On the other side, so much of your &quot;out&quot; calories depend on your basal metabolic rate. We know that has a huge variation from person to person, and that people who have more muscle mass are likely to have a higher BMR. (and it&#39;s going to be harder to build muscle mass if you get your calories mostly from sugar)</p>

<p>My parent comment was about the idea that you can overeat, but be malnourished in key nutrients. So I don&#39;t really understand why people only care about weight/fat on here. Being malnourished will effect your mental health, your immune system, your recovery from stress, your skin.... the list goes on and on. You better watch out to get the best nutritional profile in your food you can get! Your body and mind will thank you in the long run!</p>

<p>To your number question. Be patient I&#39;m sure there are lots of studies in the making. A quick look on google scholar showed that insulin plays a <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0168822711700146">massive role</a>.</p>

<div class="md"><p>Except that the change from 20 to 40 isn’t usually that people are eating more. It’s that they are exercising less. Yes in the short term if you want to lose a great deal of weight it is most efficient to control diet. Especially for previously sedentary people, it takes a lot of exercise time to generate a significant caloric deficit that will lead to quick results. </p>

<p>But the weight gain comes from years and years of a very slight calorie surplus. Maybe as little as 50 kcal a day. That is the equivalent of a short walk in which case you absolutely could outrun your diet with exercise. The slight reduction in activity as people get older and less active is absolutely responsible. If anything, people I know eat more responsibly as they get older and the booze and pizza binges on weekends become less frequent.</p>

<div class="md"><p>Basically, yes.  I&#39;m honestly glad these kinds of factual statements are starting to be acceptable, backed up with proper scientific studies.  It seems so obvious, but far too often dangerous narratives get pushed that lead individuals to believe genetics are more to blame.  At that point, they adopt the &quot;I can&#39;t change my genetics so why even try&quot; mentality, which is just a horrible thing for someone to believe, or to be taught. Our bodies are machines, with calculable thermodynamic inputs and outputs.  More in that out equals weight gain. Keeping a 200lb muscular body heated to 98.6 degrees requires more energy (calories) than keeping a 150lb body heated to the same temperature. If people start to think this way, they can more easily achieve the goals they want. Exercise burns calories, but so does being muscular - it&#39;s a positive feedback loop for losing weight and staying healthy.</p>

<div class="md"><p>We really need to get rid of this ideology. It is true from a physics perspective but completely ignores the complexities of nutrition and physiological science.</p>

<p>If you body has a defect that prevents or makes fat utilization difficult for energy your body is always starving.</p>

<p>Think about it, if you sit down for a meal and eat 800 calories your body uses about 70 to 100 calories in the next hour naturally, but the other 700 are stored for the rest of the day. If your body can&#39;t utilize those calories well and release them, then you end up super hungry again, and you end up needing to eat all the time and you end up massively overweight. This is caused by many diseases including thyroid issues, diabetes, etc. that cause people to be overweight.</p>

<p>Boiling it down to calories in and calories out makes you look uneducated.</p>

<p>It&#39;s literally thermodynamics. You&#39;re talking about some 1 in a 1,000,000 case that truly has fucked up health issues that make them not adhere to laws of physics.</p>

<p>You can&#39;t gain weight if you run on a caloric deficit. And you will gain weight if you have a caloric surplus.</p>

<p>Whether or not you &quot;feel&quot; hungry, when your body isn&#39;t actually starving is quite irrelevant.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>If your body can&#39;t utilize those calories well and release them</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Can you point to something factual that proves this happens. (consistently, and not in an extremely rare case)</p>

<blockquote>
<p>then you end up super hungry again</p>
</blockquote>

<p>hungry =/= starving</p>

<p>Yes, you will feel hungry, but there&#39;s nothing wrong with feeling hungry.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>and you end up needing to eat all the time and you end up massively overweight.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>You don&#39;t &quot;need&quot; to eat, and that&#39;s basic lack of control.</p>

<p>If your body can&#39;t access the calories for some reason, eating more food is somehow going to change that?</p>

<p>If you can only utilise 100 calories and the rest are &quot;stored&quot; for later, then just eat 100 calories. Eating more at that point serves no purpose but to make you &quot;feel&quot; better. If the hypothetical 700 calories are stored for later, then that be it. You will feel hungry, but your body won&#39;t suffer, because you&#39;re not actually starving, since you have the energy reserves that will be used later.</p>

<p>All of that sounds like massive coping.
Yes, fat loss isn&#39;t easy, no one said it was. But everyone can do it, due to simple laws of physics.</p>

<div class="md"><p>You sound like you have a very poor understanding of the body.</p>

<p>This isn&#39;t rare at all, it is called Type 2 diabetes and millions of people have it. It is a metabolic disease where people cannot access their bodies energy stores, which causes fatal drops in blood glucose because they can&#39;t convert fat into blood glucose and blood glucose into fat without medication.</p>

<p>Managing their metabolism requires taking external hormones that allow their body to have normal metabolism.</p>

<p>You also seem to completely miss the point that it isn&#39;t about laws of physics. They aren&#39;t violated, but a biological system has multiple forms of energy storage and use, and those systems can become broken and no longer function. This can cause death, such as in untreated diabetes, the organs literally starve and fail and shut down, even though the body has plenty of energy stores / calories on it.</p>

<div class="md"><p>Of course you can lose weight and get healthier with proper control of the disease through medication. The point is that it is a metabolic disease that interferes in the flow of energy from fat to glucose and glucose to fat, and therefore your body can starve and die, even with plenty of energy on board if it is untreated. This is well documented.</p>

<p>With a good diet, and medication, proper management of diabetes is possible. Before medication fixed the metabolic issues in the 1950s or so diabetes was a death sentence.</p>

Also I just had nerve ablation for pain.</p>

<div class="md"><p>It would be interesting to weigh this research against the studies looking at age-related declines in cellular NAD reducing mitochondrial efficiency.</p>

<div class="md"><p>Yeah I think also mitochondrial membrane integrity and free radical leakage/damage could be partly behind this</p>

<div class="md"><p>Probably, although it’s incredibly difficult to assign causality to any one particular factor. Metabolism is a very robust system, and usually the true precipitating factor of metabolic decline is not easy to track down. Science has know for decades that redox metabolism, free radical generation, etc. becomes mis-regulated in disease, but the question of how to intervene is difficult to answer. There’s a balance between senescence and proliferation that must be maintained, which is why cancer and degenerative diseases are seemingly two sides of a coin.</p>

<div class="md"><p>People often ignore NEAT which are the calories you burn by just &quot;moving around&quot; a lot. I live in NYC  where we have to walk everywhere and you do not see obese people. I&#39;m sure they exist but you can go weeks and weeks without seeing a really large obese person. </p>

<p>Walking to the subway; going up and down stairs; walking to the grocery store and restaurants. It makes a huge difference.</p>

<p>Funny thing is my family lives in the Midwest. They will drive to places that are less distance than I have to walk in NYC. But it&#39;s easy to just sit and never move.</p>

<div class="md"><p>That&#39;s basically the obesity statistic. Midwest states being sprawling suburbia and rural encourage sednitary lifestyles and shortcuts like cars. Meanwhile coastal areas are far more population dense with more opportunities for energy expenditure as daily course of life.</p>

<div class="md"><p>I’m in Chicago and i tell friends and family from other states that a location may be a 20 minute walk from where I live and they gasp saying that I need a car. </p>

<p>Living in a city has been way better for my health. I bike and walk everywhere except during the winter. It was strange last year before the vaccines rolled out when my partner and I both gained 7-12ish lbs from sitting around all day with nowhere to go but the grocery store.</p>
