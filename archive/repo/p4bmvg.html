Eating in a large surplus without fat gain

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>A bit of a long-winded post, but I am a low-20s male with a 3-year history of yo-yo dieting, getting underweight and then bingeing. My last “cycle” took me from 7% to 40+%bf, which has taken me over a year to lose through a combination of keto, fasting, and PSMF. I’m currently sitting at around 11-12%. Since Ive never reverse dieted, my metabolism has been sluggish for all of these years (hypothyroid and less than 80 total testosterone when I was previously underweight).</p>

<p>The thing is, I’ve been practicing maintaining with carnivore before losing the last few vanity pounds, and Ive had many consecutive days where I’m eating 4000+ calories (Im 5’6” without much muscle). My weight hasn’t changed significantly and certain areas like my arms and hands have been becoming more vascular. I usually just get very hot after eating.</p>

<p>Is it possible that I am gaining fat, but it’s visceral and thus not noticeable? It just feels strange to eat so much and not blow up like I did in the past when rebounding and bingeing on carbs. Surely even with hormonal up-regulation, fat would still accumulate.</p>
