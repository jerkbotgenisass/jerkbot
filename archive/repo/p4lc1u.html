<p>Long time reader first time poster. There are a lot of suspects around my anytime fitness (and I&#39;m sure many others) that could make this board. First one I&#39;d like to present is this particular mutant. </p>

<p>This guy though: He loves taking over the squat rack for full body workouts. notice his phone occupying the flat bench. He also had his water bottle on there. The only time he took them off was to do dumbbell presses in the squat rack. </p>

<p>My first time being introduced to this fella, he hooks a resistance band to the j-cup to do curls I&#39;ll be sure to film it, for it is the most offense form of curling in the squat rack. I honestly wish I could film his whole workout, it&#39;s pretty amazing. He has gone through entire resistance band and dumbbell routines in the squat rack with a packed gym full of people during peak hours with no situational awareness. It&#39;s astounding.</p>

<div class="md"><p>Ya if you were so interested you&#39;d find out yourself. I googled it to make sure I wasn&#39;t wrong in replying with sarcasm the way I did. And I am somewhat wrong in that lateral refers to the lateral head of the deltoid that&#39;s being worked not so much a note of it&#39;s trajectory.</p>

<p>If you were smart and knew what the fuck you were talking about you could have corrected me.</p>

<p>But your wrong as shit and want to just try to point out other people&#39;s incorrectness vs doing minimal research into what your insinuating is not correct. No need to back pedal 1000 watt. Just don&#39;t get that pencil neck broken trying to stick your head up your own ass.</p>

<div class="md"><p>If you took a moment to Google &quot;lat raise&quot; you would see that yes, that is common shorthand for lateral deltoid raises. Which literally just describes the trajectory, muscle targeted and movement being done. </p>

<p>But a search engine inquiry? Nah it&#39;s 2021 I&#39;ll just reply like an ignorant ass 5 year. And maybe the information will be bestowed upon me. Blessed be thy Fortnite.</p>

<p>If someone says lets do lat raises, are you confused as to what they are asking of you? If so, your probably curling in the squat rack a bit yourself.</p>

<div class="md"><p>Haha. Wow. Just a question, yikes.
Because I watched the video and was looking for someone working their lats. This bro needs to chill, thought the same thing, &quot;lat&quot; to me means latissimus dorsi not lateral deltoid.</p>

<div class="md"><p>Tbh I was confused before I pulled up the image. I agree with the others that when you see &quot;lat&quot; it&#39;s almost always a shorthand for back, but I understood where it came from. Still no need to be rude, tbh.

<div class="md"><p>So what do you call it? You say &quot;lateral deltoid raise&quot; Everytime you would discuss this exercise? What about Y-raises and front plate raises? It&#39;s contextual but if your talking about upper body raises I don&#39;t think there is much debate that it&#39;s likely targeting the delts.</p>

<p>I like being a little rude when people ask questions they could answer with a quick Google search. Or honestly you can type it into Instagram, twitter, wherever the hell you want and you&#39;ll see this exercise. I get it some people go to school and learn whatever the fuck they learn, but when someone says they&#39;re supersetting lat raises and db presses are you seriously going to act confused?</p>

<div class="md"><p>I would also say that the main difference between the lat pulldown and a lat raise as far as the name is that a pulldown doesn&#39;t need LAT as a qualifier. A pulldown machine works the lats, period. A raise (not calf raises tho) works the delts, period. but when targeting specific regions, ie lat or front the prefix is added.</p>

<p>If you say Pulldown, I understand it is working the lats because that&#39;s what 99.9% of pulldowns do, brohamskawitz. Unless of course you have no idea what your talking about...🤨</p>

<div class="md"><p>Just because you&#39;re writing paragraph responses to a simple question, I&#39;ll bite:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Lat pulldown literally refers to the lat.</p></li>
<li><p>Curls are not necessarily biceps.</p></li>
<li><p>Press doesn&#39;t just mean shoulder press (actually you alluded to this is another response, bench press, etc.)</p></li>
</ul>

<p>At this point it&#39;s semantics, and I swear I wasn&#39;t being sarcastic when asking if &quot;lat raise&quot; means &quot;lateral (deltoid) raise,&quot; yet clearly it offended you, and for that I apologize.</p>

<div class="md"><p>You asked if it&#39;s common. A quick Google search. YouTube search. Instagram search. Twitter search. Will show the same exercise if you search for lat raise. You can look up pulldown and you will get lat pulldowns. Because the muscle group doesn&#39;t dictate the name of the exercise.</p>

<p>Do you really refer to lateral deltoid raises without shortening it? Do you also do horizontal bench pectoral presses. I&#39;m asking because most exercises arnt referred to commonly so specifically. Saying a preacher curl is pretty obvious I&#39;m doing biceps and not hamstring curls. I don&#39;t have to say seated hammer preacher curls unless I want to sound kind of retarded.</p>

<p>I&#39;m not offended but I don&#39;t mind pushing back on general obtuseness.  I spend time researching shit when I don&#39;t know before asking if possible. Your question seemed steeped in smugness and obtuseness. I don&#39;t mind correcting people at the expense of being an asshole there are a lot of people not correcting others, in th gym, and that&#39;s how you end up with people who think it&#39;s alright to not rerack there weights.</p>

<div class="md"><p>So by Googling &quot;lat raises&quot; and &quot;lateral raises&quot; appears, that makes it obvious that saying &quot;lat raises&quot; is a common abbreviation of &quot;lateral raises?&quot;</p>

<div class="md"><p>I guess I shouldn&#39;t be surprised that a reddit subthread making fun of the hokey shit people do in the gym is populated largely by people who don&#39;t go to the gym or know what exercises are called. Color me surprised.</p>

<div class="md"><p>Thank you. I&#39;m not trying to tell people what&#39;s what but if you don&#39;t know what a lat raise is and wanna know, it takes almost no time. </p>

<p>Or argue with me, where you&#39;ll still be incorrect but i&#39;ll talk mad shit.</p>
