I'm starting to believe that "higher" rep training is genetical

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>For months now I&#39;m struggling to increase my bodyweight ring pull ups to hit at least 3x8, but it seems impossible. I get so tired for the third set that I can only hit 5-6 reps, after that I do 3 additional sets with 4-5 reps only. So in total I can do ~34 bodyweight reps in 6 sets if I do 8 reps in the first 2 sets.</p>

<p>Few weeks ago I tried weighted pull ups in the lower rep ranges and I could do 3x6 with +8kg additional weight and after that 2x6 + 1x5 bodyweight. In total this was 35 reps. I stopped doing them weighted because I got bored carrying water bottles to the place where I train.</p>

<p>Is it possible that some people just can&#39;t train in the &quot;higher&quot; rep ranges or does it have something to do with breathing, grip strength, is it neurological or what? Should I stop chasing reps and train them weighted?</p>
