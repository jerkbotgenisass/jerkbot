<p>Ya know what, why don&#39;t we just &quot;freeze&quot; your membership for 2 months instead. Its a small fee and I can do it right here.</p>

If they had any reason or hope to have modern aspirations like other young people their age it wouldn&#39;t need to be this way.  Half of them look like they would switch sides if you would give them a job and let them see a big city.  I imagine most of these guys are born into this by now yes?  Between the soviets and the US, they have been fighting for 3-5 generations, it must be similar to a gang in the US, where if you are born on the wrong street you don&#39;t have a choice.</p>

<p>I think when it comes to mass ideologies like the Third Reich and the Taliban, the vast majority are a product of their surroundings.

<div class="md"><p>And that is why they are not people like me, because I did opt out and I had to walk away from my family to do so.

You are right, many aren’t willing to make that sacrifice, especially men who rule their women. However I do believe that many of the women would walk away and opt out if they could.</p>

<div class="md"><p>Dont forget the Taliban formally known as the hoothies before we decided they needed to die were just a rightwing majority group of the region. The US government created the narrative that they are scum of the earth. The reality is if Japan invaded the US, I would be the equivalent of the Taliban in that situation.     It&#39;s not accurate to always think taliban bad, American soldiers good. Why do you think after 20 years of nation building they were able to just run through the whole country and take it back? Because the majority of the region still prefers the taliban over the American installed government.</p>

<div class="md"><p>War is there to end conflicts.

The quran, the bible, no matter which religion we talk about they&#39;re always used to spread hate and opress people. I mean who needs a reason to do a good deed right? But a bad deed, &quot;oh this book told me&quot; &quot; it&#39;s because of my religious beliefes&quot;, that&#39;s where religion comes in handy for evil people. We can see the exact same thing happen in america, but the presence of a proper law and people who enforce it prevent them from doing their harm on others. Because other people don&#39;t deserve that harm being done to them, because they&#39;re black? I don&#39;t think the bible even talks about race once, gay people? Yes they don&#39;t make children, but they&#39;re a minority anyway and we live in overpopulated world. It would even make sense they would exist, in the animal kingdom gay animals adopt babies that have no parents. How are women inferior to men? Oh because the book was written by a man who wanted to have sex with as many women as possible and if they were seen as inferior he could do as he please with them, and they have to be covered from head to toe because they&#39;re his and only his women, so they should be hidden away from others like money in a wallet.

<p>You can hardly say they&#39;re responsible for what happened in the 1990s before they were born or while they were kids.</p>

<p>Since 2001, most of the time the Taliban has just been surviving and fighting special forces of every country on earth at different times.</p>

<div class="md"><p>The Taliban grew in power because of people like this man who brazenly killed so many civilians over the years that people were desperate for any sense of stability from leaders who weren&#39;t willing to bomb civilians to achieve their goals.</p>

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gulbuddin_Hekmatyar">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gulbuddin_Hekmatyar</a></p>

<p>Gulbuddin Hekmatyar (Pashto: ګلبدين حكمتيار‎; born 1 August 1949)[2] is an Afghan politician and former mujahideen leader. He is the founder and current leader of the Hezb-e-Islami Gulbuddin political party, so called after Mohammad Yunus Khalis split from Hezbi Islami in 1979 to found Hezb-i Islami Khalis.[3][4] He has twice served as prime minister during the 1990s.</p>

<p>Hekmaytar joined the Muslim Youth organization as a student in the early 1970s, where he was known for his Islamic radicalism rejected by much of the organization. He spent time in Pakistan before returning to Afghanistan when the Soviet–Afghan War began in 1979, <strong>at which time the CIA began funding his rapidly growing Hezb-e Islami organization through the Pakistani intelligence service, ISI,[5] one of the largest of the Afghan mujahideen. He received more CIA funding than any other mujahideen leader during the Soviet-Afghan War.</strong>[6]</p>

<p><strong>Following the ouster of Soviet-backed Afghan President Mohammad Najibullah in 1992, Hekmatyar declined to form part of the new government and, with other warlords, engaged in the Afghan civil war, leading to the death of around 50,000 civilians in Kabul alone. Hekmatyar was accused of bearing the most responsibility for the rocket attacks on the city.</strong>[7][8] In the meantime, as part of the peace and power-sharing efforts led by Ahmad Shah Massoud, Hekmatyar became Prime Minister of Afghanistan from 1993 to 1994 and again briefly in 1996, before the Taliban takeover of Kabul forced him to flee to Iran&#39;s capital Tehran.[9]</p>

<p>Sometime after the Taliban&#39;s fall in 2001 he went to Pakistan, leading his paramilitary forces into an unsuccessful armed campaign against Hamid Karzai&#39;s government and the international coalition in Afghanistan.[10] In 2016, he signed a peace deal with the Afghan government and was allowed to return to Afghanistan after almost 20 years in exile.[11] </p>

<p>Although <strong>some believe that Hekmatyar threw acid at multiple female students</strong>, others have attributed this claim to the Soviet KGB&#39;s black propaganda.[21] Hekmatyar&#39;s radicalism put him in confrontation with elements in the Muslim Youth surrounding Ahmad Shah Massoud, also an engineering student at Kabul University. <strong>In 1975, trying to assassinate a rival for the second time in three years, Hekmatyar with Pakistani help tried to assassinate Massoud, then 22 years old, but failed.</strong>[22] In 1975, the &quot;Islamic Society&quot; split between supporters of Massoud and Burhanuddin Rabbani, who led the Jamiat-e Islami, and elements surrounding Gulbuddin Hekmatyar, who then founded the Hezb-i Islami. <strong>Akbarzadeh and Yasmeen describe Hekmatyar&#39;s approach as &quot;radical&quot; and antagonistic as opposed to an &quot;inclusive&quot; and &quot;moderate&quot; strategy by Rabbani.</strong>[23]</p>

<p>During the Soviet–Afghan War, <strong>Hekmatyar received large amounts of aid from Saudi Arabia, Pakistan and the United States.</strong>[32][33] <strong>Hekmatyar also gained the support of the British MI6 and even met Margaret Thatcher in Downing Street.</strong>[34] According to the ISI, their decision to allocate the highest percentage of covert aid to Hekmatyar was based on his record as an effective anti-Soviet military commander in Afghanistan.[35] Others describe his position as the result of having &quot;almost no grassroots support and no military base inside Afghanistan&quot;, and thus being the much more &quot;dependent on Pakistani President Zia-ul-Haq&#39;s protection and financial largesse&quot; than other mujahideen factions.[36] <strong>Author Peter Bergen states that &quot;by the most conservative estimates, $600 million&quot; in American aid through Pakistan &quot;went to the Hizb party</strong> ... Hekmatyar&#39;s party had the dubious distinction of never winning a significant battle during the war, training a variety of militant Islamists from around the world, killing significant numbers of mujahideen from other parties, and <strong>taking a virulently anti-Western line</strong>. <strong>In addition to hundreds of millions of dollars of American aid, Hekmatyar also received the lion&#39;s share of aid from the Saudis.</strong>&quot;[37] Hekmatyar&#39;s constant scheming against all of the mujahideen factions led Pakistani general and leader Muhammad Zia-ul-Haq to warn Hekmatyar that it was Pakistan that made him an Afghan leader and that Pakistan could and would destroy him if he resisted operational control by ISI.[38]</p>

<p>Hekmatyar has been harshly criticized[by whom?] for his behavior during the Soviet war and the civil war, and was criticized for his group&#39;s &quot;xenophobic&quot; tendencies.[40] At various times, he both fought against and allied himself with almost every other group in Afghanistan. <strong>He ordered frequent attacks on other rival factions to weaken them in order to improve his position in the post-Soviet power vacuum.</strong> An example of his tendency for internecine rivalry was his arranging the arrest of Ahmad Shah Massoud in Pakistan in 1976 on spying charges.[41] Another example is when Massoud and Hekmatyar agreed to stage a takeover operation in the Panjshir valley—Hekmatyar at the last minute refused to engage his part of the offensive, leaving Massoud open and vulnerable. Massoud&#39;s forces barely escaped with their lives.[42] <strong>In 1987, members of Hekmatyar&#39;s faction killed British cameraman Andy Skrzypkowiak, who was carrying footage of Massoud&#39;s successes to the West. Despite protests from British representatives, Hekmatyar did not punish the culprits, and instead rewarded them with gifts.</strong>[43] Another example of the Hezb-i Islami&#39;s tendency to internecine fighting was given on 9 July 1989, when Sayyed Jamal, one of Hekmatyar&#39;s commanders, ambushed and killed 30 commanders of Massoud&#39;s Shura-ye-Nazar at Farkhar in Takhar province. The attack was typical of Hekmatyar&#39;s strategy of trying to cripple rival factions, and incurred widespread condemnation among the mujahideen.[44]</p>

<p>Another possible instance of Hekmatyar&#39;s treachery[peacock term] toward his rivals occurred in 1987. <strong>The Paris-based group Médecins Sans Frontières reported that Hekmatyar&#39;s guerrillas hijacked a 96-horse caravan bringing aid into northern Afghanistan in 1987, stealing a year&#39;s supply of medicine and cash that was to be distributed to villagers. This would have allowed the villagers to buy food. French relief officials also asserted that Thierry Niquet, an aid coordinator bringing cash to Afghan villagers, was killed by one of Hekmatyar&#39;s commanders in 1986. It is thought that two American journalists traveling with Hekmatyar in 1987, Lee Shapiro and Jim Lindelof, were killed not by the Soviets, as Hekmatyar&#39;s men claimed, but during a firefight initiated by Hekmatyar&#39;s forces against another mujahideen group.</strong>[45] In addition, there were frequent reports throughout the war of Hekmatyar&#39;s commanders negotiating and dealing with pro-Communist local militias in northern Afghanistan.[46]</p>

<p>Hekmatyar made an unlikely alliance with hardline communist and Minister of Defence Shahnawaz Tanai who launched a failed coup attempt in March 1990 against President Najibullah. Many senior members of his party resigned in protest of the coalition, and other Mujahideen groups ridiculed Hekmatyar for uniting with Khalqists to oust the Parcham government.[47]</p>

<p>Hekmatyar has been accused of spending &quot;more time fighting other Mujahideen than killing Soviets.&quot;[48] Hekmatyar remains a controversial figure[49] - <strong>the New York Times once described him as &quot;perhaps the most brutal of a generally brutal group&quot;.</strong>[50]</p>

<div class="md"><p>A highly controversial commander, Hekmatyar has been dubbed the &quot;Butcher of Kabul&quot;, accused of being responsible for the destruction and civilian deaths Kabul experienced in the early 1990s.[51]</p>

<p><strong>A peace agreement was signed with Massoud on 25 May 1992, which made Hekmatyar Prime Minister. However, the agreement fell apart when he was blamed for a rocket attack on President Mojaddedi&#39;s plane.</strong></p>

<p>From 1992 to 1996, the warring factions destroyed most of Kabul and killed thousands, many of them civilians, during the Afghan civil war. All the different parties participated in the destruction,** but Hekmatyar&#39;s group was responsible for most of the damage, because of his practice of deliberately targeting civilian areas.<strong>[56] **Hekmatyar is thought to have bombarded Kabul in retaliation for what he considered its inhabitants&#39; collaboration with the Soviets, and out of religious conviction. He once told a New York Times journalist that Afghanistan &quot;already had one and a half million martyrs. We are ready to offer as many to establish a true Islamic Republic.&quot;</strong>[57] His attacks also had a political objective: to undermine the Rabbani government by proving that Rabbani and Massoud were unable to protect the population.[58] In 1994 Hekmatyar would shift alliances, joining with Dostum as well as Hizb-e-Wahdat, a Hazara Shi&#39;a party, to form the Shura-i Hamahangi (&quot;Council of coordination&quot;). <strong>Together they laid Siege on Kabul, unleashing massive barrages of artillery and rockets that led to the evacuation of U.N. personnel from Kabul, and caused several government members to abandon their posts</strong>. However the new alliance did not spell victory for Hekmatyar, and in June 1994, Massoud had driven Dostum&#39;s troops from the capital.[59]</p>

<p>The Pakistani military had supported Hekmatyar until then in the hope of installing a Pashtun-dominated government in Kabul, which would be friendly to their interests. By 1994, it had become clear that Hekmatyar would never achieve this, and that his extremism had antagonised most Pashtuns, so the Pakistanis began turning towards the predominantly Pashtun Taliban.[60] After capturing Kandahar in November 1994, the Taliban made rapid progress towards Kabul, making inroads into Hezb-i Islami positions. They captured Wardak on 2 February 1995, and moved on to Maidan Shahr on 10 February and Mohammed Agha the next day. Very soon, Hekmatyar found himself caught between the advancing Taliban and the government forces, and the morale of his men collapsed.[61] On 14 February, he was forced to abandon his headquarters at Charasiab, from where rockets were fired at Kabul, and flee in disorder to Surobi.[62]</p>

<p>Nonetheless, in May 1996, Rabbani and Hekmatyar finally formed a power-sharing government in which Hekmatyar was made prime minister. Rabbani was anxious to enhance the legitimacy of his government by enlisting the support of Pashtun leaders. However, the Mahipar agreement did not bring any such benefits to him as Hekmatyar had little grassroots support, but did have many adverse effects: it caused outrage among Jamiat supporters, and among the population of Kabul, who had endured Hekmatyar&#39;s attacks for the last four years. Moreover, the agreement was clearly not what the Pakistanis wanted, and convinced them of Hekmatyar&#39;s weakness, and that they should shift their aid entirely over to the Taliban. Hekmatyar took office on 26 June, and immediately started issuing severe decrees on women&#39;s dress, that struck a sharp contrast with the relatively liberal policy that Massoud had followed until then. The Taliban responded to the agreement with a further spate of rocket attacks on the capital.[63] The Rabbani/Hekmatyar regime lasted only a few months before the Taliban took control of Kabul in September 1996. Many of the HIG local commanders joined the Taliban &quot;both out of ideological sympathy and for reason of tribal solidarity.&quot;[64] Those that did not were expelled by the Taliban. In Pakistan Hezb-e-Islami training camps &quot;were taken over by the Taliban and handed over&quot; to Jamiat Ulema-e-Islam (JUI) groups such as the Sipah-e-Sahaba Pakistan (SSP).[65] Hekmatyar then fled to Massoud&#39;s stronghold in Panjshir who, despite Hekmatyar&#39;s history of animosity towards him, helped him flee to Iran in 1997 where he is said to have resided for almost six years.[66] Isolated from Afghanistan he is reported to have &quot;lost ... his power base back home&quot; to defections or inactivity of former members. He was also distrusted by the Iranian Government who found him too unpredictable, unreliable, and an unnecessary liability, considering its tense relations at the time with the Taliban and the Pakistani government, and despite his pleas, the Iranian Revolutionary Guards refused to establish a proxy through any of his organizations or assist him in any way.[67] Allegedly, they even cut his phone lines and turned away anyone who wished to see him in his villa in North Tehran.[68]</p>

<p>After the 9/11 attacks in the United States Hekmatyar, who had allegedly &quot;worked closely&quot; with bin Laden in early 1990s,[69] declared his opposition to the US campaign in Afghanistan and criticized Pakistan for assisting the United States. After the U.S. entry into the anti-Taliban alliance and the fall of the Taliban, Hekmatyar rejected the U.N.-brokered accord of 5 December 2001 negotiated in Germany as a post-Taliban interim government for Afghanistan. As a result of pressure by the U.S. and the Karzai administration, on 10 February 2002 all the offices of Hezb-e-Islami were closed in Iran and Hekmatyar was expelled by his Iranian hosts.[4]</p>

<p>The United States accused Hekmatyar of urging Taliban fighters to re-form and fight against Coalition troops in Afghanistan. He was also accused of offering bounties for those who kill U.S. troops. He has been labeled a war criminal by members of the U.S.-backed President Hamid Karzai&#39;s government. ISAF identified Hekmatyar in 2002 as the number one security threat, ahead of the Taliban or al-Qaeda.[70] He was also a suspect behind the 5 September 2002 assassination attempt on Karzai in Kandahar and a bomb the same day that killed more than a dozen people in Kabul.[71][72] That same month, he released newsletters and tape messages calling for jihad against the United States. One of his commanders commented that there &quot;will be suicide attacks [...] against soldiers&quot;.[73] On 25 December 2002 news broke that American spy organizations had discovered Hekmatyar attempting to join al-Qaeda. According to the news, he had said that he was available to aid them. However, in a video released by Hekmatyar 1 September 2003, he denied forming alliances with the Taliban or al-Qaeda, but praised attacks against U.S. and international forces.[citation needed]</p>

<p>On February 10, 2003 the Afghan government reported that Hekmatyar was planning an alliance with Taliban and al-Qaeda factions. His group was involved in an intense battle with the U.S. army near Spin Boldak.[74] On February 19, 2003 the United States State Department and the United States Treasury Department jointly designated Hekmatyar a &quot;global terrorist.&quot;[clarification needed][75] This designation meant that any assets Hekmatyar held in the U.S., or held through companies based in the U.S., would be frozen. The U.S. also requested the United Nations Committee on Terrorism to follow suit, and designate Hekmatyar an associate of Osama bin Laden. In October 2003, he declared a ceasefire with local commanders in Jalalabad, Kunar, Logar and Surobi, and stated that they should only fight foreigners.[citation needed]</p>

<p>In May 2006, he released a video to Al Jazeera in which he accused Iran of backing the U.S. in the Afghan conflict and said he was ready to fight alongside Osama bin Laden and blamed the ongoing conflicts in Palestine, Iraq and Afghanistan on U.S. interference.[76] In an audiotape released the same month, he called for revolt against U.S. forces and Karzai&#39;s &quot;puppet government&quot;, and directly threatened to kill Lt. General Karl Eikenberry.[77] In September 2006, he was reported as captured, but the report was later retracted.[78] In December 2006, a video was released in Pakistan, where Gulbuddin Hekmatyar claimed &quot;the fate Soviet Union faced is awaiting America as well.&quot; In January 2007 CNN reported that Hekmatyar claimed &quot;that his fighters helped Osama bin Laden escape from the mountains of Tora Bora five years ago.&quot; BBC news reported a quote from a December 2006 interview broadcast on GEO TV, &quot;We helped them [bin Laden and Zawahiri] get out of the caves and led them to a safe place.&quot;[79]</p>
