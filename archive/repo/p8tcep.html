Advice needed for ass strength.

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Hey.
Today I deadlifted my personal pr of 130 kg.
Came up easy, everything felt good.
After put it down, my ass, started cramping.
It cramped where my butt and tights meet, don&#39;t know the proper name in English, sorry.
After it calmed down ried 140 but failed, whatever.
Cramps again.</p>

<p>I think I&#39;m weak there and that&#39;s what is limiting my max pulls. I hardly ever experience cramps of any kind.</p>

<p>Do you have any tips or recommendations for how/what to train to overcome this?</p>

<p>When I deadlift i usually do 4x4 with 90-100kgs</p>

<p>Thanks in advance.</p>

<p>Ps anti crap stretch recommendations are welcome.</p>

<p>Edit: can inadequate warmup cause this? I was in a hurry, didn&#39;t have much time to train</p>

<div class="md"><p>Maybe you just used your hamstrings. 40kg is quite a big % jump, you are probably just not used to doing it. Try building it up from 100 to 140 in a span of  10 workouts. Before your usual 4x4, just build up to a heavish single, starting at 110kg. Than every DL workout add 5kg to it.</p>

<p>Also incorporate some RDLs and learn to do a correct hip hinge. Whether it was your butt or your hamstring, this exercises will hit both of those muscle groups nicely.</p>

<div class="md"><p>Another set or two working up to a PR might help, but lots of people start about 1 plate.  Were you hydrated and pretty well fed? Lifting cramps after a sweaty day are pretty common - don&#39;t know if that&#39;s just about water or also electrolytes.</p>

<div class="md"><p>I didn&#39;t set this pr now, but it&#39;s my max. My wording was ambiguous.</p>

<p>I ALWAYS eat some before gym, and during cycling ( i usually cycle 15-45m before doing anything) i drink 0.5-1L of water mixed with bca, creatine and glutamine.
I drink well during the day normally too.</p>

<p>70kg is one plate no? 2*25kg+ barbell am I missing something?</p>

<p>It is normal for our bodies to have aches, pains, and other symptoms when we do something we arent used to. A 40% increase in work weight is a big jump, you just have to give your body a chance to adapt. Next session do workweight ay 100kg. Then next session 110kg. Then 115kg etc. Just take your time, dont panic and don&#39;t think too much. </p>

<div class="md"><p>I do hip thrusts on the ground and can really focus that mind muscle connection with them.  Can max well above my dl this way without needing as much grip strength.  Need good padding or your pubic bone will hurt though.</p>
