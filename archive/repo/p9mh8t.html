<div class="md"><p>Second this. All three have an jnsane amount of research backing their effects. All the others the benefit would be negligible .</p>

<div class="md"><p>Because unless you work out fasted and even then bcca’s are not needed, its incomplete proteins. You are better off just having some whey protein instead as it is a complete protein .</p>

<p>Imo bcca’s are a waste of money . Get all your complete proteins from food and whey.</p>

<div class="md"><p>A lot of folks in the evidence-based science-y cutting-edge-y bodybuilding communities chalk it up to marketing hype and say the benefits of using BCAAs are negligible at best. There’s still some folks I see that maintain it’s benefit, but that’s been disputed in the research and studies.</p>

<div class="md"><p>You only need creatine and sufficient protein. 99% of your gains/muscle preservation will come from lifting, protein, anabolics, and sleep. I think NAC is only necessary for liver protection if you&#39;re on anabolics</p>

<p>If you want to be healthy you can just take a multivitamin and Vit D, C, Omega-3, b12, magnesium, etc. I would take him a lot less seriously if he was my coach writing all that nonsense</p>
