<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Okay, it happened. I&#39;m a 44(f) that got too bulky. I read all the articles and believed that I wouldn&#39;t, but I did. I&#39;m reaching for size XL shirts and the arms are too tight. You know those fat suits actors wear? I feel like I stepped into a muscle suit. I dont like it.</p>

<p>Anyone have a plan for stepping down muscle?</p>

<div class="md"><p>Those articles mean it’s very difficult for a woman to accidentally get too muscular, not that it’s impossible to gain weight. </p>

<p>If you’re bigger than you want to be, the solution is to consume less food.</p>

<div class="md"><p>What&#39;s your actual body fat %?  Because it seems like that&#39;s the real issue here.  </p>

<p>Otherwise, since larger muscles are adaptive to exercise, maybe you just switch to aerobic activities for a while?</p>

<div class="md"><p>This is going to sound mean, but it&#39;s not intended that way; are you sure you&#39;re not just putting on too much fat? It&#39;s a pretty difficult thing for a woman to naturally get &quot;bulky&quot; from muscle.</p>

<div class="md"><p>You don&#39;t &#39;step down muscle&#39;. </p>

<p>If you&#39;re too big, because of fat or muscle (and to be honest, it&#39;s likely fat)</p>

<p>You eat less. </p>

<p>If you want to be smaller, eat a calorie deficit. That&#39;s the simple truth.</p>

<div class="md"><p>I got you fam been doing this my whole life. Start playing videos games and drinking Dr Pepper and ordering Panda Express from ubereats and watch that pesky muscle melt away. Oh I forgot. NEVER WORK OUT</p>

<div class="md"><p>Bulking happens when you’re weight training in a caloric surplus. Move to a caloric deficit and you will begin cutting.</p>

<div class="md"><p>I just mimick what others have said here.. you have most likely gained too much bodyfat - not muscle. I am sure you also have put on muscle, but need to go on a diet if your dont like how your clothes fit.</p>

<div class="md"><p>I would try to get the highest quality body scan or equivalent done to give a better sense of what your body composition is to try to orient your goal setting/planning.  In the mean time I would stick to mostly cardio but I wouldn’t stop resistance training all together.</p>

<div class="md"><p>I agree. Find out what is really muscle and what may be fat and figure out where you want to go from there. You don’t have to progressively overload once you reach where you want to be. Just maintain.</p>

<div class="md"><p>It sounds like youve gotten too fat. Just do a simple deficit to shed a bunch.</p>
