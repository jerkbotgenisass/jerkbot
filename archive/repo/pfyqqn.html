COVID denialism and policy clarifications

<div class="post">
<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>“Happy” Wednesday everyone</p>

<p>As <a href="/u/spez">u/spez</a> mentioned in his <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/announcements/comments/pbmy5y/debate_dissent_and_protest_on_reddit/">announcement post</a> last week, COVID has been hard on all of us. It will likely go down as one of the most defining periods of our generation. Many of us have lost loved ones to the virus. It has caused confusion, fear, frustration, and served to further divide us. It is my job to oversee the enforcement of our policies on the platform. I’ve never professed to be perfect at this. Our policies, and how we enforce them, evolve with time. We base these evolutions on two things: user trends and data. Last year, after we rolled out <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/announcements/comments/hi3oht/update_to_our_content_policy/">the largest policy change in Reddit’s history</a>, I shared a <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/redditsecurity/comments/idclo1/understanding_hate_on_reddit_and_the_impact_of/">post</a> on the prevalence of hateful content on the platform. Today, many of our users are telling us that they are confused and even frustrated with our handling of COVID denial content on the platform, so it seemed like the right time for us to share some data around the topic. </p>

<p><em>Analysis of Covid Denial</em></p>

<p>We sought to answer the following questions:</p>

<ul>
<li>How often is this content submitted?</li>
<li>What is the community reception?</li>
<li>Where are the concentration centers for this content?</li>
</ul>

<p>Below is a chart of all of the COVID-related content that has been posted on the platform since January 1, 2020. We are using common keywords and known COVID focused communities to measure this. The volume has been relatively flat since mid last year, but since July (coinciding with the increased prevalence of the Delta variant), we have seen a sizable increase. </p>

<p><a href="https://preview.redd.it/5draikoecxk71.png?width=1145&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=4aa9a815e3b8637ad2c8f1a654b1b5f82cac4d97">COVID Content Submissions</a></p>

<p>The trend is even more notable when we look at COVID-related content reported to us by users. Since August, we see approximately 2.5k reports/day vs an average of around 500 reports/day a year ago. This is approximately 2.5% of all COVID related content. </p>

<p><a href="https://preview.redd.it/v35d5wfgcxk71.png?width=1146&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=f6604d4fae70f04ba0cbf5beb3949aab5169fc99">Reports on COVID Content</a></p>

<p>While this data alone does not tell us that COVID denial content on the platform is increasing, it is certainly an indicator. To help make this story more clear, we looked into potential networks of denial communities. There are some well known subreddits dedicated to discussing and challenging the policy response to COVID, and we used this as a basis to identify other similar subreddits. I’ll refer to these as “high signal subs.”</p>

<p>Last year, we saw that less than 1% of COVID content came from these high signal subs, today we see that it&#39;s over 3%. COVID content in these communities is around 3x more likely to be reported than in other communities (this is fairly consistent over the last year). Together with information above we can infer that there has been an increase in COVID denial content on the platform, and that increase has been more pronounced since July. While the increase is suboptimal, it is noteworthy that the large majority of the content is outside of these COVID denial subreddits. It’s also hard to put an exact number on the increase or the overall volume. </p>

<p>An important part of our moderation structure is the community members themselves. How are users responding to COVID-related posts? How much visibility do they have? Is there a difference in the response in these high signal subs than the rest of Reddit?</p>

<p>High Signal Subs</p>

<ul>
<li>Content positively received - 48% on posts, 43% on comments</li>
<li>Median exposure - 119 viewers on posts, 100 viewers on comments</li>
<li>Median vote count - 21 on posts, 5 on comments</li>
</ul>

<p>All Other Subs</p>

<ul>
<li>Content positively received - 27% on posts, 41% on comments</li>
<li>Median exposure - 24 viewers on posts, 100 viewers on comments</li>
<li>Median vote count - 10 on posts, 6 on comments</li>
</ul>

<p>This tells us that in these high signal subs, there is generally less of the critical feedback mechanism than we would expect to see in other non-denial based subreddits, which leads to content in these communities being more visible than the typical COVID post in other subreddits. </p>

<p><em>Interference Analysis</em></p>

<p>In addition to this, we have also been investigating the claims around targeted interference by some of these subreddits. While we want to be a place where people can explore unpopular views, it is never acceptable to interfere with other communities. Claims of “brigading” are common and often hard to quantify. However, in this case, we found very clear signals indicating that <a href="/r/NoNewNormal">r/NoNewNormal</a> was the source of around 80 brigades in the last 30 days (largely directed at communities with more mainstream views on COVID or location-based communities that have been discussing COVID restrictions). This behavior continued even after a warning was issued from our team to the Mods. <a href="/r/NoNewNormal">r/NoNewNormal</a> is the only subreddit in our list of high signal subs where we have identified this behavior and it is one of the largest sources of community interference we surfaced as part of this work (we will be investigating a few other unrelated subreddits as well). </p>

<p><em>Analysis into Action</em></p>

<p>We are taking several actions:</p>

<ol>
<li>Ban <a href="/r/NoNewNormal">r/NoNewNormal</a> immediately for breaking our rules against brigading</li>
<li>Quarantine 54 additional COVID denial subreddits under <a href="https://www.redditinc.com/policies/content-policy">Rule 1</a></li>
<li>Build a new reporting feature for moderators to allow them to better provide us signal when they see community interference. It will take us a few days to get this built, and we will subsequently evaluate the usefulness of this feature. </li>
</ol>

<p><em>Clarifying our Policies</em></p>

<p>We also hear the feedback that our policies are not clear around our handling of health misinformation. To address this, we wanted to provide a summary of our current approach to misinformation/disinformation in our <a href="https://www.redditinc.com/policies/content-policy">Content Policy</a>. </p>

<p>Our approach is broken out into (1) how we deal with health misinformation (falsifiable health related information that is disseminated regardless of intent), (2) health disinformation (falsifiable health information that is disseminated with an intent to mislead), (3) problematic subreddits that pose misinformation risks, and (4) problematic users who invade other subreddits to “debate” topics unrelated to the wants/needs of that community. </p>

<ol>
<li><p>Health Misinformation. We have long interpreted our rule against posting content that “encourages” physical harm, in this <a href="https://www.reddithelp.com/hc/en-us/articles/360043513151">help center article</a>, as covering health misinformation, meaning falsifiable health information that encourages or poses a significant risk of physical harm to the reader. For example, a post pushing a verifiably false “cure” for cancer that would actually result in harm to people would violate our policies.  </p></li>
<li><p>Health Disinformation. Our rule against impersonation, as described in this <a href="https://www.reddithelp.com/hc/en-us/articles/360043075032">help center article</a>, extends to “manipulated content presented to mislead.” We have interpreted this rule as covering health disinformation, meaning falsifiable health information that has been manipulated and presented to mislead. This includes falsified medical data and faked WHO/CDC advice.  </p></li>
<li><p>Problematic subreddits.  We have long applied <a href="https://www.reddithelp.com/hc/en-us/articles/360043069012">quarantine</a> to communities that warrant additional scrutiny. The purpose of quarantining a community is to prevent its content from being accidentally viewed or viewed without appropriate context. </p></li>
<li><p>Community Interference. Also relevant to the discussion of the activities of problematic subreddits, <a href="https://www.redditinc.com/policies/content-policy">Rule 2</a> forbids users or communities from “cheating” or engaging in “content manipulation” or otherwise interfering with or disrupting Reddit communities.  We have interpreted this rule as forbidding communities from manipulating the platform, creating inauthentic conversations, and picking fights with other communities. We typically enforce Rule 2 through our anti-brigading efforts, although it is still an example of bad behavior that has led to bans of a variety of subreddits.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>As I mentioned at the start, we never claim to be perfect at these things but our goal is to constantly evolve. These prevalence studies are helpful for evolving our thinking. We also need to evolve how we communicate our policy and enforcement decisions. As always, I will stick around to answer your questions and will also be joined by <a href="/u/traceroo">u/traceroo</a> our GC and head of policy.</p>

<div class="md"><p>I would like to ask for a clarification - <a href="/r/NoNewNormal">r/NoNewNormal</a> was explicitly banned for &quot;content manipulation&quot; which you have outlined in this post.</p>

<p>Does this mean that if they were not to be brigading, they would not have been banned?  Would they have been banned &quot;merely&quot; for hosting dangerous health-related disinformation?</p>

<div class="md"><p>Brigading is just the excuse they are using to ban the sub. It&#39;s kind of like catch all that admins can whip out since it&#39;s hard to disprove. NNN might have been a scum subreddit, but I think it&#39;s unfair to use that BS reason as justification to ban the sub. It lets reddit off the hook for creating real policies to address the real issues. The other thing is that the rules against brigading aren&#39;t carried out equally. For example, that sub that got turned into horse porn was clearly brigaded by a few subs but nothing is being done about it. Just my 2 cents as a casual observationist of the current happenings at reddit.</p>

<p>Ivermectin specifically is explicitly not approved for use as a treatment against covid, but <a href="/r/ivermectin">r/ivermectin</a> exists almost solely to promote it as such. Why was it not included in the ban?</p>

<p>I would go further and say that not only is it not an approved course of treatment for COVID, the FDA explicitly states that people should <em>not</em> take ivermectin either as a treatment for COVID or as a prophylactic and includes the statement:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Taking large doses of this drug is dangerous and can cause serious harm. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>If reddit&#39;s quoted statement on the matter is:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>For example, a post pushing a verifiably false “cure” for cancer that would actually result in harm to people would violate our policies.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Would the FDA&#39;s assertion that ivermectin does not treat COVID and is dangerous when consumed without the explicit direction of a physician make the suggestion of using ivermectin &quot;verifiably false&quot; and &quot;would actually result in harm to people&quot;?</p>

<div class="md"><p>It should be banned. Before the subreddit became a glorious equine hentai headquarters, it was people sharing info on how to dose livestock dewormer. </p>

<p>I think the topic of ivermectin itself is a bit more complicated, because human versions of it do exist for parasites, and some countries are (stupidly) using it for covid, like they mistakenly did for HQL. But the intent of the sub was how to dangerously self treat covid with a livestock medication, and it&#39;s baffling how that could be allowed.</p>

<div class="md"><p>This isn&#39;t true for every country, but it&#39;s getting people killed in some of them. Because of the stance of the FDA, an American can&#39;t obtain ivermectin without getting it from unconventional sources that aren&#39;t meant for humans, and taking it in doses that aren&#39;t approved by a physician.</p>

<p>I acknowledge that not every health agency in the world agrees with the FDA but the salient fact is that the FDA&#39;s stance means that most people don&#39;t have a safe way to take the drug. This is true for every country wherein human-approved ivermectin requires a legitimate prescription to obtain.</p>

<div class="md"><p>Again, not every country. In some countries is up to the doctor to decide if you should take it or not (like where i live). some do, some don&#39;t. but i understand the argument and why it is so US-focused now. Thanks, bro</p>

<div class="md"><p>That&#39;s certainly...a sentence, but I don&#39;t think it actually conveys any meaning at all.</p>

<p>The FDA exists to regulate drugs and the claims regarding what those drugs can do.  If the FDA says a drug is not approved for one use and has harmful side effects, it is reasonable to believe that they are making that statement with evidence to support it.  It is thus also reasonable to believe that statements which are contrary to that, do not have strong evidence to support them.</p>

<div class="md"><p>It is important to note that FDA issues it&#39;s approval after a very stringent review process, and rarely revokes that approval. Manufacturers have issued recalls left right and center, but once a drug gets through the FDA approval process (Note: not grandfathered in), there has not been a single one pulled since 2010 that has not since gone back to market, and of those, all of them had been developed in the preceding years. Any circumstances over which a drug would be found worthy of having this approval revoked would have to <strong>A)</strong> Be new <strong>B)</strong> Have some obscure interaction or long term effect that evaded initial reviews.</p>

<p>Now - to the context at hand:</p>

<p>Ivermectin has been on the market for a long-ass time - it was first developed as a drug in the 1970&#39;s iirc. It&#39;s side effects, dosages and uses are well known. We do not need to rely on the FDA&#39;s judgement of this drug to know that <strong>A)</strong> Taking a medicine at a mix and dosage rated for a 500 pound animal is dumb, dangerous, and dangerously dumb. There is no amount of government banter in either direction that should convince you that this is ever a good idea. <strong>B)</strong> <del>A drug that is approved for external use only on humans should not be taken internally! That should go without saying.</del> (I have verified at another&#39;s prompting that there are in fact oral variants of Ivermectin on the market, though most of the point does still stand.) While it is entirely possible that there *could* be some miracle interaction between Ivermectin and Covid that makes it an effective treatment (stranger accidents have happened), without such a relationship being proven, tested, and approved, taking random substances on heresay, especially substances that are advised NOT to be taken in that manner, is lunacy.</p>

<p>By a simple process of induction from A and B, we can infer that anyone who is reccomending taking Ivermectin orally to treat covid is actively spreading harmful advice, and should be treated with the same vehemence as those who advocate injecting bleach.</p>

<div class="md"><p>Eh, the FDA isn&#39;t very competent. Here are a few examples that spring to mind:</p>

<ul>
<li>In early 2020, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/10/us/coronavirus-testing-delays.html">the FDA banned labs from covid testing and the only reason we discovered community spread was because a lab in Seattle broke the law</a>.</li>
<li>Soon after, <a href="https://marginalrevolution.com/marginalrevolution/2020/03/fda-stops-at-home-tests.html">the FDA banned all at-home sample collection</a>.</li>
<li>The FDA <a href="https://astralcodexten.substack.com/p/details-of-the-infant-fish-oil-story">took 14 years to approve a nutrient formula to treat infant short bowel syndrome, causing thousands of babies to die</a>.</li>
</ul>

<p>The FDA is an incredibly risk-averse organization and it can take decades to correct course. FDA staff get in trouble if they approve something that ends up being harmful, but they don&#39;t get in trouble if they refuse to approve something that ends up saving tons of lives. This is why a lot of HIV/AIDS drugs took so long to be developed. For example: AZT was invented in 1964, and researchers realized its value in treating HIV/AIDS in the early 80s, but the FDA didn&#39;t approve it until 1987. Amusingly the press boasted of this achievement as it was the fastest drug approval in decades.</p>

<div class="md"><p>Ok, so a couple things here. </p>

<p>1) Your posts equates the FDA being risk-averse to being incompetent. This is not true. The FDA is risk-averse for a reason, not just because they want to be.  The FDA is responsible for “protecting the public health by assuring the safety, effectiveness, quality, and security of human and veterinary drugs, vaccines and other biological products, and medical devices.” I do not think that taking risks fits in to the above quoted goal of the FDA. Therefore, being risk-averse actually makes the FDA <em>competent</em>.</p>

<p>2) If the FDA is risk-averse (your words, although I agree) AND the FDA has now fully approved a vaccine (Pfizer) then what possible reason would one have for taking a medicine that is NOT approved by the FDA to safely prevent or treat COVID variants when a medicine that is approved by the FDA for this use exists?  If the “incredibly risk averse” FDA has approved a vaccine, shouldn’t that be enough? Why are there people out there pushing an unproven therapy when a proven safe and effective preventative measure exists?</p>

<p>3) Many of the “studies” showing ivermectin effectiveness contain misleading data or data that was manipulated to appear worse by lacking context, as noted by a great piece linked below. To me this automatically puts ivermectin in the “health disinformation” category, at the very least.</p>

<p>4) People are literally dying because they are choosing not to get the vaccine and instead take ivermectin. These people are making this decision because of the disinformation they are exposed to. A simple google search of “ivermectin covid death unvaccinated” will unearth a plethora of news stories of anti vax people who turned to ivermectin instead of the vaccine and ultimately died for it.  Do you really think these people would be taking ivermectin if their favorite media personalities weren’t pushing it like OxyContin in the 00’s to them?</p>

<div class="md"><p>I&#39;m not saying the FDA or CDC are wrong about ivermectin or HCQ. Nowhere in my comment history will you see me defending such treatments, nor will you see me being wary of the vaccines. If anything I try to correct the mistaken views of the vaccine skeptics.</p>

<p>My point is that if we adopt a policy of &quot;ban all views that contradict the health authorities&quot;, we&#39;ll ban some views that turn out to be correct. I distinctly remember being scolded by some of my peers for wearing a P100 mask in March of 2020. I was told I was an idiot because &quot;everyone knows&quot; that masks don&#39;t work. Around a year later, one of those same people chastised me for not wearing a mask outdoors. I was vaccinated and I knew the risks of catching or spreading covid in such situations was less than a masked unvaccinated person, but the CDC guidance hadn&#39;t yet been updated. One of my friends got an unofficial &quot;booster&quot; by driving to a neighboring state and getting a shot of Moderna. (He&#39;d previously had both shots of Pfizer.) Such practices currently go against all health guidelines (and are probably illegal), but is there any doubt that a subreddit dedicated to helping people get unofficial boosters would be treated much differently than the anti-vaxx/ivermectin/HCQ subreddits? So clearly the policy can&#39;t be to ban everything that contradicts the health authorities.</p>

<p>I would think the FDA makes that statement based on the evidence:</p>

<ul>
<li>Ivermectin is an anti-parasitic, not an anti-viral drug and thus does not treat or prevent the SARS-CoV-2 virus which causes COVID and there is no data to suggest otherwise</li>
<li>Ivermectin, sold at animal and farm supply stores which subreddits such as <a href="/r/ivermectin">r/ivermectin</a> often encourage others to purchase from, is distributed in much larger quantities than is safe for human consumption due to their intended use for much larger and heavier animals (such as horses)</li>
<li>The consumption of any prescription medication should be directed by a medical professional who understands your medical history and can prescribe exact amounts that are safe for you, and in general the overconsumption of prescription medication is dangerous and can lead to many undesirable side effects including death</li>

<div class="md"><p>Pharmacist here. While obviously taking ivermectin is not a good idea unless recommended by a physician, very few drugs are “clean”, meaning that they only interact with a specific receptor or other system and no others - in fact, it’s very common for drugs to have multiple interactions with multiple systems. There is no magic “antivirus” button that we can push while not pushing any other buttons. There are only complex systems, which often have similarities across systems leading to multiple effects - particularly across anti-biotics, anti-virals, anti-parasitics, and anti-inflammatories - which means that describing ivermectin as “not an anti-viral drug” is problematic, because it implies that anti-parasitics cannot have anti-viral properties, which is not the case. </p>

<p>“Thus does not treat or prevent” is also problematic, because the majority of treatments in the current and ever-evolving therapy for COVID are not anti-virals. </p>

<ol>
<li>there is a difference between innocuously &quot;discussing&quot; science and pushing misleading information. people can discuss potential bleeding edge research about covid treatment all they want, but when you start pushing information implying that it&#39;s safe to take (or worse - encouraging to take) a drug that (a) not only has very little evidence supporting its efficacy but also (b) has a wide consensus to actually be dangerous based on decades of hard evidence, you are crossing the line from &quot;discussing&quot; into &quot;actively spreading dangerous misinformation that can lead people to harm&quot;</li>
<li>yes, peer reviewed journals are not infallible. but you would be absolutely fucking insane to argue that they have less legitimacy and are less worthy of trust than random blogs and articles on the internet. the entire point of the peer review process is that the more <strong>qualified</strong> eyeballs (eyeballs belonging to people who have years and decades in the field and have been vetted by the rest of the scientific community) have hit a study and approved it, the more trustworthy it is and the more likely it is to be true.

<p>Two retrospective prepublication reports have appeared in which clinical outcomes were evaluated in hospitalised patients with COVID-19, some of whom received treatment with ivermectin. Rajter et al have reported that, in univariate analysis, mortality in 173 patients receiving one or more doses of ivermectin was significantly lower than in 107 patients not so treated (15% vs 25.2%, p=0.03); after multivariate adjustment for pertinent covariates, this mortality difference was confirmed (OR 0.27, p=0.03; HR 0.37, p=0.03).10 Gorial et al examined the mean time of hospital stay in patients who either received or did not receive on admission a standard clinical dose of ivermectin (200 μg/kg) as an adjunct to treatment with hydroxychloroquine/azithromycin. The 16 patients who received ivermectin had hospital stays averaging 7.62 days, notably lower than the average hospital stays of 71 patients not receiving ivermectin (13.22 days; p=0.00005). Two patients died in the control group, none in the ivermectin group.11 Note that these apparent therapeutic benefits were seen in hospitalised patients, in whom antiviral measures are suspected to be less effective than anti-inflammatory measures targeting cytokine storm.</p>

<div class="md"><p>This is the peer reviewed study that was released in the July/August edition of the Journal of American Therapeutics:</p>

<p><a href="https://journals.lww.com/americantherapeutics/fulltext/2021/08000/ivermectin_for_prevention_and_treatment_of.7.aspx">https://journals.lww.com/americantherapeutics/fulltext/2021/08000/ivermectin_for_prevention_and_treatment_of.7.aspx</a></p>

<p>-=Excerpt=-</p>

<p>Conclusions: </p>

<p>Moderate-certainty evidence finds that large reductions in COVID-19 deaths are possible using ivermectin. Using ivermectin early in the clinical course may reduce numbers progressing to severe disease. The apparent safety and low cost suggest that ivermectin is likely to have a significant impact on the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic globally.</p>

<div class="md"><p>It is false, there have been studies proving that ivermectin does not make any difference as a treatment to covid.</p>

<p>People are DYING because they read this misinformation and used ivermectin to treat themselves rather than get the vaccine or even go to the hospital.

<div class="md"><p>The theater example is used so often that it gets old. That’s a direct call to action in the moment, and not considered speech. Either way, no need to go down that path of arguing since it’s clear as day under the law what a call to action is compared to free speech.</p>

<p>Anyways, people don’t have the right to not get information that would potentially kill them. I hear things everyday that could kill me; it doesn’t mean those statements should be banned. Simple as that. If I told you to take cyanide because it would cure your cancer, do you think my speech saying that should be banned? Under the law, obviously not. A private company can do what they want and I agree with their right to do so, but I don’t think they should be limiting the speech of their users. Maybe just a difference in opinion…</p>

<div class="md"><p>My conclusion is that Reddit is responding subreddits going private.  The preference, and the initial plan, was to try to ride this out with minimal action.  He who governs least governs best, or something.</p>

<p>But it became clear the userbase, and specifically the handful of power mods who control the largest subreddits, weren&#39;t going to accept that.  So now they&#39;ve gone and done an investigation, put together data and laid out an explanation for acting that doesn&#39;t include &quot;caving to pressure&quot;.</p>

<p>But they did cave to pressure.  And that&#39;s good, because this is important. Spez didn&#39;t want to eat the bucket of crow so they&#39;re sending this guy out to explain why this isn&#39;t a reversal.</p>

<p>On the one hand: <strong>Thank you</strong>.</p>

<p>On the other hand: Contrast today&#39;s post here on <a href="/r/Redditsecurity">r/Redditsecurity</a> with <a href="https://old.reddit.com/r/announcements/comments/pbmy5y/debate_dissent_and_protest_on_reddit/">the post six days ago</a> on <a href="/r/Announcements">r/Announcements</a> which was (intended or not) widely interpreted by the userbase as <em>&quot;<a href="/r/NoNewNormal">r/NoNewNormal</a> is not doing anything wrong.&quot;</em> Did something drastic change in those six days? Was the <a href="/r/Announcements">r/Announcements</a> post made before Reddit&#39;s security team could finish compiling their data? Did Reddit take this action due to the response that the <a href="/r/Announcements">r/Announcements</a> post generated? Should, perhaps, Reddit <strong>not</strong> take to the <a href="/r/Announcements">r/Announcements</a> page <em>before</em> checking to make sure that everyone&#39;s on the same page? Whereas I, as myself, want to believe that Reddit was in the process of making the right call, and the <a href="/r/Annoucements">r/Annoucements</a> post was more one approaching the situation for a philosophy <em>vs</em> policy standpoint, Reddit&#39;s actions open the door to accusations of &quot;They tried to let the problem subreddits get away with it in the name of Principal, and had to backpedal <em>fast</em> when they saw the result&quot;, and that&#39;s an &quot;own goal&quot; that didn&#39;t need to happen.</p>

<p>On the gripping hand: With the banning of <a href="/r/The_Donald">r/The_Donald</a> and now <a href="/r/NoNewNormal">r/NoNewNormal</a>, Reddit appears to be leaning into the philosophy of &quot;While the principals of free speech, free expression of ideas, and the marketplace of competing ideas are all critical to a functioning democracy and to humanity as a whole, <em>none of those principals are absolutes</em>, and users / communities that attempt to weaponize them will not be tolerated.&quot; Is that an accurate summation?</p>

<p>In closing, thank you for all the hard work, and for being willing to stamp out the inevitable ban evasion subs, face the vitrol-laced response of the targeted members / communities, and all the other ramifications of trying to make Reddit a better place. It&#39;s appreciated.</p>

<p>Call me a cynic, but if you have the data and the analysis, and you might be about to face some harsh questions in Congress about why you don&#39;t do anything about disinformation and problematic communities on your platform, you might, for example, decide to avoid the additional bad publicity of having a load of your subreddits private and a load of mods asking you to do something about harmful disinformation.</p>

<div class="md"><p>I appreciate the question. You have a lot in here, but I’d like to focus on the second part. I generally frame this as the difference between a subreddit’s stated goals, and their behavior. While we want people to be able to explore ideas, they still have to function as a healthy community. That means that community members act in good faith when they see “bad” content (downvote, and report), mods act as partners with admins by removing violating content, and the whole group doesn’t actively undermine the safety and trust of other communities. The preamble of our content policy touches on this:  “While not every community may be for you (and you may find some unrelatable or even offensive), no community should be used as a weapon. Communities should create a sense of belonging for their members, not try to diminish it for others.”</p>

<div class="md"><p><em>Reddit has some identity reconciliation to do.</em><br/>
“Community members [of those high signal communities] act in good faith when they see “bad” content…” <strong>Guys, we live in a different world now.</strong> It’s time to match our work with that reality. Where cult behavior can not and should not be endorsed, validated and spread in the name of Reddit policy or first amendment rights. <strong>THIS IS NOT THAT HARD</strong> Hate speech has already been defined to not be included with free speech and neither is/should be speech (an expression of an “opinion”) that includes willful medical negligence; the kind that <em>does</em> get people killed.  </p>

<p>So your definition of a healthy sub is all well intentioned sure, but members of these high signal communities <em>are no longer doing what’s right,</em> and then falsely hiding behind “I have a right to my opinions.” Again, because cults. It just cannot be clearer.</p>

<div class="md"><p>Not defending these subs being banned, but I&#39;d be cautious decrying &#39;cult behavior&#39; as a good enough reason to ban a community.

Its way too easy to label anything you dont agree with as &#39;a big cult of harmful ideas&#39;, and it just proliferates echo-chamber mentality to squash ideas you disagree with- even if you cant fathom why they exist at all. As long as they are playing fair and not actively harming other communities, of course.</p>

<div class="md"><p>Who defined hate speech as not protected be Free Speech? It wasn&#39;t the American Supreme Court, which unanimously held that there was no hate speech exception to the 1st Amendment in Matal v. Tam (2017). Snyder v. Phelps (2010) is another good case to review.  Obviously Reddit is not the government, so they are free to ban hate speech, I just wanted to point out the misinformation you were spreading in your comment. If you&#39;re in a country where hate speech is not protected speech, this might just be an honest mistake, but since reddit is an American company, using the American formulation of free speech makes more sense.</p>

<div class="md"><p>Equating Covid misinformation and Hate speech to wrongthink is disingenuous and a slippery slope argument. This is a logical fallacy.  Calling out hate speech or deadly misinformation and not allowing it on a platform does not mean that Reddit will one day ban me because I think colodial silver is not a remedy for diabetes or that I think Joe Rogan is a dumpster fire.</p>

<p>Here is a good post from the UN regarding the handling of hate speech.  Misinformation follows general suit.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.un.org/en/genocideprevention/documents/UN%20Strategy%20and%20Plan%20of%20Action%20on%20Hate%20Speech%2018%20June%20SYNOPSIS.pdf">https://www.un.org/en/genocideprevention/documents/UN%20Strategy%20and%20Plan%20of%20Action%20on%20Hate%20Speech%2018%20June%20SYNOPSIS.pdf</a></p>

<p>&quot;Silence can signal indifference  to  bigotry  and  intolerance,  even  as  a  situation  escalates  and  the  vulnerable become victims.&quot;</p>

<p>This is what has happened with covid disinformation.  As Reddit has refused to push back the most vulnerable have been indoctrinated into a belief that could very well get them hospitalized or killed.</p>

<div class="md"><p>Huh. It&#39;s almost like bad ideas attract bad, dangerous people who break the rules. </p>

<p>Didn&#39;t you guys learn from the jailbait fiasco? You know, the one where the admin team defended the posting of sexually suggestive photos of minors without their consent up until the sub reddit attracted <em>actual</em> pedophiles who were trading CP in DMs? Or how about the conspiracy daycare fiasco, when Q anons on reddit organized a 24-hour stalking campaign at a rural daycare thinking they had uncovered a Democrat child sex trafficking ring. </p>

<p>If you create communities for extremists and dangerous people, you attract extremists and dangerous people. Today it&#39;s anti vaxxers, tomorrow it will be domestic terrorists. Reddit is already complicit in numerous violent actions carried out by people indoctrinated into extremist ideologies on this site. How much blood has to be on your hands before you ban a community?</p>

<p>I have no problem with you being corrupt, but at least be honest about it. Don&#39;t pretend you have some blanket rule when you use it incredibly selectively. Have some actual integrity</p>

<div class="md"><p>Can you answer the first part of the question? I think that&#39;s the one that concerns us the most, the fact that the community widely believed Spez&#39;s previous announcement to be a defense of these subreddits and their ability to engage in medical misinformation campaigns. There was a sense from that post that the rules didn&#39;t apply to those misinformation subs.</p>

<p>Also, this is important too: for that previous announcement thread extolling the virtues of differing opinions and debate, why were the comments locked? It seems totally hypocritical.</p>

<p>Would it have been appropriate for the NNN mods to instead have posted a sticky at the top of the subreddit telling the admins to take action against liberal subreddits so users in the comments can post their most reviled liberal subreddits for other users to visit?</p>

<p>Then, if they didn&#39;t get their way, could they shut down the subreddit and force every user to see a single text box directly pointing to a specific liberal subreddit to target?</p>

<p>Like forcing a subreddit mentioned in the above actions to be overtaken by horse porn? How about moderators using a bot to ban users across dozens of subreddits for just posting in another subreddit?</p>

<p>I&#39;m attempting to highlight a point. I didn&#39;t want to choose &quot;conservative subreddits&quot; since I bet a large majority commenting here would agree that<a href="https://old.reddit.com/r/redditsecurity/comments/pfyqqn/covid_denialism_and_policy_clarifications/hb7xw2t/"> those should be banned, too</a>.</p>

<p>Admins are saying NNN was banned not for being misinformation but for brigading outside subreddits. I proposed an action the mods have all but endorsed (when targeted at NNN) and asked if it would be fine when targeted at liberal subreddits.</p>

<p>If it&#39;s fine to target NNN with a coordinated negative action campaign then it should be fine to target liberal subreddits - or any subreddit, as well.</p>

<div class="md"><p>I think it is important to note that liberals largely don&#39;t consider Covid to be a political issue.

The left wing side of the Covid discussion relies on the discovery of objective science, which by its nature, is apolitical. The right wing side of the Covid discussion relies on discrediting objective science, accusing public health officials of political bias and outright lies (which makes no sense whatsoever), and very clearly makes everything related to Covid a political issue.</p>

<p>The abstraction works because the admins have (1) not claimed to ban NNN for misinformation but instead for brigading and (2) have no amendments to their rules saying &quot;yeah these rules can be broken when you feel like they&#39;re justified.&quot;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>Like you, I realized they were full of incorrect medical information and populated largely by morons and decided to not use them for medical advice. I&#39;m treating others with the same respect to make their own decisions.</p>

<p>What I don&#39;t like is having people come down from on high and tell me what information I&#39;m not allowed to see. The fact that I can see these people spew their idiocy makes me more confident that the information I actually need to see is freely available to me and that some of their questioning can actually help me be informed about my contrarian opinion towards them.</p>

<div class="md"><p>&quot;While we want people to be able to explore ideas&quot; they simply can&#39;t be ideas that we don&#39;t agree with politically. If they disobey our politics they will be banned.</p>

<p>To help clarify: sub reddits like <a href="/r/politics">/r/politics</a> and <a href="/r/news">/r/news</a> universally break the rules around site manipulation, brigading, etc. in ways that are transparently obvious to the entire community. Because these subs produce shrill authoritarian left wing propaganda that sooths our preexisting partisan biases, we at reddit celebrate their behavior.</p>

<p>&quot;mods act as partners with admins by removing violating content&quot; There are a handful of likeminded fellow travelers that we have empowered to censor unacceptable political thought throughout the site. There is no accountability, transparency or even expectation of fairness in this process. Their job is to destroy our partisan enemies not actually enforce &quot;rules&quot;. We&#39;re kind of embarrassed with how shamelessly partisan this process is so we&#39;re obfuscating the hideous reality we created under the guide of &quot;health&quot;.</p>

<div class="md"><p>On the topic of community consensus, what is the point in letting moderators moderate over a dozen or so boards? All it seems to do is give disproportionate power to people who genuinely are on the internet way too much. Given that there is also concrete proof now that some moderators have formed little cabals to push various agendas, many which have merits but others that are far from lucid, does this not seem like a potentially disastrous situation?</p>

<p>Issues like anti-vaccination are rather cut-and-dry, but what about a scenario which is more complicated, something with limited information such as an international conflict. This sort of behaviour could cause serious harm or worse. <a href="/r/NoNewNormal">r/NoNewNormal</a> was likely the result of a faction like this, just something to consider if you think I am aiming at anyone in particular, just want to purvey a hopefully broader perspective on where such behaviour might lead regardless of motivation.</p>

<p>The fact that reddit admins seem to think all members of the site will act in good faith when they see &quot;bad&quot; content is pretty laughable.  How have you guys not learned at this point that people will generally upvote what they agree with/like and downvote what they disagree with/don&#39;t like?</p>

<div class="md"><p>It sounds a lot like NoNewNormal was banned for brigading, as opposed to the fountain of harmful, misleading, and potentially dangerous mis- and dis-information. Does it read like this to anyone else?</p>

<p>While I’m ecstatic that they’re gone, I think Reddit’s definition of “healthy community” should expand a bit to define subs that purposely and consistently post content that is intentionally misleading or outright false and present it as fact, sourced journalism, or the result of peer-reviewed scientific study as “unhealthy”. I realize that’s broad and open to interpretation, but it also fits NNN (and similar anti-vax/anti-science subs) to a T. </p>

<p>The goals of the users and mods of those subs actively attempt to <em>undermine</em> objective facts and truth in an attempt to push an agenda. I’d really like to see more efforts to impose consequences on subs engaging in that kind of activity, rather than letting them believe that as long as they don’t brigade, they’re free to poison the discourse to whatever lengths they desire.</p>

<div class="md"><p>I’m thrilled they’re making you feel unwelcome here. even moreso entertained by the fact that you’re so absolutely unaware of the answer you’ve already been given (maybe it’s not from a source you find trustworthy lol) </p>

<p>I’ll make it clear for you since you have a hard time understanding:  the analytics they have tells them which users are voting a certain way. When the vast majority of those users also frequently post/comment in a particular subreddit full of dimwits, it becomes blatantly obvious that it is an attack on a different perspective. </p>

<p>The silent “majority” is being silenced. Go back to parler for as long as it lasts, then you can go back to sitting outside Cracker Barrel.</p>

<div class="md"><p>I&#39;m going to give you your answer so you can&#39;t claim nobody could/would provide one. Reddit is who. This website has detailed information about which subs and posts you visit, which links you click and where, when and on what you vote. If there&#39;s a link in one sub to a post or comment in another sub, they can see how many people click it, and what actions those people then take. The amount of information websites collect on their users is staggering. Many will go so far as to track every movement of your mouse on their site.</p>

<div class="md"><p>You swine. You vulgar little maggot. You worthless bag of filth. I wager you couldn&#39;t empty a boot of excrement were the instructions on the heel. You are a canker. A sore that won&#39;t go away. I would rather kiss a lawyer than be seen with you. Try to edit your responses of unnecessary material before attempting to impress us with your insight. The evidence that you are a nincompoop will still be available to readers, but they will be able to access it more rapidly. You snail-skulled little rabbit. Would that a hawk pick you up, drive its beak into your brain, and upon finding it rancid set you loose to fly briefly before spattering the ocean rocks with the frothy pink shame of your ignoble blood. May you choke on the queasy, convulsing nausea of your own trite, foolish beliefs. You are weary, stale, flat and unprofitable. You are grimy, squalid, nasty and profane. You are foul and disgusting. You&#39;re a fool, an ignoramus. And what meaning do you expect your delusional self-important statements of unknowing, inexperienced opinion to have to us who think and reason? What fantasy do you hold that you would believe that your tiny-fisted tantrums would have more weight than that of a leprous desert rat, spinning rabidly in a circle, waiting for the bite of the snake? You are a waste of flesh. You have no rhythm. You are ridiculous and obnoxious. You are the moral equivalent of a leech. You are a living emptiness, a meaningless void. You are sour and senile. You are a disease, you puerile one-handed slack-jawed , drooling meatslapper. You smarmy lagerlout git. You bloody woofter sod. Bugger off, pillock. You grotty wanking oik artless base-court apple-john. You clouted boggish foot-licking twit. You dankish clack-dish plonker. You gormless crook-pated tosser. You churlish boil-brained clotpole ponce. You cockered bum-bailey poofter. You gob-kissing gleeking flap-mouthed coxcomb. You dread-bolted fobbing beef-witted clapper-clawed flirt-gill. You are a fiend and a coward, and you have bad breath. You are degenerate, noxious and depraved. I feel debased just for knowing you exist. I despise everything about you, and I wish you would go away. I cannot believe how incredibly stupid you are. I mean rock-hard stupid. Dehydrated-rock-hard stupid. Stupid so stupid that it goes way beyond the stupid we know into a whole different dimension of stupid. You are trans-stupid stupid. Meta-stupid. Some pure essence of a stupid so uncontaminated by anything else as to be beyond the laws of physics that we know. I&#39;m sorry. I can&#39;t go on. This is an epiphany of stupid for me. After this, you may not hear from me again for a while. I don&#39;t have enough strength left to deride your ignorant questions and half-baked comments about unimportant trivia, or any of the rest of this drivel. Duh. I mean, really, stringing together a bunch of insults among a load of babbling was hardly effective. True, these are rudimentary skills that many of us &#39;normal&#39; people take for granted that everyone has an easy time of mastering. But we sometimes forget that there are &#39;challenged&#39; persons in this world who find these things more difficult. If I had known, that this was your case then I would have never read your post. It just wouldn&#39;t have been &#39;right&#39;. Sort of like parking in a handicap space. I wish you the best of luck in the emotional, and social struggles that seem to be placing such a demand on you. You&#39;re an idiot. A moron of the highest order. You&#39;re so stupid it&#39;s a wonder and a pity you can remember to breath. Intelligent ideas bounce off your head as if it were coated with teflon. Creative thoughts take alternate transportation in order to avoid even being in the same state as you. If you had an original thought it would die of loneliness before the hour was out. On an intelligence scale of 1 to 10 (10 corresponding to the highest attainable IQ) you&#39;re rating is so far into negative numbers that one would need to travel into another quantum reality in order to even catch a distant glimpse of it. Your personality is that of a rabid Chihuahua intent on destroying its own tail. Your powers of observation are akin to those of the bird that keeps slamming into the picture window trying to get that other bird it keeps seeing. You are walking, talking proof that you don&#39;t have to be sentient to survive, and that Barnum was thinking of you when he uttered his immortal phrase regarding the birth of a sucker. You are, at varying times, tedious, boring, and even occasionally earth shatteringly hilarious in your idiocy, routinely childish, moronic, pathetic, wretched, disgusting and pitiful. You are wholly without any redeeming social grace or value. If God ever decides to give the planet an enema you&#39;d better run like the wind because anywhere you stand is a suitable place for The Insertion. There is no animal so disgusting, so vile that it deserves comparison to you, for even the lowest, dirtiest, most parasitic member of the animal kingdom fills an ecological niche. You fill no niche. To call you a parasite would be injurious and defamatory to the thousands of honest parasitic species. You are worse than vermin, for vermin do not pretend to be what it is not. You are truly human garbage. You are a fraudulent, lying, predatory charlatan. You are of less worth than a burnt-out light bulb. You will forever live in shame. You have nothing to say, and Godwin&#39;s Law does not apply when writing about you. You are the anti-Midas, for all that you touch becomes valueless and unusable. Mothers gather their children close when you appear. You are an aberration, a corruption, and a boil that needs to be lanced. You are a poison in need of being vomited. You are a tooth so rotten it infects the whole body. You are sperm that should have been captured in a condom and flushed down a toilet. I don&#39;t like you. I don&#39;t like anybody who has as little respect for others as you do. Go away, you swine. You&#39;re a putrescent mass, a walking vomit. You are a spineless little worm deserving nothing but the profoundest contempt. You are a jerk, a cad, and a weasel. Your life is a monument to stupidity. You are a stench, a revulsion, a big suck on a sour lemon. You are a curdled staggering mutant dwarf smeared richly with the effluvia and offal accompanying your alleged birth into this world. Meaningful to no one, abandoned by the puke-drooling, giggling beasts that sired you and then killed themselves in recognition of what they had done. I will never get over the embarrassment of belonging to the same species as you. You are a monster, an ogre, a malformity. I wretch at the very thought of you. You have all the appeal of a paper cut. Lepers avoid you. You are vile, worthless, less than nothing. You are a weed, a fungus, and the dregs of this earth. And did I mention you smell? Monkeys look down on you. Even sheep won&#39;t have sex with you. You are unreservedly pathetic, starved for attention, and lost in a land that reality forgot. You are a waste of flesh. On a good day you&#39;re a halfwit. You are deficient in all that lends character. You have the personality of wallpaper. You are dank and filthy. You are asinine and benighted. You are the source of all unpleasantness. You spread misery and sorrow wherever you go. You are a fiend and a coward, and you have bad breath. You are degenerate, noxious and depraved. I feel debased just for knowing you exist. I despise everything about you, and I wish you would go away. I cannot believe how incredibly stupid you are. The only thing worse than your logic is your manners. Maybe later in life, after you have learned to read, write, study, spell, and count, you will have more success. True, these are rudimentary skills that many of us &#39;normal&#39; people take for granted that everyone has an easy time of mastering. It just wouldn&#39;t have been &#39;right&#39;.

You are hypocritical, greedy, violent, malevolent, vengeful, cowardly, deadly, mendacious, meretricious, loathsome, despicable, belligerent, opportunistic, barratrous, contemptible, criminal, fascistic, bigoted, racist, sexist, avaricious, tasteless, idiotic, brain-damaged, imbecilic, insane, arrogant, deceitful, demented, lame, self-righteous, byzantine, conspiratorial, satanic, fraudulent, libellous, bilious, splenetic, spastic, ignorant, clueless, illegitimate, harmful, destructive, dumb, evasive, double-talking, devious, revisionist, narrow, manipulative, paternalistic, fundamentalist, dogmatic, idolatrous, unethical, cultic, diseased, suppressive, controlling, restrictive, malignant, deceptive, dim, crazy, weird, dystrophic, stifling, uncaring, plantigrade, grim, unsympathetic, jargon-spouting, censorious, secretive, aggressive, mind-numbing, abrasive, poisonous, flagrant, self-destructive, abusive, and socially-retarded. Shut up and go away lest you achieve the physical retribution your behaviour merits.</p>

<p>In other words, ENJOY HAVING YOUR SHITTY ANTIVAX SUBREDDIT BANNED LMAOOOOOO</p>

Calling them rat plague, killers and what not. you all really look like a bunch of messed up nazis. Left or right, same shit. All talk, no rock.

<div class="md"><p>go back to sleep already, you can google it all yourself.. to be precise, it&#39;s corporatism that you fell for. Corporate fascism or Corporatism.  </p>

<p>Corporatism is a collectivist political ideology that advocates the organization of society by corporate groups, such as agricultural, labour, military, business, scientific, or guild associations, on the basis of their common interests.</p>

<div class="md"><p>There is never a time in history where censorship has been the answer to either disinformation or misinformation. The fact that competing arguments are being silenced instead of openly challenged on their merits is literally the antithesis to science. Moreover, it LEADS people to believe that something shady is going on. Cv-19 censorship is ENHANCING not ameliorating vaccine hesitancy. This is the same principle as blowback, wherein you play a massive role in radicalizing people that otherwise are not radicals. This is a very dangerous slippery slope you are going down because one day information you know to be correct will be silenced and then you will have to ask yourself, who is the arbiter? Who is making these decisions on what is or isn’t misinformation? History is going to remember your misdeeds, lest we all find ourselves chained to the walls of a gulag. Don’t be like other Big Tech technocracies that end up operating in an echo chamber. If an idea is bunk then debunk it. Trying to hide it just makes it seem like you are trying to have a monopoly on information.</p>

<p>The accurate summation would be &quot;While the principals of free speech, free expression of ideals, the regulation of misinformation, and the desire to stop hate speech all have their own merits, how we prioritize them is based on profitability.&quot; The admins care about two things above all else: advertisers and investors. They don&#39;t give a shit about anything that happens on the site until it starts getting bad press, or they think that banning a sub will attract more investment money than they&#39;d lose in web traffic money. Hell, look at <a href="/r/watchpeopledie">/r/watchpeopledie</a>: the subreddit was permabanning and reporting to the admins anyone who shared the NZ mosque shooting footage, but because news sites were running articles saying &quot;<a href="/r/watchpeopledie">/r/watchpeopledie</a> is sharing the shooting footage,&quot; the admins banned that sub at the speed of light.</p>

<p>No, because a user has to abide by the REDDIT Terms of Use which state what a user can and cannot do. Reddit as a company is free to impose any guidelines and restrictions it wants because <em>YOU</em> are not being forced to use reddit, and can walk away.</p>

<p>The moderators of <a href="/r/TheDonald">r/TheDonald</a> and <a href="/r/NoNewNormal">r/NoNewNormal</a> have frequently skirted around those terms to solidify their echo chamber of not only misinformation, but harmful misinformation, which is a hazard to the community as a whole.</p>

<p>I&#39;m not affiliated with reddit, but it&#39;s real simple why TD and NNN were banned.</p>

<p>Sure, I agree. People should be able to debate if a hotdog is a sandwich. But &quot;COVID is a lie and the vaccine will kill you to thin world population&quot; isn&#39;t an unpopular opinion, its a blatantly false statement.</p>

<div class="md"><p>The linked paper (not yet peer reviewed) does not suggest that getting the vaccine is a bad idea. </p>

<p>After getting the vaccine you can still get COVID but you’ll be more likely to stay alive and have less severe symptoms (a win). If you die it doesn’t really matter what your immunity would have been afterwards. All those people are inherently excluded from this study. Similarly if the second time you get COVID you have more minor systems that’s great! But it doesn’t mean the symptoms the first time around don’t count. We know vaccines can help with first time infection systems. Natural immunity from prior infection inherently cannot.</p>

<p>Keep in mind the comparison groups should be</p>

<ul>
<li>  Immunity after infection (no vaccine)</li>
<li>  Immunity after infection (with vaccine)</li>
</ul>

<p>And separately :</p>

<ul>
<li>  immunity with no prior infection (no vaccine)</li>
<li>  immunity with no prior infection (with vaccine)</li>
</ul>

<p>This paper compares immunity between of</p>

<ul>
<li>  Immunity after infection (no vaccine)</li>
<li>  immunity with no prior infection (with vaccine)</li>
</ul>

<p>Which is interesting and good for scientists to better understand COVID but doesn’t mean anything regarding whether people should get vaccinated.</p>

<p>Edit: in response to the OP’s Edit. I would like to say that yes lockdowns have lots of negative impacts. That’s why it’s great we have a vaccine, we just need more people to take it. I hope we expanded mandatory vaccine “passport” enforcement to all indoor public spaces (gyms, restaurants, etc.) rather than have more lockdowns.</p>

<div class="md"><p>Before the edit it was just one link and it could cause uninformed people to doubt the value of the vaccine. Unfortunately you can’t just ignore misinformation and hope it doesn’t sway people. </p>

<p>The edit link spamming can all be nicely summed up as lockdowns have negative impacts along with the positive impacts of limiting COVID spread. This isn’t new information and I can at least respect the different people value the pros and cons of lockdowns differently and may come to different conclusions than myself. However, now that we have a vaccine I’m firmly in the anti-lockdown, pro-mandatory vaccine in public spaces camp. You can be anti lockdown and pro vaccine.</p>

<div class="md"><p>I&#39;m a physician currently working in a COVID ICU (Technically it is a post-surgical ICU, but most of our patients are COVID at this point because the medical ICUs ran out of beds and we are postponing all but the most critical surgeries at this time because we have nowhere to put post-surgical patients). You can absolutely still get COVID after getting the vaccine, but the severity is markedly less. </p>

<p>At our hospital, 8/10 admitted patients are unvaccinated. 9/10 patients who require ICU-level care are unvaccinated. Greater than 9/10 patients (almost 95%) requiring ventilators are unvaccinated. Of those who ARE vaccinated and are admitted to the ICU, 2/3 are immunocompromised. This is completely preventable. Misinformation is literally killing people, and making this whole thing drag out far longer than it needs to. </p>

<p>Bonus anecdotal experience here: when the vaccine became available in December, our department was somehow overlooked as part of the &quot;first wave&quot; to get the vaccines. The delay ended up only being 2-3 days, but there was so much fury about being passed over, that talk of strike and walking out was thrown around before administration got their act together. Think about that--you can&#39;t GIVE these vaccines away right now, but among the people who know the most about the human body, scientific method, adverse reactions, and COVID in general, we were practically trampling each other to get the vaccine.  That should tell you something.</p>

<div class="md"><p>the interesting part is, if you exit the reddit echo chamber and talk to people in the real world, most of them are anti-lockdown, anti-mandates, but pro-vax. it&#39;s only on reddit that if you say <em>anything</em> against the covid narrative people think you&#39;re anti-vax or a trumper. reddit has gotten way worse over recent years, Ive been lurking on another account since &#39;09.</p>

<p>the downvote system used to not even be used for disagreements, but for people who aren&#39;t actually contributing to discussion. reddit has become twitter 2.0, an echo chamber for entitled people who actually have time to spend on it, which most people with struggling lives don&#39;t. I know so many people whose lives have been absolutely destroyed financially from covid, several families I know have had to move in with other families. reddit doesn&#39;t care. they&#39;ll bunch you all in with anti-vaxxers and karens if you say anything slightly ridiculing covid regulations. its fucking crazy. bring on those downvotes :)</p>

<div class="md"><p>No one is saying you can&#39;t criticise lockdowns</p>

<p>But do you know what the best way to prevent lockdowns are....... Vaccines</p>

<p>Unless your plan is to have no lockdowns, let everyone get covid so they have &quot;natural immunity&quot;</p>

<p>And then just completely ignore the hundreds of thousands of deaths and the complete overwhelming of all public health facilities?</p>

<div class="md"><p>It does spread a bit faster inherently because the vaccine makes you asymptotic. The problem is that the people who don’t get vaccines get infected and take up all the hospital beds for practically no reason and end up indirectly killing a lot of people there. If everyone gets a vaccine, then covid would just be at the level of a cold with the VERY occasional hospitalization (which is manageable).</p>

<div class="md"><p>Then the vaccinated have nothing to worry about if it’s a vast majority of the unvaccinated that are dying. So, why is the argument always used that unvaccinated people are putting them at risk? Apparently that’s not the case, according to your unsourced claim.</p>

<p>And the point of all those articles and statistics is to prove how dramatic and overblown the response to this virus was. But go on and assume the greater good to saving a few from covid means the rest of society has to suffer too.</p>

<p>Because unvaccinated people who get the virus and get taken to the limited ICU beds are blocking these very beds for other people with different severe conditions (unrelated to covid). These poor people can&#39;t get the treatment they need and are more likely to die because of it.</p>

<li><p>Vaccination reduces the chance for the virus to mutate. If the virus was able to mutate at a high rate, it would only be a matter of time before it mutated to the point where vaccines were ineffective. It could also mutate to become more contagious and more deadly (which has already happened to an extent with the delta variant).

<li><p>Some people who are at most at risk from COVID, would <em>like</em> to get vaccinated, but can’t. They rely on those around them not giving them the disease. And the vaccine reduces transmission rates by over half, even in those where it doesn’t prevent infection completely.</p></li>

<div class="md"><p>A hot dog is a sandwich. I’ve had this debate many times. There’s plenty of sandwiches that don’t have their bread cut at the end, like subs. The component of bread necessarily means it isn’t a taco. Nobody would argue a taco with a bread shell is a taco. A taco is defined by its tortilla. Even if you put meat between two unconnected tortillas it isn’t considered a sandwich.</p>

<div class="md"><p>Neither? It depends on what&#39;s inside. If you take a tortilla, put a full chorizo inside, and top it with mustard and relish, sure, I&#39;ll let you call that a hot dog. But if you take a beef frankfurter, grind up the meat, and garnish with  shredded lettuce and sour cream, then brother, that&#39;s a taco.</p>

<p>The definition of a food is way more complex than simply the shape it&#39;s in. Paella and jambalaya are different foods, despite both being mixes of meat/fish, rice, vegetables, stock, and seasoning.</p>

<div class="md"><p>A good proportion of the subreddit were vaccinated though, and just discussing the downsides of lockdowns or the effectiveness of mask mandates.</p>

<p>It&#39;s a shame to see this censorship applauded, to quote &amp;TOTSE:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Q: What is TOTSE all about, anyway?</p>

<p>A: A lot of people have some weird idea that this web site is a Bad Place, a place for hackers, software pirates, and anarchists. The reason that they think this is that there are informational text files on here about hacking, piracy, and anarchy.</p>

<p>However, there are also text files on here that discuss politics; democratic, right wing, left wing, libertarian, communist, and everything in between, but this is not a political web site.</p>

<p>There are files on here that discuss Jesus Christ, Muhammed, Buddha, Crowley, John Smith, and &quot;Bob&quot;, but this is not a religious web site.</p>

<p>There are files full of short stories, science fiction, humorous articles, and great works of literature, but this is not a literary web site.</p>

<p>There are files with information on rocketry, radio broadcasting, chemistry, electronics, genetics, and computers, but this is not a technical web site.</p>

<p>This web site is about INFORMATION. All sorts and all viewpoints. Some of the information you will agree with, some you will find shocking, and some you will probably disagree with violently. That is the whole point. In this society we go to schools where there is one right answer: The Teacher&#39;s. There is one acceptable version of events: The Television&#39;s. There is only one acceptable occupation: The pursuit of money. There is only one political choice to make: The Status Quo.</p>

<p>On this web site you are expected to make decisions all by yourself. You get to decide who and what to agree with, and why. You get to hear new viewpoints that you may have never heard before. On this web site people exist without age, without skin color, without gender, without clothes, without nationality, without any of the visual cues we usually use to discredit or ignore people who are unlike ourselves. All of these things are stripped away and the ideas themselves are laid bare.</p>

<p>You will change. You will transform. You will learn. You will disagree.</p>

<p>You will enjoy it.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I&#39;m not even American, my country has never had mask mandates or lockdown at all. Yet I am banned from subreddits for mentioning that, or that I agree with my own government? It&#39;s complete madness.</p>

<p>I was banned from <a href="/r/news">/r/news</a> for saying that Ivermectin is a safe drug. Which it is, it’s pretty harmless.</p>

<p>Places that have taken stances against misinformation like Twitter, the AP, YouTube have not just gotten it wrong— like with the Lab Leak Theory— but have gone so far as to remove Senate testimonies discussing certain topics.</p>

<p>This is a really questionable idea— that these media companies can accurately and unbiasedly identify medical “misinformation”. But you guys are boiling it down into something as simple as finding and removing falsifiable lies.</p>

<p>The context is clear. It was the story about a doctor prescribing an admitted ICU patient IVM.</p>

<p>The person I responded to said it was dangerous and I corrected them. IVM is not going to harm them.</p>

<p>If somebody reads that comment and runs off to the feed store that&#39;s not my problem. We&#39;re moving into La La Land levels of caution.</p>

<div class="md"><p>If you want to be shielded from “blatantly false opinions” it’s rather simple - don’t look at the Reddit in question. The reality is you have a nasty, tyrannical, moralistic streak and you need everyone else to conform to your subscribed groupthink.</p>

<p>Next you’ll have an issue with anyone questioning the official narrative around 9.11, or conversations regarding potential voting fraud, or the right to protest during lockdowns, or scientific questions regarding the isolation of viruses, or alternative healthcare - because all of these can be painted as “dangerous” and “obviously wrong” by you. The fact that your opinion is literally of no interest or consequence to these communities just makes you angry.</p>

<p>How about you stop infringing into other peoples’ freedoms with your fears. Know yourself and be respectful to others, whether they agree with you or not.</p>

<p>That’s just not true. People believe misinformation when it’s given as fact (like it was in NNN) all the time</p>

<p>That’s the point, we don’t care if someone <em>believes</em> something bizarre, but we do care if they are telling other people that it is true - blatant misinformation</p>

<p>“But the reality is, there are doctors and scientists and evidence that back everything NNN was about, and people don&#39;t want to hear it because it contradicts their own bias and beliefs.”</p>

<div class="md"><p>One of the most deeply unsettling trends of late has been people leaning into the idea that there is no objective truth that can be discerned, or even worse, that people are allowed to have their own alternative truths and that no one &quot;truth&quot; should be considered to be correct. If, say, two people have a conversation, and one insists that the actor who played Bruce Wayne in Christopher Nolan&#39;s Dark Knight Trilogy is Danny DeVito, that person is wrong.</p>

<p>Of course, it&#39;s easy to make the argument that people are allowed to be <em>wrong</em>, and that especially in the event that a person is simply mistaken, people shouldn&#39;t just be banned for being wrong. (After all, we all know how much Danny DeVito and Christian Bale look alike.) You might even say if a whole community that happens to be wrong, they still shouldn&#39;t face any consequences for it, even if they&#39;re provably, objectively wrong.</p>

<p>But the question is, where is the <em>harm being done</em> in someone&#39;s mistaken belief that Danny DeVito played Batman? Sure, maybe Christian Bale&#39;s ego might be hurt - we can&#39;t all look as good as Danny DeVito - but no one is truly harmed by that. But when it comes to people arguing that covid is a hoax, or that it&#39;s no worse than the flu, or that the vaccine isn&#39;t safe, or that masks don&#39;t work, or - honestly there&#39;s too much disinformation to cover all of it. The point is, that sort of incorrect information isn&#39;t the sort of harmless &quot;Danny DeVito played Batman&quot; falsehood. It&#39;s medical disinformation that often poses a specific risk to people who believe it, because people who believe these things are more likely to act in a way that carries significant risk towards both their health and the health of those around them.</p>

<p>I believe in free speech. I also understand that reddit, as a private company, is not strictly obligated to allow the existence of any community they don&#39;t want. The idea that there should be some sort of line drawn between two extremes always gets pushback, because people love to make the all-or-nothing argument that if we allow some communities to be removed for falsehoods, where will it end? Who&#39;s to stop reddit from removing any community that they simply disagree with?</p>

<p>Provably false medical disinformation that encourages people to engage in risky or harmful behavior towards the health and safety of themselves or others is, in my opinion, a perfectly fine line to draw. Danny DeVito can live on as the caped crusader in all our hearts, and anti-vaxxers can fuck off. Win-win in my book.</p>

<div class="md"><p>everyone has known since very early on that the severity of covid varies person to person. </p>

<p>you&#39;re basically saying &quot;I was in a car accident and was fine, don&#39;t know why anyone wears a seatbelt&quot; when car accidents can happen anywhere from 1 mph to 100. </p>

<p>the differing &quot;speeds&quot; of collision are basically equivalent to different viral loads* of covid. </p>

<p>and as always, comorbidities are a thing. if you&#39;re a fat asthmatic with a history of smoking you&#39;re gonna have a much worse time with covid than someone who isn&#39;t all those things, all else being equal.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.webmd.com/lung/covid-viral-load#1">https://www.webmd.com/lung/covid-viral-load#1</a></p>

<blockquote>
<p>*The short answer seems to be yes. The seriousness of symptoms from viral infections is often due directly to the amount of the virus that gets into your body. In addition, studies on two previous coronaviruses (SARS and MERS) showed people exposed to higher loads got sicker.</p>

<div class="md"><p>So....you made what sounds like a ridiculous claim of how people are acting, and refuse to back that up?  If this is such a big issue, this should be simple enough to dig up.</p>

<p>If you&#39;re claiming this is happening, I can&#39;t be the only person who asked you to point them towards it happening.  Should be simply enough to have something put together and you can give everyone the same answer.</p>

<p>To be clear, if people are claiming there&#39;s no such thing as break-through cases, they&#39;re nuts.  The vaccines are designed to greatly reduce the chance of catching it and, if you do catch it, greatly reduce the chance of getting a case which puts you in the hospital.  There&#39;s also Delta and other potential variants which the vaccine does less against.</p>

<p>Now, that said, if it&#39;s in response to someone claiming the vaccines do nothing or don&#39;t work, and you&#39;re taking that as &quot;people claiming break-through cases don&#39;t happen,&quot; then what you&#39;re claiming is disingenuous.  If that&#39;s not what happened, then linking what did happen will bolster your point.</p>

<div class="md"><p>You and another redditor&#39;s interaction doesn&#39;t translate into proof just because they dont speak to you in a way you deem unfavorable.  In the real world we call that false equivalence. </p>

<p>In its simplest form, you literally want the right to say anything you want to sway opinion in your favor, without dealing with the responsibility of what comes of your claims.   This is straight fact regardless of whether your claims are true or not.</p>

<p>Having to back your statements with proof is a part of being an adult, which is why learning how to cite sources is taught in school..... </p>

<div class="md"><p>I’m a mod on <a href="/r/lockdownskepticism">r/lockdownskepticism</a>. You’re incorrect, the purpose of the sub is only to examine the human rights aspect of lockdowns, something that has been sorely missed from the conversation. People like you have no idea the mental health issues people have come to us with and the amount of people that have used our sub as a lifeline. We do not allow conspiracy theories, misinformation, partisanship, covid denial, or anti-vax content, as you can see in our sidebar, and we do not allow claims to be made without the proper evidence. We have also hosted a number of experts in both medicine and other fields related to the pandemic, people whom are extremely reputable individuals in their fields. Amongst these we’ve have a Harvard medical doctor, an Oxford scientist, epidemiologists, human rights experts, attorneys involved with covid related cases, and more. </p>

<p>And more importantly, we have no affiliation with <a href="/r/NoNewNormal">r/NoNewNormal</a>. That sub was purposely removed from our sidebar over a year ago because of conspiracy theories, partisanship, and generally bad behaviour on this site.</p>

<p>Edit: People are not attempting to use this to debate the merits of lockdowns with me in the comments. I’m not doing that anymore and accusing people of killing others because of their views is so April 2020, not to mention reminiscint of the McCarthy era (and absurd as I’m vaccinated lol). If you want my views, see the pinned posts on my profile, but I’m not here to debate them. I’m here to clear up OP’s misconception about the content of the subreddit.</p>

<div class="md"><p>I will admit I may have judged your subreddit too harshly based on about 10 minutes of looking.</p>

<p>For what it&#39;s worth, I wholeheartedly agree that people need to consider the negative impact of lockdowns on individuals and society.

<p>That being said, when one of your users shares an open letter from mental health professionals advocating for children wearing masks, and they flair it as &quot;Dystopia&quot;... I&#39;ll be honest, it comes off a tad tin-foil hat.</p>

<div class="md"><p>I see where you’re coming from. We actually banned all mask discussion for a while and only reversed that due to mask policies changing (or not) with increased vaccination. The dystopia flair perhaps isn’t the most appropriate for that article, I’d have gone with “lockdown concerns,” but at the same time I understand how parents in particular can feel that way. I myself am not particularly psyched about having to wear a mask to postgrad even though I’m vaccinated, but that’s fairly low on my personal list of concerns re: lockdowns.</p>

<div class="md"><p>Thanks for standing up for what is right. It’s crazy how they’re trying to censor legitimate debates about whether lockdowns are good for society.

<p>Oh trust me, I know that moderation is voluntary and users reporting things is extremely useful to get stuff seen. I mod two subreddits, one about your size, the other ~50% larger. Both have much smaller mod teams, and things do occasionally get through. </p>

<p>However, at an absolute minimum, it&#39;s quite troubling that apparently nobody in your community felt any of these comments were worth reporting, <em>or</em> challenging with comments of their own. Apparently most of your readers don&#39;t see any issue with that.</p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>COVID wasn&#39;t a real pandemic, the CDC director is a puppet for Big Pharma, &quot;they&quot; will prevent you from ever seeing your family again. Yeah, that all sounds legit. </p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>I&#39;m looking at this from the perspective of someone who lost their job to the pandemic and had considerable trouble replacing it, was unable to branch out and socialize living in a new place, didn&#39;t see my family in person for well over a year, and had my share of mental health issues that sure as shit weren&#39;t helped by work, pandemic, and isolation related stresses. </p>

<p>Let me say this in the nicest possible way: This pandemic ran as long as it did, killed as many people as it did, and will continue to run longer and kill more because of exactly the kind of people who use your sub as a safehouse and proving ground of arguments that will get others killed. </p>

<p>If you want to run a serious, well moderated debate sub on a topic as lethally significant as this, you and your teammates need to seriously step up on making sure your subreddit really is what you claim it&#39;s supposed to be. Because right now, you&#39;ve clearly fallen short.</p>

<div class="md"><p>Just want to applaud your patience and responses here. I was supportive of lockdowns / restrictions / super happy enforced &#39;home time&#39;, whatever you want to call it, back in April of 2020 - there was just so much we didn&#39;t know, our treatment protocols for infected individuals were rudimentary, no contact tracing, no testing infrastructure, no vaccines. Lockdowns were about all we could do - and since we didn&#39;t know how it spread (indoor vs. outdoor, contact vs. aerosols, etc), they made sense.</p>

<p>But the science has evolved significantly since then. Our treatments have improved. Masks, social distancing, and proper ventilation have been shown to be highly effective at reducing spread in indoor locations, and outdoor locations are essentially a non-issue. Vaccination rates are pretty decent (could be better), and it does feel good knowing that my family and I (but for my young children, who are also low risk) are all vaccinated and relatively safe from serious harm.</p>

<p>People still calling for lockdowns aren&#39;t following the science any longer, imho. And many Redditors who are supporters of the lockdown mentality are probably either 1) collecting generous unemployment or 2) working a job where they can work from home. The lack of regard for people who would have their livelihoods ruined by another lockdown is so apparent, as they brush off concerns about those impacts as &quot;iT&#39;s jUsT tHe EcOnOmY!!!&quot;. Your statement that economy = lives and livelihoods is very well stated.</p>

<p>Anyway, just wanted to offer you some support, as I saw you were getting pretty attacked by some particularly aggressive pro-super-happy-enforced-home-time Redditors.</p>

<div class="md"><p>Thanks! Believe me it’s much appreciated. Yeah, I feel like a lot of people associate the economy with rich corporate people on Wall Street, but it affects all of us and is partially responsible for our well being too (not to mention there was a correlation in my city between lower income individuals and covid deaths). But yeah, it’s just weird to see some of the points from April 2020 still being made when we 1) have the vaccine and 2) the vaccines are available in most first world places now (which, let’s face it, most of reddit lives in). As you said, outdoors was known to be a non issue and I honestly thought last fall we’d have indoor classes again with masks and distancing (not a fan of masks personally, but not really a big objection of mine, and whatever ends lockdowns tbh, although maybe I’d feel differently if wearing one was more uncomfortable for me).</p>

<p>But thanks for the kind words. I mostly made my initial post because I didn’t want people lumping us in with NNN. Admittedly I wasn’t a big fan, a lot of people there made me feel bad for being left wing, but I think Reddit’s reasoning is dodgy here since they’re annoyingly vague.</p>

<p>The two pinned posts on your profile are impressively long, but boil down to a simple conclusion: Your freedom to socialize is more valuable than the lives of others.

<div class="md"><p>No, I believe in cost-benefit analysis. The costs of lockdowns outweigh any benefits, which are pretty much nonexistent when you look at the data (lockdown doesn’t correlate with fewer deaths). You’re also making the same false assumption that it’s only about socialisation. Yes, the ability to socialise is important for mental and therefore physical health, but the biggest costs are things like the <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/2020/09/25/pandemic-pushes-hundreds-millions-people-toward-starvation-poverty/">100 million people starving thanks to this</a>.</p>

<div class="md"><p>Your entire sub is a joke in the first place. Practically nowhere on earth has actually had a &quot;lockdown&quot; since the pandemic began.

For many people, <del>lockdowns</del> <em>restrictions</em> mean people can’t go to work, can’t see their dying family, can’t get cancer screenings, can’t even return home to their country in some cases. Hell, 100 million are projected to starve because of this. What is wrong with you that  you would say “oh, suck it up that you can’t go out and get a Big Mac?” THAT WAS NEVER THE OBJECTION.

<div class="md"><p>Is it? I&#39;m from the united states and it&#39;s not looking good. Has this person you know told you about their experience with being diagnosed? How are they treating it? I personally had 2 ER doctors that told me they didn&#39;t know what was causing my symptoms, which is fine, and then 2 GP&#39;s after that telling me that my symptoms are more than likely &quot;anxiety&quot; which I can promise you it is not. There&#39;s a lot of overlap with CFS, Lymes, Lupus and other autoimmune disorders and those groups are very much brushed under the rug. This is why <a href="/r/covidlonghaulers">/r/covidlonghaulers</a> is important in terms of advocacy in being heard, acknowledged and treated. </p>

<div class="md"><p>Exactly this. <a href="/r/covidlonghaulers">r/covidlonghaulers</a> is largely a place for people to share their personal experiences with long covid. We have some users, usually newer ones, who don&#39;t know how to speak properly about personal experiences and opinions, but even then we can have proper discussion about that.   </p>

<p>Moderation can be improved there if necessary but I dont believe the <em>intention</em> of these users or the mods is to support misinformation, its just immaturity in speaking about a complex issue. Which will always exist in social media.   </p>

<p>Regardless it&#39;s not even close to the purpose of other quarantined subs. I think there are a few other collateral damage quarantines here too but losing <a href="/r/covidlonghaulers">r/covidlonghaulers</a> would be a tragedy for our community.</p>

<p>You might imagine these to be editorial in nature; They are not.</p>

<p>Reddit does not permit some doxxing but ban others; They have a uniform rule that prohibits an entire class of <em>behaviour</em> - a <em>behaviour</em> which serves the illegitimate purpose of intimidation, threat, and chilling free speech.</p>

<p>Reddit does not permit some violent threats but disallow others; They uniformly disallow all viable violent threats - a <em>behaviour</em> which serves the illegitimate purpose of intimidation, threat, and chilling free speech.</p>

<p>Same with harassment - a <em>behaviour</em> which serves the illegitimate purpose of intimidation, threat, and chilling free speech.</p>

<p>CSAM is prohibited because of the federal legal status it exists under; It is an artifact of a crime.</p>

<p>In the eyes of the law, Reddit is not a publisher, and any assertion that they are a publisher is at best ignorant and at worst malicious. Reddit is a user-content-hosting computer services provider under the laws of the United States.</p>

<p>Nonsense. There is no universal definition for harrasment. They are actively making editorial decisions regarding what content counts as harrassment.</p>

<p>Additionally, due to obscure content-voting algorithms, they are deliberately <em>choosing</em> what content to show to users. Just like Facebook.</p>

<p>They are making editorial decisions. They are a publisher. This is clear and obvious.</p>

<p>Medical information is pretty black and white. Take the whole ivermectin thing for instance. I&#39;ll give you some real phrases I&#39;ve seen on Reddit as examples:</p>

<p>&quot;we need to investigate ivermectin for potential COVID therapy&quot; - opinion and totally fine, not trying to definitively state whether ivermectin is or is not a potential cure</p>

<p>&quot;ivermectin cures COVID and possibly even cancer, AIDS, and the flu&quot; - misinformation. Stating falsehoods as facts even though scientific evidence does not support it, or in some cases disproves it.</p>

<p>&quot;ivermectin has no use as an antiviral&quot; - misinformation. The jury is out</p>

<p>&quot;You should buy ivermectin at the farm supply store because big pharma won&#39;t give it to you because they&#39;re run by the demonic cabal&quot; - misinformation and clearly very dangerous.</p>

<p>I hope this cleared it up for you.</p>

<div class="md"><p>The &quot;Reddit shutters subreddits hosting violent tortious behaviours &amp; crimes only when journalistic coverage of the phenomenon occurs&quot; phenomenon is not strictly one of editorial choice; It is a phenomenon of being (or rather, <em>not</em> being) a party to tortious or criminal liability.</p>

<p>Reddit operates with relative freedom from liability for the nature of the content hosted on the service <strong>only so long as employees with the power to exercise agency on behalf of the corporation remain ignorant of the nature of the content</strong>.</p>

<p>The Reddit User Agreement goes to great lengths to disclaim responsibility for the nature of the content on the service and to assign all responsibility for the nature of the content to the person who uploads it to Reddit.</p>

<p>Because of the peculiarities of the laws of the US, when a journal of record publishes a major article &quot;<a href="/r/hypotheticalsubreddit">/r/hypotheticalsubreddit</a> hosts conspiracy to assassinate US politicians&quot;, detailing the posts and users involved, the executives of Reddit - who have agency on behalf of the corporation - are thereby reasonably known to have reliable knowledge of the nature of the content of that hypothetical subreddit.</p>

<p>If they get subpoenaed, they cannot reliably testify &quot;I had no knowledge of this happening&quot;, because it was front page news in their local newspaper, and their legal department had been contacted by the journalist for comment on the story before it was published.</p>

<p>So with that phenomenon, it&#39;s not a case of editorial agency, but one of executive, fiscal and corporate-responsibility agency.</p>

<div class="md"><p>That&#39;s true; It&#39;s also true that Reddit can be made to sit through a long, expensive trial to determine whether Section 230 exemptions should apply when they know about the content and behaviour yet do nothing about it, and whether or not a <em>reasonable person</em> would consider that a reasonable and tenable state of affairs.</p>

<p>With Section 230, if a single user-content-hosting ISP has to deal with an expensive discovery process and pretrial and trial and an out-of-court seettlement, that&#39;s a ding on their balance sheet.</p>

<p>If a single user-content-hosting ISP has to deal with an expensive discovery process and pretrial and trial and the trial results in an appeal to the Ninth Circuit who remand back with instructions that neuter those Section 230 exemptions / protections for the given ISP, then the Ninth Circuit has done so for <em>all</em> user-content-hosting ISPs in the jurisdiction - which will affect the legal environment for all of them, potentially ending the run of smaller user-content-hosting ISPs including Reddit.</p>

<p>If they take appropriate steps to dis-associate themselves from the criminal enterprise at the earliest reasonable opportunity, then they can present that fact at pre-trial and ask for a dismissal of the case. That keeps forecastable legal costs flat.</p>

<p>He&#39;s a covid denier trying to portray a straw man.  Just look at his post history - he thinks the government is forcing vaccines on us to make money for big pharma, and hiding the truth about horse paste from us because they don&#39;t make money there.</p>

<div class="md"><p>Yep.  Like I told the anti-vaxxer, I&#39;ve been wishing we could do better about big pharma and healthcare in general in this country for a <em>long</em> time now.

<div class="md"><p>I didn&#39;t say you should throw away all scientific achievements, you&#39;re being disingenuous and putting words in my mouth. I&#39;m saying there&#39;s  a huge problem with replication, ghostwriting, insufficient peer review, conflict of interest, corporate funding that just simply appealing to &#39;peer reviewed science&#39; is foolish. You need rigorous assessment of the validity of a piece or field of research, not blind faith in a process that has serious documented problems. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>If you are saying that the whole process is flawed, just because some idiots cheat on their scientific papers, you&#39;re a moron.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Bud you have entities like the FDA telling Purdue that it&#39;s okay to call oxycontin not very addictive and failing to rectify it for over 5 years. Broken does not begin to describe it. If you trust regulatory agencies (which have been captured by the industries they are supposed to regulate) and large pharmaceutical companies (that have paid out the largest medical settlements in history and spend more than any other industry on lobbying) then good fucking luck. You better hope for good health and good doctors.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>You don&#39;t understand what ghostwriting is and what the extent of it is, and that&#39;s just one problem that medical journals face.</p>

<div class="md"><p>Last Saturday I blew Jake&#39;s horse for the first time and really liked it.
However, Jake took pictures and posted them on his website.  If I want to
keep it a secret I had to continue to cooperate with his wishes.</p>

<p>I was to go to Jake&#39;s place next Saturday and hoped that I would have a
chance to blow his horse once again.  It was completely perverted, but I
loved it!</p>

<p>I received an email mid-week telling me that I was to have two two-quart
enemas on Saturday morning to make sure I was completely cleaned out before
going to Jakes.  I expected that Jake wanted to fuck me, which was fine
with me.  I wasn&#39;t accustomed to enemas, but I didn&#39;t mind, as I
anticipated Jakes huge cock deep in me.</p>

<p>I arrived at Jake&#39;s which was a small ranch of about 10 acres, with a small
horse barn.  He took me out to the barn and took me to his horse.  The
horse recognized me, and I saw his cock enlarged in anticipation.</p>

<p>&quot;Go ahead and suck him,&quot; Jake said, &quot;but don&#39;t make him cum.&quot;</p>

<p>I knelt before him and sucked his cock, wanting to make him cum, but I was
still in my clothes.</p>

<p>&quot;That&#39;s enough,&quot; said Jake, &quot;you definitely got his interest, and he&#39;ll be
cumming soon.&quot;</p>

<p>Jake told me to take off my clothes, which I gladly did.  He told me to
lean over a bench and spread my legs.  He slipped a lubed finger up my ass
and then another, spreading his fingers to prep me for his big cock.</p>

<p>Slipping his fingers out, he pressed his cock head to my ass and gently
pushed into me.  I pushed back, as if taking a dump, and his head slipped
into me.  Jake was experienced in fucking white faggots, and he knew how to
slip his big cock in without pain.  Soon he slipped deeper and began
stroking in and out.  As I stood there, Jake fucked me relentlessly.</p>

<p>&quot;You got a really nice sissy ass!&quot; said Jake, and continued to plow me.
Soon he thrust deeply as he came and wrapped his arms around me, holding me
tight as he pumped his load out.</p>

<p>&quot;Now for the best part,&quot; said Jake, as he pulled out of my ass.  He told me
to remain there and soon I felt something hard pressing into my ass.  He
pressed it into me and I felt stretched more than I ever had been.</p>

<p>&quot;Just hold it there for awhile,&quot; said Jake.  He held the object in place
and stroked me cock, keeping me hard and interested.  After a time he told
me to stand up, which I did.  He led me over to his horse, holding the
large object to keep it from coming out.</p>

<p>Jake pulled the object out and showed it to me.  It was a full-sized
cucumber – no wonder I felt so stretched!</p>

<p>Jake told me to bend over and put my hands on my knees.  I felt something
warm on my asshole and realized that Jake was guiding his horse into me.</p>

<p>&quot;You can&#39;t let your horse fuck me!&quot; I declared, &quot;He&#39;ll kill me!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;He won&#39;t fuck you,&quot; said Jake, &quot;but his cock is in you and I&#39;ll be jacking
him off.  Just enjoy the fullness.&quot;</p>

<p>I felt the cock grow in me and it did feel really nice, but I wondered what
would happen when he came.  I remembered his cum shooting out of my mouth,
but with his cock buried in my ass his cum would probably fill my bowels –
that must be why Jake wanted me completely cleaned out.</p>

<p>I decided not to worry about it, but to just enjoy the moment.  The horse
cock in my ass was even more impressive than Jake and soon I felt the horse
pumping his huge load into me.  My belly cramped immediately and I cried
out, but then it subsided.  I just recieved a hot horse cum enema.  I was
hard as a rock but kind of scared as well.</p>

<p>I knew that the colon absorbed things very quickly and if there was
anything harmful in the horse cum that I might be in danger.</p>

<p>&quot;I have to clean this out!&quot; I said, and Jake took me to a water tap with a
short garden hose attached.  I turned it on slowly and put the end of the
hose up my ass.  After the stretching it went in very easily and I began to
fill with cold water.  The coldness made me shudder, but I endured in order
to clean out.</p>

<p>I removed the hose and went outside to expell.  I watched as the water and
horse cum mixture hit the ground.  When I had expelled all I could I
returned to the hose and filled up again.  After several repeats I was
finished.</p>

<p>I returned to find Jake and asked if he had taken more pictures.  He said
that he always did and hoped that I would like them.</p>

<p>&quot;While you are here, would you like to blow one of the other horses?&quot; Jake
asked.</p>

<p>&quot;Do you have any others that don&#39;t have a big flare?&quot; I asked.</p>

<p>&quot;I know just the one for you,&quot; said Jake, and led me to another horse.</p>

<p>This one was smaller, with a smaller cock, but without a noticable flare.
Jake took his spot at he head of the horse to calm him, while I knelt by
his cock and began to suck him.  While I was a very experience cocksucker,
blowing a horse was an taking it to a whole new level and I knew I needed
this regularly.  Soon the horse began pumping his hot load into my mouth,
spilling down my chest.  Like the other horse, it tasted much stronger than
human cum, but this time I didn&#39;t spit it all out.  I let the excess run
out of my mouth, but kept as much in my mouth as I could.  After he stopped
cumming I stood up with a mouthful of the strong cum.  I swallowed – it
was the biggest load I ever had swallowed, and that was just a small part
of his entire load.</p>

<p>Jake told me that I seemed to be really enjoying it, and it showed in my
work.  I went to the hose and washed the horse cum off my body, and dried
off.  I got dressed and told Jake that I had swallowed some of the horse
cum, and wondered if there was any danger.</p>

<p>&quot;All of my horses have been treated to eliminate any possible dangers in
their cum.  We have a vet who is very sympathetic to what we do here, so
you can swallow without danger.  There was no need to clean yourself out as
you did, but it made for good pictures just the same.</p>

<p>&quot;Shall I come back next Saturday?&quot; I asked.</p>

<p>&quot;Yes, and prep like you did today,&quot; said Jake, &quot;and you can retain the cum
next time.&quot;</p>

<p>I agreed and went home.  As I drove home, I resolved to swallow as much
horse cum as I could next time.  By the time I got home I had to jack off
immediately, aroused by all I had done!</p>

<div class="md"><p>You sounds EXACTLY like Joe Biden urging huge tech corporations that maintain a seemingly colluding monopoly on the free speech in the new public square of social media, to censor speech deemed &quot;misinformation&quot; ie goes against the ever changing state backed narrative on COVID-19.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS6Aw-hM190">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS6Aw-hM190</a></p>

<p>This is the same Joe Biden who said:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>There’s a simple, basic proposition: If you’re vaccinated, you’re not going to be hospitalized, you’re not going to be in an ICU unit, and you’re not going to die. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>That&#39;s very dangerous misinformation, right? We can all agree on that So why are you parroting this guy?</p>

<p>But EVEN the corporate backed &quot;fact checkers&quot; are lying and carrying water, by framing his statement as:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>&quot;You&#39;re not going to get COVID if you have these vaccinations,&quot; Biden said.</p>
</blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>oh that&#39;s NOT the argument he was making, as I just showed.  So I think your script isn&#39;t about &quot;misinformation&quot; at all, it&#39;s about a narrative.  And just like that, i&#39;ve just proven it.  There&#39;s no argument to be had.  you win in your effort to censor, but you&#39;ll always be wrong.  </p>

<p>You guys are just insufferable. Why do you take such pride in contributing to manslaughter?</p>

<p>How about you accept the fact that medicine is <em>not</em> politics and start listening to what the scientific community overwhelmingly agrees on, instead of entertainment news-channels and politicians?</p>

<blockquote>

<p>No, it may be an oversimplication, but it&#39;s obviously expressed in generic terms; For most people, it will absolutely be true. And even then, it&#39;s not <em>dangerous</em> misinformation to encourage vaccination, even though I agree the recommendation should be to continue to live carefully even afterwards.</p>

<p>A tiny number of people with serious side effects (an order of magnitude or two less chance of serious side effects/death than getting Covid) does not make the vaccine dangerous.</p>

<div class="md"><p>I know you have this perfect mindset of free exchange of ideas, where bad ideas can be combatted with better arguments. You couldn&#39;t have been paying attention the last 5 years. They don&#39;t accept new information and have way more time than others to keep parroting their ideas until everyone else is sick of arguing anymore and admits defeat. Giving crazies a soapbox gives way for more crazies, not less. Eventually they will be the majority and society will fall. We have to stop them before its too late at all costs.</p>

<p>Based on the current very low- to low-certainty evidence, we are uncertain about the efficacy and safety of ivermectin used to treat or prevent COVID-19.

<p>I don&#39;t see many people calling for a mandatory vaccination. The majority of people—myself included—are simply baffled over the fact that so many don&#39;t even want it.</p>

<p>And also help spread the virus exponentially further, statistically killing many people down the line.</p>

<p>And also contribute to the quickly mutating forms of virus that may end up more deadly and/or resistant to the vaccine.</p>

<p>And also take on the significantly higher risk of life-long disabilities.</p>

<div class="md"><p>Okay, aside from that incredibly specific and rare scenario (Covid deaths and injuries are extremely common), is the entire point or the official stance of any of the suggested subreddits that motorcycle riding is safe? Because the literal only point of many of these subreddits is misinformation. That&#39;s it, it&#39;s what they do.</p>

<p>And maybe if one of these motorcycle subs is doing that, they should be banned. That&#39;s a discussion we can have. How much is too much, how far is too far?</p>

<p>But the Covid misinformation subs are unquestionably a danger to society as a whole. They push people away from vaccination, away from real, safe treatments, and encourage taking oversized doses of medications that have little to no evidence of being in any way helpful without so much as a doctor helping ensure proper dosage.</p>

<p>You want the motorcycle subs looked at? Close down every single Covid misinformation subs first, that&#39;s undeniably the bigger threat, that&#39;s the first priority.</p>

<p>that&#39;s all i hear on reddit as an argument against those who want to remain unvaxxinated due to not having enough information to make an informed decision to consent to this trial.</p>

<p>yes the &quot;experts&quot; keep making blanket statements and then telling us later that they were wrong.  Science works when you have a hypothesis and you test it and say that you think something, but NOT when you tell people that everything that contradicts your hypothesis is anti-science.</p>

<p>Reddit can lie and claim that this is about brigading, and these corporate authoritarians will keep saying &quot;no, we want you to ban misinformation&quot;, but we all know that both of those groups are colluding and that the real misinformation is coming from the pro-censorship crowd.  They&#39;ve proven who they are again and again.  </p>

<p>Show us the rates of myocarditis and blood clots.  do the autopsies on the &quot;natural causes&quot; and &quot;accidents&quot;, and publish the data.  Stop calling people in the 14 day window or with 1 shot &quot;unvaxxinated&quot;.  Stop lying about unvaccinated people making up a small portion of hospitalizations.  Stop lying about treatments and acting like FDA approved medications are &quot;horse dewormers&quot;, or having to pull back your studies from the Lancet because you lied.  Stop publishing front page article on &quot;Masks work!&quot; when your standard is supposedly peer review.  </p>

<p>Aaron Schwartz rode on making the data open to all, and democracy does die in the darkness of the controlled corporate media.  Where&#39;s the fucking data!!!?  When someone calls for censorship of misinformation and you know they&#39;re on the side of limiting access to information, you tell them to shut up because they&#39;re liars and they ARE killing people.</p>

<div class="md"><p>Right? Especially since that excuse is a double standard, since <a href="/r/nonewnormal">/r/nonewnormal</a> was constantly brigaded by other subreddits.</p>

<p>Ban it for the right reasons or stay consistent.</p>

<div class="md"><p>As someone who only vaguely followed what was going on, it&#39;s disheartening that this doesn&#39;t address the larger context in which this happened. This post tried to sound like Reddit did some analysis and decided of it&#39;s own merit to take action. Even as someone only vaguely watching, that&#39;s blatantly untrue - it took a user revolt to force your hands.</p>

<p>I understand why Reddit might want to be a place for political debate, even if opinions being expressed are repugnant. But my understanding is that <a href="/r/nonewnormal">/r/nonewnormal</a> and <a href="/r/ivermectin">/r/ivermectin</a> are actively encouraging actions which are harmful (eg: taking medications off label or in potentially harmful doses).</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Are you planning to or will you consider banning or quarantining subs which frequently promote health mis/disinformation?</p></li>
<li><p>If not, will you consider labeling posts as potentially unverified or linking to trusted resources when certain keywords are used? Facebook does this and while I&#39;m not sure how effective it is, it may help when content is linked to from off-site or for anyone who might otherwise be inclined to trust the information.</p></li>
<li><p>It seems that a large part of the problem is when moderators allow content that should be banned by site-wide rules. This allows the formation of echo chambers where mis/disinformation can thrive. Do you have any plans for dealing with this? For example, spot-checking moderation decisions to make sure they&#39;re in line with site-wide policy? This could be particularly effective with keywords in determining which subs are routinely allowing rule-breaking content.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>I recognize that moderation at scale is very hard. And Reddit&#39;s decentralized community-based moderation generally seems to work well. But in specific situations (largely involving moderators who don&#39;t follow site-wide rules) it really falls down. I&#39;m curious how Reddit plans to deal with that and how Reddit will discourage echo chambers of mis- and disinformation.</p>
