<div class="md"><p>In ascending order of importance.</p>

<p>1, deacent slower so reversing the movement is easier.</p>

<p>2, breathing and bracing needs to improve. Watch Brian Alsruhe videos on breathing and bracing.</p>

<p>3  wait for the music to drop during Du Hast to lift.</p>

<div class="md"><p>Basically, yes. When you squat down your body kinda folds on itself and shifts around to accommodate. </p>

<p>Bracing is essentially taking a big deep breathe in, pushing out/tightening your stomach/core, and holding it until you&#39;re about half way through the ascension, at the earliest. What this does is help keep your core and abdomen tight and supported so you can  go up with engaged muscles. This action makes a big difference and is the reason people wear belts. Belts help keep a strong brace. Kinda like knee/elbow sleeves but for your core.</p>

<p>Try doing some pause squats where you go down ass to grass, take a few breathes, and then ascend. You&#39;ll notice it&#39;s more difficult to breathe and it&#39;s more difficult to ascend. Then try bracing and doing a normal rep and feel the difference. </p>

<p>Check out Alan Thrall for some great videos on how to improve your form. Keep working and good luck!</p>

<div class="md"><p>When you tried to go up your butt moves up but your back stays in place which signals to me that perhaps your core and lower back strength could use some work. It‚Äôs possible your legs are strong enough but your lower back can‚Äôt handle it quite yet.</p>

<div class="md"><p>You failed the lift but you nailed the fail.  You‚Äôve got many days of lifting ahead of you and you‚Äôre lifting close enough to failure (obviously) that you‚Äôll get bigger and stronger so you‚Äôre doing everything right.</p>

<div class="md"><p>As someone who failed literally hundreds of those.. Don&#39;t worry about it.. As long as you are not a professional competitor, bail early everytime. </p>

<p>I&#39;ve had this advice by a coach, &quot;if you are not competing, you have no business measuring your true 1rm&quot;, train until the 100kg is safe and easy for you.</p>

<p>That being said.. You probably failed this because you went down too quick. The momentum was to much to reverse.</p>
