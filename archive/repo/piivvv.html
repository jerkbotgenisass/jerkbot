<div class="md"><p>Thanks, I’ve personally taken the information from alphadestiny. He says it helps build a strong core and helps with bracing during compounds, he even talks about getting to a five plate weighted plank and that is pretty much bench mark for an amazing core but take from that what you will. I jus personally like his ideas so I implemented this!</p>

<div class="md"><p>I&#39;m not sure that would indicate a strong core, but it is impressive.  If you enjoy doing weighted planks, knock yourself out. It&#39;s probably helpful.</p>

<p>Your core connects your body and a good core allows you to transfer force through your body. A big deadlift and a big squat equals a strong core. A powerful punch or a great throw equals a strong core.</p>

<div class="md"><p>I mean say we can only bench 1rm at 135 pounds </p>

<ol>
<li><p>One person only work on isomeric bench exercises for 6 months.  </p></li>
<li><p>A other person is allowed to do bench presses  for progressive resistive exercises for 6 months. </p></li>
</ol>

<p>Then at the end of 6 months, who would have the highest isometric strength?  </p>

<p>You are correct that in the end doing both is important. But with doing progressive resistive exercises for ab work. You also do isomeric strengthening with every squat and deadlift. </p>

<p>If you only do isometric exercises with the the ab work and isometric again with the squat and deadlift (which is what the OP is doing), I don&#39;t think the gain will be as much.</p>

<p>Edit: I do agree that what OP is doing is improving his isometric strength. But there will be a limit to the weight increase without the muscle fiber hypertrophy. Eventually he can tear a muscle. Achieving muscle fiber hypertrophy with the ab muscles will help OP make further gains with isometric stengthening. And stay safer.</p>

<div class="md"><p>I think both is important when it comes to all muscles. I incorporate stretches positions, half reps, everything in my routine. But isometric strength does not equal stability, it’s a form of muscle adaptation the same way that skinny dudes can be seen deadlifting 8 plates</p>

<div class="md"><p>Hmm. This idea is a new one to me. </p>

<p>To my simplistic thinking, increasing abdominal and back sore muscles helps with liver stabilization. </p>

<p>Strengthening the abdominal muscles with the oblique and trans versus addiminis muscles in the front as well as the lumbar Para spinal muscles improve lumbar stability. </p>

<p>The planks he does with increased resistance will improve his isometric strength. That is good. But there is limited upside to how much strength he can develop unless he can achieve muscle fiber hypertrophy, which requires progressive resistive exercises. The same principe used to build muscle in the limb muscles with the bench presses, dead lift, squats, etc. increasing the muscle isotonic strength with 1Ram will has transferability/carry over effect to isometric strength. Just as if you start with a 1RM at 135 pounds your isometric strength is relative to that. By then when you work out with the strongman 5x5, and in 6 months progress to 1RM of 225 pounds, your isometric strength will be increased, even if you don&#39;t specifically work on isometric strengthening. </p>

<p>The idea of which muscles to strengthen is based on this book. The idea of progressive overload principle be isometric strengthening is not in the book. I follow that based on my weightlifting experience. </p>

And focus on using the abs. Not the iliopsoas. Unless you want to focus on the iliopsoas. You can add up to 60 pounds on the machine at the gym.</p>
