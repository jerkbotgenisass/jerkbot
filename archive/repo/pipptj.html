Donna Doll inexplicably ate 5-6 pounds of potatoes before her death in 1970.

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>NIU senior Donna Doll was last seen leaving her job at the school library on Oct. 2, 1970. The 21-year-old never returned to her rooming house on Lincoln Highway.
Her friends searched for her. Her parents and siblings in Brookfield seemed suspended in fear. After nine days her body was found in a cornfield a little more than a mile west of campus.
Pathologists reported finding &quot;mystery substances&quot; in Doll&#39;s partly decomposed body that weren&#39;t explained or identified. Dennis Leifheit, then a sergeant with the DeKalb Police Department, said that no fibers were found in her lungs or airways, as would be usual in a suffocation. Authorities at the time said Doll had eaten an inordinate amount of potatoes, five or six pounds before her death.</p>

<div class="md"><p>As a former bulimic, this was my first thought. My second was that when I was in actively engaging in bulimic behaviours - starchy foods were a go to, because they came up so easily. I have binged on thick cut steak fries. </p>

<p>And sadly, many sufferes do risk death (through various means) when binging/purging. I think there&#39;s a medical case study floating around out there of someone whose stomach ruptured from eating so much. Yes, it&#39;s in the realm of possibility thay she ate that many potatoes on her own.  It&#39;s an awful, awful disease...</p>

<div class="md"><p>I used to binge and restrict. I remember making batch after batch of instant potatoes once. I couldn&#39;t get enough. I probably ate close to a box. Starchy carby foods like that just gave me that dopamine hit I needed so badly. The highs were so high, and the lows... Well, I wouldn&#39;t wish it on anyone. It really is awful and I&#39;m happy it&#39;s behind me.</p>

<div class="md"><p>Weird how it appears different to different people. I had to convert to kilos to get a proper idea of the weight, and thought it wasn&#39;t too bad. Potatoes arent the lightest veggie out there, either - it sounds heavy, but the actual amount isn&#39;t that massive. I mean, it&#39;s a solid helping, but if you eat it over some time and give it a bit of time to settle, or if you&#39;re used to eating much and fast, it&#39;s not impossible. Other people have brought up bingeing and bulimia, too, which is something I can get on board with.</p>

<div class="md"><p>I&#39;m very skeptical of forensic pathology findings from decades ago. In 1970, DeKalb County used a used a County Coroner who was actually a funeral director--not a forensic pathologist. So all of the findings about time, manner of death (including the potatoes) might be suspect. If you have access to <a href="https://Newspapers.com">Newspapers.com</a>, there are some good tidbits about the case as it progressed early on.</p>

<div class="md"><p>&quot;Coroner&quot; is an elected position.  You don&#39;t even have to be a doctor to be a coroner.  Their job is to declare someone dead for legal purposes.  They may or may not be able to preform an autopsy, depending on their medical training.  So if the county used a coroner/funeral director to declare death, that&#39;s pretty normal.  If the coroner/funeral director did an autopsy then yeah, that&#39;s shady.</p>

<div class="md"><p>It was common in many places and I think they were doing what they thought was best. There weren&#39;t a lot of medical examiners around back then and the funeral director was sometimes the only guy in town who understood gross anatomy. They would hold a coroner&#39;s jury to document evidence and determine the cause of death, so multiple people were involved. But, sadly for many criminal cases, this old system didn&#39;t provide the best forensics knowledge.</p>

<div class="md"><p>Oh I don&#39;t mind. I love baked potatoes, and I used to drink very heavily so it was my go-to hangover food. I&#39;d eat 2-3 a day sometimes because they&#39;re cheap and easy to make. The problem was, my corner bodega always had green ones (higher in solanine) and sometimes I didn&#39;t cook them long enough (raw potato is higher in solanine too.) I also ate the skin because I read it had more vitamins/minerals (yes, you guessed it, higher in solanine.) I ate one after a week of lots of them and pretty much the moment it hit my stomach I was so sick. Vomiting, diarrhea, hallucinations, cold sweats, low-grade fever. 0/10 would not recommend.</p>

<div class="md"><p>Raw potatoes are a common food that people with Pica crave.  With pica, some people can eat so much non-food items, or not typically edible items that it can make them ill.  If the potatoes had been raw, and she did this often or in large amounts, it can cause cardiac problems.  Why did they think suffocation vs. natural causes?</p>

<div class="md"><p>I used to work at a facility for adults with autism and we had a resident with pica. I accidently left my homework sitting out one night. He ate it. How do you even try to explain to your professor that someone ate your homework?</p>

<p>That was honestly one of the better non-food item he got ahold of during the time I worked there. Kleenex, garbage bags, the plastic from briefs (diapers), the needles from an artificial tree, his own feces. He was a bit of a nightmare when it came to eating.</p>

<div class="md"><p>I worked with (for?) a man who did the same. His own diapers, his housemate&#39;s diapers (sometimes with period blood in them), anything. </p>

<p>I honestly don&#39;t know if he had any proper diagnosis, because he was born in the early 50&#39;s, and idk how much they knew back then, or cared enough to find out. He was non-verbal, and somehow, in the middle of all this, they slapped an autism sticker on him too. I have no idea why, it seemed like a weird fit to me. Possibly it was one of the not too many diagnoses they could actually use on him...</p>

<div class="md"><p>I may be wrong, but I think that people that suffer from Pica also tend to crave things with an “earthy” aroma, like dirt, clay, etc… I would think that potatoes would fit that bill, especially if they’re raw and unwashed. </p>

<p>Do we know if  this woman had a history of Pica related behavior? </p>

<div class="md"><p>Yup, can just start craving strange things one day.  It&#39;s more common in women.  It can happen due to nutrient deficiencies (usually iron deficiency).  It is really common in pregnancy.  It&#39;s so common in fact, that they sell food grade kaolin (mud/clay) at some specialty food stores for women craving this when they are pregnant.</p>

<div class="md"><p>Potatoes concentrate a glycoalkaloid poison called solanine in the eyes.  Eating six pounds of potatoes with eyes (or improperly grown potatoes, which can have an overall presence of solanine to combat pests) could take down a human.  Six pounds is a lot of potatoes and a lot of solanine.  I&#39;d have tested for it, but it&#39;s super possible that the ME didn&#39;t.  It&#39;s only something I&#39;d think to check for after finding a fuckin bag of tubers in someone, and I&#39;ve got 51 years of science to pull from that the guys in 1970 wouldn&#39;t have had, as well.</p>

<div class="md"><p>That&#39;s a fair point, and obviously I have NO idea what happened here, it&#39;s bonkers, but six pounds fast enough would probably trigger the seizures nice and early, and if she went totally comatose after that she wouldn&#39;t necessarily have the emetic reaction, keeping the potatoes in. I, too, would expect that a normal person would have to fight emesis and all sorts of potato-induced craziness, but there&#39;s nothing normal about this <em>at all</em>.

<div class="md"><p>Well, it&#39;s entirely possible that this is a red herring. Maybe she had pica or a binge eating disorder, and was murdered not long after eating by coincidence? Or maybe, as pointed out in this thread, the funeral director (not a pathologist) in the 70s just wasn&#39;t educated enough in this realm to know?   </p>

<p>If a person has pica or a binge eating disorder, there are certainly a lot of issues healthwise they could have that could lead to death.</p>
