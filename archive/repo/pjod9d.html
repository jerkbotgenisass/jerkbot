<div class="md"><p>I read:</p>

<p>The Guest LIst by Lucy Foley.</p>

<p>Just fine.  Locked room mystery.  I figured it out early out, but it was still fine.</p>

<p>Guess Who by Chris McGeorge</p>

<p>Started out great, but at some point got more unrealistic than normal, and I had to think about it to even remember what happened.  Eh.</p>

<p>Billy Summers by Stephen King</p>

<p>I am a fan boy.  I pre-ordered this without reading anything about it, because I don&#39;t care.  It will be great no matter what.  It was.  King creates characters I love getting to know, and this was no different.  </p>

<p>The Troop by Nick Cutter</p>

<p>Book-Horror doesn&#39;t usually get to me, but this had some parts that were HARD to read.  It was A+ material, but I liked it.  </p>

<p>Sandman Slim and Kill the Dead, by Richard Kadrey</p>

<p>A new Sandman Slim novel arrived on my doorstep halfway through the month, so I am now ignoring the massive stack of &quot;to read&quot; books to re-read the whole series, and I still love it a lot.</p>
