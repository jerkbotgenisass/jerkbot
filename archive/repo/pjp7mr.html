<div class="md"><p>From my own personal experience and what I&#39;ve heard from my own fetal specialist. Girls tend to survive <em>severe</em> genetic disorders more frequently than boys. My first pregnancy was with a little boy, during my 20 week ultrasound there were some obvious physical issues along with an amniocentesis led to a diagnosis of trisomy 18. I ended up losing him by the end of my 20th week </p>

<p>The fetal specialist I saw told me boys that have severe genetic disorders tend to not survive(unfortunately I do not remember the reason why) I believe it&#39;s due to lacking the extra X chromosome but don&#39;t quote me.</p>

When my niece and nephew were born and I helped take care of them a lot, my mom and sister would always tell to rest them on my hips if my arms got tired of holding them.

<div class="md"><p>Yep. When I closed for a fast food place I&#39;d usually be the one to go and pick up traffic cones, signs, etc. We had signs directing traffic with these crazy heavy bases. I tried showing my male coworkers how I picked up the sign (reach around the base of the pole, lift with your legs, cradle the heavy base to your hip, pole out behind you). They just couldn&#39;t do it. They could lift it, yeah, but they just couldn&#39;t hold it the way I could.</p>

<p>Most ended up just slinging it on their shoulder or dragging it on the floor. One guy hugged it to his chest until he got to the door. Got the job done ig, but man do I feel bad for them.</p>

<div class="md"><p>I couldn&#39;t carry our son as long as my wife. It blew my mind because she has no upper body strength whereas I go to the gym and am the designated carrier and mover of objects.</p>

<p>Then it clicked one day when I saw her holding him for awhile. He sits on her hip as she leans a bit. I tried it and he never sat on anything unless my arm was directly under his butt. She would always give me crap about me not wanting to hold him when really I just couldn&#39;t hold him as long.</p>

<div class="md"><p>I noticed this with my husband and i. He holds most of our babies weight in his hand or on his forearm. While i put his butt straddling my hip and grab his forward thigh or just tuck a hand under his knee which keeps my arm straight along his back to keep him from doing any spontaneous movements.</p>

<p>But let me tell you! I bought a TushBaby hip seat and we both LOVE IT!!! the best $60 i ever spent. I wear it all day just spin it to the back when I dont need to carry my baby. I can do everything without ever getting tired of holding him. He hated being in full carriers but loves his hip seat. And it can support up to like 50lbs. So I can still use it for my 4yo as well when he needs to be carried! </p>

<p>Any other new parents reading this, get you a hip seat. Thank me later.</p>

<div class="md"><p>That depends on country and culture i think</p>

<p>Here we hug when we greet and kissin on the cheek is pretty much normal for males and females and its not considered sexual when a man kisses a woman on the cheek when he hugs her as a greeting</p>

<p>Sometimes relativea who you&#39;ve not seen in a long time even force you into a hug and cheek kisses (which can be annoying tbh)</p>

<div class="md"><p>A couple of people have interpreted this as groping each other, but I feel like what I really notice in men is that they aren’t as comfortable with intimacy. Sitting right up next to each other thigh to thigh on the couch under a blanket to watch a movie, resting a head on the other persons shoulder, gently moving an eye lash off of someone’s face, holding hands are all practises I’ve experienced within my platonic relationships with women that I’ve never generally seen men be comfortable with.</p>

<p>Like yeah smacking each other’s butts is whatever, but I think it’s kind/gentle physical touch that is lacking.</p>

<div class="md"><p>Yep, 100% this. It was at least 10 years ago but to this day my best friend still brings up the time she was going through a really depressed patch. She&#39;d spend every weekend staying over at my place, and just lie on the sofa next to me, crying quietly or or completely zoned out. I&#39;d put a Monroe or Hepburn boxset on for her, surround her with snacks and sit and stroke her hair for hours. I knew she didn&#39;t want to talk, she just wanted to not be alone and who doesn&#39;t like having their hair or head stroked?
Anyway, she still tells me how much that meant to her, having that comfort, and I know there are some men who would do something similar for their friends but the majority would feel uncomfortable and it&#39;s a shame really.</p>

<div class="md"><p>When I was in high-school I had a lot of female friends and friend groups that were fairly relaxed and chill with casual touch. Cuddling and napping together and such. Was really nice.</p>

<p>I moved for university and there I found it impossible to form a similar friend group. The men were much more frat-like and the women were on guard and treated any attempt to be friendly as hitting on them or attempting to get laid. I had multiple &quot;friends&quot; just up and ghost me one day because they decided they either weren&#39;t interested in me or they got into a different relationship.</p>

<div class="md"><p>It&#39;s a technique called hooking that fighter pilots use. They tense up their muscles and grunt and push. Almost like trying to force out a super constipated shit. It forces blood to the brain.</p>

<div class="md"><p>Work with children.</p>

<p>As someone who works in early childhood education I&#39;ve had the cops called on me three times when I took my kiddos to the park. Thankfully I know the beat cop quite well so it has never caused me any real issues, but the fact that people see &quot;Adult man...interacting with children???&quot; and assume I&#39;m a violent predator honestly hurts a lot. </p>

<p>My team is all big, burly, heavily tattooed men, but we are all insanely qualified to do our jobs, but that all means nothing to some random Karen who sees scary-looking me give piggyback rides or do a girl&#39;s braids. I had a bad childhood and just want to care of the little ones, kindly fuck off.</p>

<p>Edit: I really didn&#39;t expect this post to get the response it did, so I feel like I should add some more information:</p>

<p>I&#39;d say about 95% of the families I work with are thrilled to have a man working with their kids, or just don&#39;t really care. So many children grow up without positive male role models in their life and are incredibly grateful for the work we do. Men, don&#39;t be discouraged thinking you can&#39;t work with kids, most people are going to be quite supportive. Boys need men to show them how to be men, step up and help our little guys! With the right certifications and degrees it can also be a pretty decent paying job with insane job security. </p>

<p>To the Europeans saying &quot;Found the American&quot;, this happened in a European country, stop acting like gender role related issues are an exclusively American problem, it only makes it harder to address these issues. </p>

<p>What do the kids think of us? By and large we are their favorite teachers, and since they don&#39;t have a concept of why men like us are seen as intimidating, they just see us with a more objective view. They really like my tattoos, and sometimes draw on themselves or put on fake tattoos to look like us. One of my girls was furious with me one day and drew all over arms and face to look like my tattoos and beard and went around like &quot;Hurr durr, I&#39;m CaucasianDelegation, get off the table and get in line!&quot; Never have I been so utterly wrecked, I was nearly in tears laughing!</p>

<div class="md"><p>Yeah, but as a dad I don&#39;t have an ID card.</p>

<p>So, when my kids were little, taking them in public without their mother either brought disapproving and accusatory looks or the ol&#39; &quot;<em>Are you babysitting?</em>&quot; bullshit.</p>

<p>No, you fuckwit mongrel, I&#39;m parenting.  Just like their mother does.  I&#39;m not less qualified or justified in spending time with my kids just because I have a cock.</p>

<p>And when I got the &quot;babysitting&quot; line, I <em>always</em> told the stranger (<em>because it was always some stranger making that remark</em>) that their mother had died and i was a single parent.</p>

<p>It always stopped them in their tracks as they try to recover from feeling like the asshole they were.</p>

<p>She&#39;s not dead.  Alive and well.  I just liked doing that to people because they fucking deserve feeling like that.</p>

<div class="md"><p>Wow just wow. My ex bf is black/mixed but his little half siblings are much more white-passing. Some lady started harassing them in public once because she thought he kidnapped them or something. She even tried to grab one of the kids. The kids asserting to her that he was their brother got her to back off without cops getting called, but my ex was livid and the kids were pretty distressed over it.

So people are less likely to say anything because I am female, and they probably think I’m also a bit special because of the blindness and the fact that I’m a 35-year-old woman hanging out on the swing regularly.

<div class="md"><p>That is a common thing that sighted people say. It has something to do with the way the visual cortex processes motion I think. And I’m a freak. I can swing, I can spin, I rock back-and-forth a lot. So I need a lot more physical stimulation than most sighted people. But the getting sick with motion with your eyes closed is super common.</p>

<div class="md"><p>It is absolutely not a stupid question. I’m happy to answer it. So most smart phones nowadays have what is called a screen reader and built. This is a program that converts your text on your screen into speech that I can hear. Also most phones have a dictate function, for you guys I think it’s a little microphone icon beside your spacebar if you are using an iPhone anyway.  So I press that button and then speak to the phone and tell it what I want to write. I can also type on the phone. And I also have a way to make it so that I can use a virtual braille keyboard on the phone. If for whatever reason I can’t or shouldn’t dictate, I will usually use the braille keyboard. And with that braille keyboard, I am as fast at typing out a text as any sighted person is.</p>

<p>Computers also have screen readers, though their quality for the in built ones is a bit questionable. Mac has voiceover, which is decent enough. But windows has narrator, and even with the improvements that have been made over the years, it is still a pretty much non-functional pile of crap for those of us who can’t see anything. So we use programs like Jaws or NVDA on Windows machines. I learned to use a computer and touch type when I was seven years old, so I can also touch type faster than most sighted people. Not trying to brag. It just is what it is.</p>

<p>Iunderstand most of what is going on in text posts. But pictures don’t usually get described much on here. Facebook and Instagram now have options to write captions on your pictures. And descriptions as well. But I don’t think Reddit has made that feature yet, or if they have, people aren’t using it. Which is understandable, considering it means an extra step for you guys just for a few peoples enjoyment. That said, there are a lot of subs that are just a ton of pictures. I’ve had to unsubscribe from a number of them, because those are a bit frustrating for me. I love cooking related subs though, because usually people will post text versions of recipes in comment sections. So I love reading stuff like that. And any of the text base posts are great.</p>

<p>Sorry for the novel here. I got really detailed. Hope this helps.</p>

<div class="md"><p>Once, I [30M] was on break at my last job which was near a lake, lots of families and people walking, hanging out etc. I was sitting in the grass on my phone relaxing, minding my own business when this adorable little girl walks up to me (she&#39;s maybe like 6?) and says &quot;um, would you like to run with us?&quot; gesturing to her friends nearby.</p>

<p>I said &quot;no thanks! I&#39;m tired from working but I&#39;ll watch you!&quot; but she wouldn&#39;t take no for an answer and they all started running around me. I was stuck in this sticky situation, it melted my heart that she wanted to be my friend but obviously a grown man playing with strange kids in a park doesn&#39;t really fly, but I couldn&#39;t explain that to her.</p>

<p>I sat there kind of awkwardly not knowing what to do, when her mom finally walked up. Luckily her mom was really cool and jokingly asked if they were bothering me. I left shortly after and said goodbye. Just glad her dad didn&#39;t run over and throw me into the lake for harassing his kid lol</p>

<div class="md"><p>I walked out of a grocery one day and a little girl ran up, wrapped her arms around my legs and hollered Daddy! loudly. Mom was absolutely horrified and completely embarrassed as the little girl realized I was NOT who she was expecting 🤣 So apologetic and I just laughed and chatted with the girl a moment, apparently Dad wasn’t far behind me and she was shy over having made the mistake. Completely innocent and cute but that mother looked so scared and mortified like I was going to be angry or something that I can’t forget it. Kids are kids, they make noise, they play, they ask questions and make mistakes. Can’t get bent out of shape over stuff like that 🤷🏼‍♂️</p>

<div class="md"><p>Reminds me of this time when I went to have lunch with one of my son&#39;s at school. He was in 3rd or 4th grade and they had recess right after lunch so he asked if I wanted to stay for recess (because who doesn&#39;t love recess). The teacher over heard him and told me that would be okay with her so I hung around.</p>

<p>They ran out to the playground and he and his cohorts surrounded me expecting something fun but I had no idea what they did for fun so we were all kinda staring at each other when my son&#39;s says &quot; you can help us play chase the girls&quot;. They were very enthusiastic about it too like I was some kind of secret weapon or something.</p>

<p>I quickly declined the offer thinking about the problems that it could possibly cause the teachers, school, myself, whoever.</p>

I remember convincing my mom to drive me across the city to visit the exotic petstore that he told us about. Rob was an awesome guy. One day he told us that we couldn&#39;t really be friends or whatever anymore, that we needed to stop coming up during lunch, because it was looking weird to the teachers. He didn&#39;t say it exactly, but we got the gist. Super sad because we LOVED bugging him. Rob, if you&#39;re out there reading this, Shaina is about to have identical twin girls! Next week!!!</p>
