<div class="md"><p>If you haven&#39;t watched, please watch <a href="https://youtu.be/wYREQkVtvEc">dead lift setup</a> (this will also address your knee positioning) . I would also suggest slowing down so that you can focus on your form on each rep.</p>

<div class="md"><p>Start with the bar on the ground.  </p>

<p>Then lift, then back to the ground and pause to reset.</p>

<p>Don’t ‘bounce and go’ like this, because it makes it hard to keep your form and (at least for me) the bouncing is really jarring.</p>

<div class="md"><p>The best thing I could do to improve my form was to not take the warm up sets lightly. For me they are not just to warm up my budy, but also to warm up my mind also.</p>

<p>I try do all reps in all warm up sets the same way as I would do my work set, constantly thinking on my form. Do not run through them, do not feel like they are a waste of time. </p>

<p>About Your form: slow down, no tuch and gos. You can not keep a good form like that. When You finished a rep, check Your starting position and adjust if necessary, even if it takes a couple of seconds. It is not a speed race.</p>

<div class="md"><p>No, I think the problem is people come to this sub and think it is a sub for people just entering their fitness journey, not a sub about a specific program called “starting strength.” </p>

<p>I also agree that she’s here for attention, but that’s a good thing! She’s asking for help and definitely seems to be new to the deadlift. Posting a video of herself in a sub with thousands of expert lifters takes guts and vulnerability!  We should be stoked that she’s here!</p>

imagine pinching a coin between butt, 
pull the weight with “packed Lats”, 
stick your chest out and drive your hips through to get the dead weight up slowly.</p>

<div class="md"><p>This is terrible advice. Do not ever suggest adding weight when someone hasn’t mastered the basic mechanics of the lift.</p>

<p>I can easily pull 3 working sets of 305. I start my warmup with 95lbs on the ground for 10. Similarly to literally every other lift... If you cannot perform a proper rep with just the bar/super light weight how do u think you can properly perform it with more weight?</p>

<div class="md"><p>She’s like 99% of the way there. The form was just fine, really just the touch and go and walking out with the weight that wasn’t great. She’s not doing anything that would cause her harm with more weight. If you can walk out that effortlessly with the weight you’re deadlifting, you need a lot more weight. But again in this situation it was probably just a light weight to show us form not her heavy working sets.</p>

<div class="md"><p>99%?! Are you crazy? 
She needs to tighten her lats. 
Lock out her back. 
Not cave her knees. 
Learn to use valsalva to fortify her midsection (more importantly spine) 
find an proper starting position. 
The bar is moving like 6 inches forward on her descent and she’s bouncing it off the floor.<br/>
Look at how rounded her upper back is!</p>

<div class="md"><p>I’m not trolling. I gave you 6-7 reasons why she’s not “99% of the way there.” </p>

<p>All you can offer is “eh…looks good to me. Add more weight and you’re good.” And two obvious errors. </p>

<p>She is literally starting her lift in the exact opposite position from what is considered proper technique. </p>

<p>Maybe entertain the idea that you have something to learn instead of deflecting.</p>

<div class="md"><p>And most of your reasons are bs. Rounded back? Where? Weight too far forward? It’s grinding up her knees. Her knees don’t cave. There is no way you can tell if she’s using the valsalva trick or not from this video. The only things I can see wrong are the starting position, and tightening up the form which a lot of times comes naturally when adding weight. I do have much to learn, but not here. You’re a beginner by your numbers so don’t act like your the expert either.</p>

<div class="md"><p>Cool story. Hey everybody this guy says he does working sets at 305!  Easily! </p>

<p>Meanwhile, this lifter could stand to add some weight to the bar instead of doing more reps. Lighter weight allows more fucking around with form where a heavier weight does not. Review page 128 of the Blue Book which describes one example where a heavier weight provides educational feedback to the lifter and can clean up the movement</p>

<p>Here’s a basic warmup. Reference the 2x5 at the beginning. That’s um…how to effectively set up. </p>

<p>Yes, I’ve read the book, you’re application of it is seriously flawed. There is still a lot of groundwork to be done, namely just some major changes to protect this persons knees, lower, and upper back. Also, page 1 is linear bar path. Cmon.</p>

<div class="md"><p>I’d say increase the weight to where you can only do like 5 reps and look at your form then. It’s easy to do good form with light weight but press your limits and you’ll then find when your form starts to slip. It looks fine at this weight though but this was a light weight for you.</p>
