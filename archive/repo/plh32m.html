<div class="md"><p>Could have also been a failed rep. Not every attempt is going to end with the lifter stapled under the bar. Very easily could have lost tension in his back/a bad breath and bailed after a quarter rep instead of collapsing all the way just to make someone else happy. </p>

<p>Source: I hate dropping bars just to fail a rep correctly for some dickhead online when I know the weight isn’t going up regardless</p>

<div class="md"><p>I would say it&#39;s better to do atg if you can or work up to it if you cannot. It&#39;s good to be able to handle the full range of motion and to build strength in the atg position, and more ROM equals more hypertrophy benefit.</p>

<div class="md"><p>I heard the last bit of ROM of a2g squats doesn&#39;t really do much in terms of hypertrophic benefit. I notice when I do it myself, the very bottom doesn&#39;t seem to be as difficult as it does when moving from closer to standard squat depth (just below parallel). So i stopped squatting so deep, and just go slightly below parallel. But then, I&#39;m also one of those people who feels a 90 minute weightlifting workout is too long. Call me lazy, but I try to be more time/work efficient.</p>

<div class="md"><p>You probably can use more weight if you do parallel squats compared to atg squats. Your muscles need to work more to move the bar through a full range of motion, that means more muscle stress = hypertrophy.</p>

<div class="md"><p>Well what I mean, is in my experience, it&#39;s less effort at the bottom of atg squats compared with the rest of the ROM. I&#39;m sure there&#39;s benefit to doing it, but I&#39;m no body builder, and don&#39;t want to be one, so getting the absolute most out of my every workout isn&#39;t necessary.</p>

<div class="md"><p>Sure, bodybuilding is not my goal either. The atg position is also good because you&#39;re preparing your body to handle load in the entirety of the range of your joints, as well as building/and or preserving your mobility. </p>

<p>By any means if it hurts you to do it or simply don&#39;t want to, you don&#39;t have to do it completely at once.</p>

<div class="md"><p>Ass to grass. Meaning, you go super low on the squat. But I agree with <a href="/r/evilopievcxgbs">/r/evilopievcxgbs</a> on this one. Even if it&#39;s not ass to grass, most people see a completed squat as parallel, if not below parallel. This guy maybe only went a quarter of the way down, maybe not even that.

<div class="md"><p>Sure but with the bad position he can only help a few percent of the load. You need two strong guys at each side with knowledge of the proper technique to spot such a heavy squat, and as always the squatter has to contribute a lot of the force.</p>

<p>That&#39;s exactly right. When I ask for a spot, it&#39;s primarily for convenience: help me get it back on the rack so I don&#39;t have to dump it. And I&#39;m still doing the majority of the work, I&#39;m not expecting anyone to row 200+ lbs off of me unassisted.</p>

<p>And outside of a competition setting, it&#39;s unfair to ask someone else to be responsible for your safety -- if there&#39;s a safety concern, I should be in a power rack. No need for the spotter to have their hands hovering over the bar anticipating a drop. If I fail a rep, it&#39;ll slowly sink to my chest, and it&#39;s not such a huge weight that it&#39;s a danger for it to rest on me. If it were, or if there was a possibility of it slipping out of my hands, I should be in a rack with safeties.</p>

<div class="md"><p>You can either make a bar (metal) snap or bend. Harden steel is stronger but can snap like that. Softer steel would bend, instead of snapping, but would be unusable under less weight. So the manufacturer decided to use harden steel, so under most uses it’ll keep its shape. While a better bar would be using softer steel but higher quality/cost, so it wouldn’t snap but won’t bend under heavy load either. A harden steel example you see is in mechanic tools, they’ll snap clean off, instead of bending.</p>

<div class="md"><p>You can make them do both, it&#39;s just more work. When you make knives/swords you typically want it to go through a heat treat process to make it both hard and flexible. On a mass production scale it&#39;s not super useful to do this, especially when you&#39;re talking about rebar. Rebar you&#39;re really after tensile strength and stiffness, not hardness. If you&#39;re got rebar snapping, that probably means whatever process that was used to make it either included way too much carbon and you&#39;ve essentially made cast iron, or was cooled far too quickly, or a mixture of both I suppose. I guess it could also be impurities in the steel if their refining is shit.</p>

<div class="md"><p>You’re much stronger 90-upright than you are below 90. And from an athletic training perspective, there’s like 0 reason to train below 90, because how often do you get below 90 and then have to get out of it with force? And when it comes to getting to 90, that should be measured by the angle formed at the knee, not the ground, so it probably won’t look like you’re parallel to the ground.</p>

<p>If you do want to train below 90, you use lighter weights and work in that deep range of motion without even getting fully upright, because there’s no real benefit to doing so.</p>

<p>Also, and this is my favorite part, your knees should get in front of your toes and you should be pushing through the ball of your foot not your heel.</p>

<div class="md"><p>Idk I&#39;ve done both and I agree with him. I think once you get well below parallel you end up relying on your joints to hold you and not your muscle. That&#39;s why so many people in Easter countries sit in that ATG squat position for long periods of time. Requires no muscle activation. I see what you&#39;re saying though, maybe if you consciously continue to use your muscles throughout the bottom.... Idk</p>

<div class="md"><p>Sorry but you’re wrong brother. At the bottom of the squat you can sit and not have much stress put on your quads. Think of a Slav squat, you can hold that for such a long time since your muscles aren’t being stressed. </p>

<p>In the original comment, I’d suggest going to about 80% depth, or when your thighs are parallel to the ground. If you can comfortably go deeper then great, but you shouldn’t go so far down that you relax the muscles.</p>

<div class="md"><p>Yeah what i meant is when you fully squat on your heels you actually dont use your muscles anymore. I do believe that the re engagement on the way up can put overstress on knee meniscus and things like that so i try and avoid doing a full slav squat with alot of weight. It doesnt hurt or anything but it feels wrong compared to 80% down and then back up</p>

<div class="md"><p>Or a bailed squat they knew they weren&#39;t gonna be able to complete. When you actually get into lifting you&#39;ll realize this happens. Sometimes your programming or goal says to do a certain weight but sometimes you put that weight on the bar and start the rep and just know it isn&#39;t gonna happen. Pointless to completely fail a rep you know you won&#39;t finish. </p>

<p>Takes a whole lot less ego to acknowledge that you aren&#39;t gonna be able to do it and just reset. </p>

<p>Also could have felt the bar moving weird and decided to bail for that reason. </p>

<p>Wrong. Deep squats produce more muscle growth and functional strength than half squats. Half squats are good for increasing the amount of weight you can half squat, but deep squats are better for pretty much everything else.</p>

<p>Doesn’t really seem like you have any room to call someone an idiot when you’re dumb enough the believe that not doing a full range of motion could somehow cause “more muscle activation.” Use your head, dude.</p>

<div class="md"><p>You&#39;re right that you should lift with a view to avoiding injury, and there&#39;s no shame in that...</p>

<p>&#x200B;</p>

<p>Based on your other comments it appears you have a decent amount of lifting knowledge.</p>

<p>I would bet money on this being an ego-lift single. Look at the spotter. He reverses direction without any communication from the lifter. Implies this is standard depth for this guy lifting. Also that grunt is not</p>

<p><em>&quot;oh today&#39;s not my day guess I&#39;m bailing&quot;</em></p>

<p>, it&#39;s</p>

<p><strong>&quot;i just fkn nailed this 7 plate excuse of a squat boiiiii&quot;</strong></p>

<p>Again this <em>could</em> be just an off day for this guy. However, I would strongly argue that he&#39;s actually just sacrificing form to increase load. There <em>is</em> shame in doing that and parading it around, as it will encourage newer lifters to do the same which increases the likelihood of injury</p>

<div class="md"><p>As much as I appreciate the sarcasm, I listed my reasoning and stated that I could still be wrong. I see you&#39;re active on the Powerlifting subreddit, and appear reasonably knowledgeable</p>

<p>In my experience there are generally 2 reasons to film a lift at the gym:</p>

<ul>
<li>Form check, either for yourself or from a coach</li>
<li>Flex for the gram</li>
</ul>

<p>Based on the filming angle, the depth being a million miles from acceptable in any respectable fedetation, and the fact that the spotters completely blocking the view of this guys hips, which do you think is more likely?</p>

<p>Solid points. Would recommend Yoke over half-squats if you want to acclimatise to heavy weights but you&#39;re right, can&#39;t assume his goals</p>

<p>I enjoy watching and training with people stronger than me, so this isn&#39;t some kind of insecurity/superiority complex coming out. It&#39;s still impressive to unrack/half-squat 300kg. My argument is that this freak accident occurred <strong>precisely because he was performing that exercise in a way that allowed him to load more weight that the equipment is capable of, which increases the chance of injury for the lifter and other gym members</strong></p>

<div class="md"><p>Lol, 1/2 repping with weight you can&#39;t handle <em>is</em> the &quot;stupid macho &#39;gotta impress people&#39; crap&quot; that gets people hurt. This guys obviously pretty strong, but 90% of the time it&#39;s so much better to have good form, full range of motion, and light weight than try to rush to where you&#39;re failing reps.</p>

<div class="md"><p>I’ve lifted for 20 years. I pull over 500 lbs consistently. I coached athletes for years. Never, not once have I ever practiced, coached or observed a decent lifter doing 3/4 or 1/2 rep deadlifts to “test” it. </p>

<p>If you know what you are doing, you have a really good idea of what an RPE10 lift is going to be. It’s not a shot in the dark that you have to “test”. You’ve probably already done 98% of that weight before. If you try it and can’t lift it for whatever reason, you set it down.</p>

<p>You might be thinking of block or rack pulls, which are entirely different things.</p>

<div class="md"><p>See more judgement. Why? Do you know the guys ability? Maybe he lifts that much regularly but today wasn&#39;t feeling it. If I don&#39;t get enough sleep, haven&#39;t eaten enough, whatever else? How much I can pick up goes down. I have absolutely had to put down weight that I thought I could lift and so has <em>every other person I have ever trained with</em>.</p>

<p>Maybe he was being stupid. I don&#39;t know. I just really hate the shittalking of people who are in the gym trying to be healthy, usually from people who have spent about 8 minutes of their life there one January 1st. What&#39;s wrong with giving him the benefit of the doubt?</p>

<div class="md"><p>I&#39;m with <a href="/r/Johnfromwork">/r/Johnfromwork</a> on this</p>

<p>As someone who regularly goes to the gym (up until pandemic... home gym Yay), you quickly identify the folks who rather do &quot;half range 1RM max&quot; than a full range 1RM max rep. They do make it a visual to show how many plates are loaded but are not performing a squat with the crotch below the knees or ass to grass.</p>

<p>They do have no business with this amount of weights because I think mainly it&#39;s dangerous, and the spotter just plain sucks at spotting and leaves the lifter in danger.</p>

<p><em>EDIT</em> sorry guys and to the person in the video/gif, I was quick to judge as many valid reasons to justify doing a rep without full RoM such as health, new 1RM attempt, just having a bad day, etc. I said this based on what I see at my gym, and it&#39;s mostly young dudes who would benefit from beginners workout programs like SS or SL.</p>

<div class="md"><p>Except it&#39;s not dangerous if they can get the weight down as much as they want and back up. If you disagree with that kind of lifting then don&#39;t do it, leave others to do what they want. You and everyone with the same view are missing my point which is that <em>you have no context for these peoples lives or goals</em> and there is no reason to be a dick about it.</p>

<p>I could post a video of my workout from yesterday and you&#39;d all rip right into it about &quot;poor form&quot; and &quot;not a full rep&quot; for about half of what I did. 100% guaranteed. Three months ago a bunch of doctors very rudely took to me with scalpels, chopped me up, then put me back together again. Didn&#39;t die though, so that was a plus... but my range of motion is still a work in progress. A rapidly improving one thanks to working out and doing my physical therapy, but to a casual observer I&#39;m &quot;not doing it right&quot;.</p>

<p>I in fact have a series of injuries and issues from my past which change how I need to work out. And I&#39;ve had people &quot;just try and help&quot; by telling me I&#39;m doing it wrong... no, I&#39;m not. You just don&#39;t know what you&#39;re talking about.</p>

<p>Maybe that guy is just showing off. Maybe there&#39;s a perfectly reasonable explanation for what he&#39;s doing. I don&#39;t know. I do know that I don&#39;t need to be a dick to a stranger online about something I have no context for.</p>

<div class="md"><p>I&#39;ll give you that regarding the health context, whether the person is recovering or whatnot, you are right on that and that&#39;s my bad for assuming this person isn&#39;t in that scenario.</p>

<p>That being said, I see this too many times and I refuse to believe everyone has a medical reasons, especially when those doing this are barely 20yr olds and are better off focusing on SS&#39; guidelines than doing half reps. If it&#39;s their choice that&#39;s fine sure it&#39;s their body, but be safe with the weights. use a power rack or spotter who knows how to spot</p>

<div class="md"><p>The difference between squatting 550lbs and 500lbs is precisely the same as squatting with a 50lb backpack verses bodyweight squats, or curling a 50pb dumbbell vs just your arm. With big numbers it seems trivial, but it is extremely significant. If you had a young teenager or even child lifting you and the bar up at the lowest point or whatever your struggle spot is, and they add a measly 30lbs of upward pressure, suddenly you’ve got it and can rack the weight and breathe. Spotting is all about paying attention and assisting with the proper form, you don’t have to be especially strong or in a matching weight class even if the person you’re spotting is lifting very heavy</p>

<p>I&#39;ve never seen or heard of that happening. If you can&#39;t successfully lift the weight you collapse downwards until the rack catches the weight. The only alternative for what you are proposing is to do squats on the smith machine, but I don&#39;t know of anyone who prefers to do heavy squats on the smith machine.</p>

<div class="md"><p>Someone could have been gouged, scarred, or had their nape bored. Just like ropes, cables, chains, and straps that are used for towing/lifting, bars need to be retired and melted down. Can&#39;t be putting 500lbs on a bar year after year, dropping it from height, and accruing everyday fatigue and not expect something like this.</p>

<p>They don&#39;t even stamp the year of manufacture on bars, fuck all will ever change.</p>

<div class="md"><p>Quality stock steel bars do not ever, ever break, even with 3000+lbs loaded on each side. Look up on YouTube hydraulic press barbell loading. And you’ll see what I mean. This is a result of a cheap iron Chinese rusted bar being used in a very asinine way. Pretty much a worst case scenario of worst case scenario‘s.</p>

<p>But Yes. People have died from relying on cheap Chinese tools and materials for heavy work.</p>
