What is the purpose of this subreddit?
<br/><strong>Posted by <a id="userlink" href="https://www.reddit.com/user/hdhsjsskisudisisufue/">hdhsjsskisudisisufue</a>. </strong><em>Posted at 19:14 UTC on September 10, 2021. 35 Points. </em><em>(self.<a id="selfLink" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/StartingStrength/">StartingStrength</a>)</em><em> (<a id="postpermalink" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/StartingStrength/comments/plrmd2/what_is_the_purpose_of_this_subreddit/">Permalink</a>)</em>

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Lately this sub has had an extremely large influx of posts by people who are entirely unaware of what Starting Strength is, including users commenting on posts and offering (often, extremely poor/wrong) advice. It begs the question--what exactly is the purpose of this subreddit? Is it to be a general beginning strength subreddit that is filled with chronically weak people and wrong/bad advice, constant posts by people too lazy to read two pages from a book, and other garbage like all the other general fitness subreddits on this site?</p>

<p>It would be nice if we held the subreddit to a higher standard and actively encouraged thoughtful and informed discussion.</p>

<p>So, maybe as a first step in that direction--what do you think this subreddit should be? What is its purpose? How can we encourage higher post quality?</p>

<div class="md"><p>I agree with the fact that people seem to post here without knowing what SS is. Things like, &quot;I&#39;ve just started lifting how does my form look?&quot; and the guy is doing front squats. There is no place for front squats in SS when you are just starting. That kind of thing.</p>

<p>What I like about this forum is that we get faster feedback than in the SS official site.</p>

<div class="md"><p>I&#39;m not sure if it was your point, but I think front squats absolutely are discussion worthy here in the right context (and they&#39;re featured in both SS and PP.).</p>

<p>The poster in question almost certainly had no idea what they were doing and were being lazy--in which case I agree, that post should be removed.</p>

<div class="md"><p>Yes that&#39;s what I meant.</p>

<p>I also noticed that those people submit their form checks to multiple subredits at the same time. They assume that this is just another gym subredit.</p>

<div class="md"><p>Hi, I remember you. You&#39;re one of the few folks posting vids of heavy lifts (well, heavy to me) and I admire and respect your take on things. I&#39;m 100% on board with the direction you want to take this sub, and I think you have some fantastic ideas. Less clutter, less 10 second clips of people posting their first sumo deadlift, and less treating this place as form check central IF it&#39;s not directly related to Starting Strength or the core movements.     </p>

<p>I will happily give my best advice as a novice lifter. I preface what I post here with &quot;Not an SSC&quot; so that people don&#39;t get the wrong idea. I&#39;m no authority figure, I&#39;m learning as I go along. But the Blue Book is foundational - and this is important to me.     </p>

<p>I do think that this idea you have for the direction of this sub will ultimately help the community. As much as I like to weigh in on videos of folks looking for help just starting out, and want to continue doing that, I have to scroll past lots of filler which I believe comes from people just finding this sub with little to no basis of what it stands for.    </p>

<p>I&#39;d love to see discussion on the lifts, nutrition, programming, and people&#39;s experiences. I&#39;d love to NOT see tiktok-length videos of semi-related content with little substance and there are loads of places for people to see that.</p>

<div class="md"><p>Just make the sub private. You get rid of the lost redditors, incorrect information, up to date guidelines on strength and hypertrophy, and trolls.</p>

<p>It can be a great experiment: find out how well starting strength competes with other programs of a similar nature. </p>

<p>Good luck!</p>

<div class="md"><p>The point is to have a SS/PPST forum to discuss both without the scrutiny/dogma/fanaticism of the Starting Strength forum. I used to frequent it until there started being blatantly dogmatic/misogynistic/racist stuff just allowed to be spewed.  </p>

<p>&#x200B;</p>

<p>i.e. people telling people to eat through every sticking point, telling athletes in the season to do texas method instead of HLM, misogyny, racism, calling anything that isn’t what rip said “pussification” etc. that&#39;s pervasive over on that forum.</p>

<p>&#x200B;</p>

<p>The issues you bring up are primarily unavoidable in the case of bad advice. Anyone can post. So unless they introduce flair with verified totals/coaching credentials/etc that won&#39;t change. Additionally, the other solution would be for mods to simply takedown stuff more often. But again, that&#39;s an issue to take up with the mods.</p>

<div class="md"><p>To start answering how we can improve post quality, I think the subreddit does not make it sufficiently clear and explicit what the subreddit is about. Potential ways to improve the situation:</p>

<ul>
<li>Provide an explicit warning to users on the submission page that this is not a general strength subreddit and that they should be familiar with Starting Strength prior to posting.</li>
<li>Sticky a post at the top of the subreddit to the effect of &quot;READ BEFORE POSTING: THIS SUBREDDIT IS ABOUT THE STARTING STRENGTH METHOD&quot;.</li>
<li>A bot that requires users to reply to it an acknowledge that this is the Starting Strength subreddit before a post is acutaly posted.</li>
<li>Actually active mods that remove dangerous and wrong advice. Potentially remove content that is clearly posted by people who have no idea what they&#39;re doing and don&#39;t know what SS is. To be clear, this should be done extremely conservatively.</li>

<div class="md"><p>I’d definitely like more meta advice about the advice given here. I’ve lifted for almost a decade now, and have been lucky enough to have had a bunch of really good coaches. I only recently started posting here after discovering it by accident after seeing some truly scary stuff in the other weightlifting subreddits.</p>

<p>I like to think that I have a good eye for form, but I could be in the Dunning-Kruger valley. I think there needs to be a lot more positive and negative reinforcement on both the lifts and the advice to broaden the sources of good advice and raise the level of that advice.</p>

<div class="md"><p>Honestly though ... why don&#39;t you just go to the Starting Strength forums if that&#39;s what you&#39;re after?</p>

<p>I like this sub because discussion actually acknowledges that Rip&#39;s word isn&#39;t dogma for all things lifting, and even if people post some dumb shit here, that in and of itself presents a good opportunity to <em>introduce</em> people to Starting Strength.</p>

<div class="md"><p>I didn&#39;t say that SS/PP should be dogma. I believe it&#39;s important that users read SS/PP to give a common foundation and language by which to discuss things as well as avoid stupid questions and discussions. Disagreement and critique of SS/PP would be extremely welcome and encouraged in my book.</p>

<p>You cannot meaningfully disagree with something you do not understand.</p>

<p>The SS forums aren&#39;t ideal because Rip and/or other mods control everything and it&#39;s basically turned into a conservative/libertarian/doomer  political circlejerk.</p>

<div class="md"><p>I didn&#39;t say that you said that SS/PP should be dogma. I just mean that it&#39;s nice to have a place for slightly more nuanced discussion that also serves as an entrypoint to SS.</p>

<p>Like sure there are a lot of shitty posts but if that results in just one guy or gal trying out SS methods and sticking with it, it&#39;s worth the hassle to me.</p>

<p>And yes you are totally right about the SS forums. I used to go there a lot, used to consume a lot of other SS content, but it&#39;s all so mired in political nonsense and shitty medical takes these days I just can&#39;t.</p>

<div class="md"><p>I think part of the problem is the Reddit algorithm. Not long after I dropped in here, I started getting feeds for <a href="/r/bodybuilding">r/bodybuilding</a>, <a href="/r/stronglifts">r/stronglifts</a>, <a href="/r/powerlifting">r/powerlifting</a> etc., without having any remote interest in any of their subs. Reddit saw that I&#39;d clicked this sub and just assumed those other &quot;related&quot; ones needed to be given to me too.</p>

<p>I think you have a lot of basic gym &quot;exercisers&quot; who get fed this sub from the Reddit algorithm and just blindly post on the thread. Admittedly, they should read before they post, but most people are stupid and lazy, so it doesn&#39;t surprise me when they do it.</p>

<p>That said, I do think things like non-conventional deadlifts (here&#39;s looking at you sumo) should not be allowed on here. The books don&#39;t cover it. The Starting Strength material is clear about why, and advocates it nowhere with the exception of the 1% who are planning on being a high level competitive lifter.</p>

<div class="md"><p>If the thread has nothing to do with SS or PPST, delete it. Instead of giving lengthy responses to questions answered in the books, simply post a link to the book. I 100% understand why Rip is crabby and a bit of an internet troll after dealing with this for years. He’s built an entire website and filled it with information over and over and over just for people to be too lazy or stubborn to do some light reading. It’s exhausting.</p>
