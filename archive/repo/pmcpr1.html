Glutes are dead, won't work.

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I recently began trying to strengthen my glutes because I realized, they are severely under-used. However, when I&#39;m doing lateral side steps with a resistance band around my ankles, I hardly feel anything in my glutes. Instead, it is my TFL&#39;s that start to burn.</p>

<p>How can I remedy this?</p>

<div class="md"><p>do hip thrust while on your back. Make sure to hold on the top of the contraction. Lateral side steps involve th gluteus medius I believe, the hip thrust from the floor usually incorporate the whole glute. Also, have you done any mobility?</p>

<div class="md"><p>dynamic stretching is closest I can put it. For example, if you&#39;re doing squats in a workout, it would be beneficial to do mobility for that move, holding a deep squat for 1-2 minutes, hip thrusts to turn on the glutes, all will help for the squat. You are having decreased neural drive to your glutes, mobility to identify muscle imbalances, and a move like hip thrusts will increase that neural drive. Sorry I tried to explain it in a coherent way lol</p>

<div class="md"><p>Don&#39;t know why I&#39;ve never thought of internal rotation but the moment you said it a light bulb went off in my head. Def trying this with myself and some clients.</p>

<div class="md"><p>Are your glutes &quot;dead?&quot; Pretty sure not unless you have some serious nerve damage. Perhaps doing resistance band lateral steps isn&#39;t enough resistance to &quot;feel&quot; them. Also, if your goal is the &quot;strengthen&quot; your glutes, then I think doing band work that is typically used for a warmup is not particularly useful.  Have you tried doing heavy barbell glute raises instead? How are your deadlift and squats?</p>

<div class="md"><p>&quot;Dead butt syndrome&quot; is a thing, Google it.  Much more common now since so many people are sitting in front of computers and TVs more.  Two of my favorite exercises to re-establish that motor pattern in somebody who is dealing with this:</p>

<p>1)  Single leg hip bridge, lying on your back on the floor: <a href="https://youtu.be/q8Qni6UyKPk">https://youtu.be/q8Qni6UyKPk</a></p>

<p>2) &quot;whale tail&quot; - lying on your front, knees bent at a right angle, knees WIDE, toes TURNED OUT and heels TOUCHING (so your legs and feet are making a whale tail) - squeeze the heels into each other and lift the thighs off the floor a little bit WITHOUT pressing the stomach into the floor.   If you work at it, you can get it so you&#39;re isolated down to just the glutes and not using the spinal muscles.</p>
