The only frugal, high protein diet is 3 x 40 grams of protein in Huel for 120 grams of protein.

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Let me show you a healthy, affordable meal: $1.20 in collard greens for fiber and $1.90 for 40 grams of protein in a Huel shake.</p>

<p>If this isn’t your meal for $3, I don’t trust what’s in your stomach.</p>

<p>The last time I mentioned Huel.com (for homelessness), a fitness type insulted me for talking about a protein shake with fake vitamins.</p>

<p>Huel.com is an affordable “meal” for $1.90, with a better micronutrient split than eggs. I would be happy for homeless guys to be on their zinc to say the least.</p>

<p>Huel is not just protein like Ensure. Huel is enough fiber to pass a complete stool. It is also high quality pea protein, omega-3 ALA, and unadulterated omega-6 LA.</p>

<p>To eat cheap and healthy, let me recommend Huel Black. I am a big fan of Coffee Caramel as desert in a cup. It even has 60 mg of caffeine. All of the Huel Black flavors have been worth experimenting with.</p>

<p>The dork nutrient is EGCG, but it is so low in milligrams for the smallest hormesis effect. I couldn’t imagine the day I would ever say “You had me at EGCG.”</p>

<p>The other product Huel 3.0 has a sandpaper texture and distinctly tastes like an engineered food alternative.</p>

<p>Cheers.</p>
