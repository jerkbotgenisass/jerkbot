<div class="md"><p>As a woman, used to be an athlete now a weight lifter. Most of the time when I think about this, I am paying attention to my progress and how much mass I build. I also think about my metabolism and how I wish I could eat more instead of having to limit myself. The thing that crosses my mind regularly is “wow , my goals would be so much more achievable if I had more testosterone “ </p>

<p>It sucks becuse I workout so much, but if my macros are off, or I have a cheat weekend/ week of for an event or vacation everything is so thrown off. I know it’s like that for everyone, but so many people don’t understand that most of us women have to eat less than 1600 calories a day to be at maintenance or lose weight. Some of us, under 1400. It sucks, especially when you’re a fat bitch at heart like me and want to eat everything. </p>

<p>Also, there’s definitely a stigma against women being “big” versus men being “big”. </p>

<p>I’m actually a lesbian, so male opinions about me don’t matter to me. I love to build muscle, I want to look buff and strong. But, as a woman who has been living in this society of ours I always have the underlying but overwhelming feeling I look so damn  awkward all the time for my muscle mass.</p>

<div class="md"><p>I just had this conversation with my girl.</p>

<p>I’d say all or almost all girls know that any guy can overpower them easily if it comes to that. Which isn’t scary per se, but the thought lingers in some situations like walking alone at night or Tinder dates and forced them to be cautious. At the societal level it necessitates that we establish hard violence boundaries (you never slap a girl, etc).</p>

<p>Not a big conversation to be had tbh. Just a fact of the world.</p>

<div class="md"><p>No it’s simply just that, the topic of body types and stuff comes up pretty often between us. Her ex was 60/135, objectively a tiny human, and still was stronger than her (50/154). All girls I’ve been with are that weight or less. I’m 90/200.</p>

<p>We honestly talk about bodies and sizes too much, and it is I’m sure a result of my own subconscious fixation with the topic. I should stop caring about it.</p>

<div class="md"><p>Oh no, I don&#39;t disagree at all. Height, weight, bones mass, muscle percentage vs fat percentage, testosterone, etc. So many factors that help men to kinda &quot;be on steroids&quot; raw-strength wise compared to women. 100% agree.</p>

<div class="md"><p>Strength is a skill. Compound lifts, particularly your big 3, are especially so. Good technique goes a long way. You’ve had longer to develop that skill. 
I think the topic of the conversation is more that a man could potentially meet or surpass your lift in a shorter time span. The propensity for men to get stronger is obviously much more prevalent than for women.</p>

<div class="md"><p>I am a guy, but I have wrestled with a lot of women on the ground during bjj/grappling and I would say the strength difference feels less notable than most people expect. An out of shape skinny fat guy can be surprisingly weak even compared to a smaller but athletic female.</p>

<p>It seems larger, when it comes to striking. Women seem to really struggle with moving their arms explosively.</p>

<div class="md"><p>Interesting the thing about striking, never would&#39;ve thought about that precisely. But yes totally a well trained woman can definitely overpoweer the average guy. Although I think it&#39;d depend on the size of said average guy too.</p>

<div class="md"><p>I&#39;m female, 6&#39;, pretty muscular and curvy and NOT small. And I&#39;ve dated a lot, mostly men who also work out, and some who didnt.  I will tell you - even with the men who didn&#39;t work out, they are much MUCH more powerful than me. I am keenly aware than all men are stronger than me and, although I feel like my size makes me a less likely target, I also sympathize with how women who are smaller than me must feel because even I feel it.</p>

<div class="md"><p>I always thought women were almost as strong as men in the lower body. Legs hips butt etc. upper body a bit more different.

<div class="md"><p>It&#39;s part of the story/argument/question. </p>

<p>I&#39;m not asking women to talk how they&#39;d feel exactly about me or compared to me. I&#39;m telling a story to create a picture so that I can get my point across. I&#39;m not here for ego stroking, I already know most men are bigger than women. I don&#39;t even understand how would stating such an obvious fact would enhance my ego.</p>
