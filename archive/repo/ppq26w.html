<div class="md"><p>Man this sub is a dump. </p>

<p>Every comment on is about getting a spotter or telling him to dump the weight when he clearly has a plan for failure and used it. We get it, none of you have any idea what you are talking about so you need to play the parrot or clutch at pearls so you can hear yourselves talk. </p>

<p>Try including the lift off and set up next time. Those are just as important. You cut straight to having the bar in your hands and that makes it hard to give advice on those areas. It&#39;s hard to say without those parts, but it looks like you just assembled all the parts of technique without putting them together. You have an arch, you are trying to use your legs, you have your shoulders retracted and chest out (I think) but all those things alone don&#39;t do much for you. You need to have the weight stacked properly on your arms down to your upper back to the bench. On a good unrack you can &#39;feel&#39; a very strong continuous column from the bar on down. I don&#39;t think you have that here. </p>

<p>Beyond that obviously get bigger and stronger but that goes without saying really.</p>

<div class="md"><p>You can widen your grip a little. Looks like you’ve got a big wingspan, it might help. Worth a shot. Tuck your shoulder blades. Grab it like you’re bending the bar. You’re close. Oh and arch your back. Proper form is everything.</p>

<div class="md"><p>The amount of faux concern in this sub is unreal.</p>

<p>When you have already read 30 people say OMG YOU NEED A SPOTTER why would you yourself repeat this asanine comment? What is the fucking point?</p>

<p>He has spotter arms on his bench for one.</p>

<p>Honestly, what pointless drivel.</p>

<p>Do a proper program and eat a lot. Simple.</p>

<div class="md"><p>The point is to drive the importance of a spotter. The &quot; spotter arms&quot; as you call them didn&#39;t do much here did they? A spotter could help get passed that sticking point, can add a level of safety and even allow focus on making the lift instead of worrying about what to do if you fail. Now having sound advice like work a proper program and eat is also kind of worthless in your view as you have no idea about this guys workout plan or eating habits.</p>

<div class="md"><p>I disagree with the importance of a spotter, especially when he has safeties on his rack which have already performed their job in this video.</p>

<p>I think its pointless concern trolling. One person saying it is pointless enough, but 30+ people parroting it whilst offering no advice on how to increase his bench press? Whats the point?</p>

<p>I dont really have any idea about this guys programming or diet, but given he doesnt know how to improve what looks like an 85kg bench, and seems pretty skinny.... It stands to reason that his programming is poor and his diet is also not good enough.</p>

<div class="md"><p>So you dont think a spotter could help getting past that sticking point and finishing the lift would help? A spotter is a million times better than those safety racks as in order to use them during the lift he would have to push the weight over his head into the rack. Over his neck. Tweeking his shoulders. Dont get me wrong, power racks with proper safety arms are worth their weight in gold but are also 100 times easier to use with a spotter. Try it yourself, put some weight on the bar, drop it to your chest and roll it to the arms of the rack. Then think about had you just missed that weight and are fatigued. Its just not that easy.</p>

<p>I mean, yeah it would get him past the sticking point, but its 1 rep. How much training stimulus is it going to have? </p>

<p>He&#39;d be better of staying away from any maxing out and just following a proper program.</p>
