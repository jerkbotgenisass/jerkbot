<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I&#39;ve always found it incredibly time consuming and frustrating to meet my goals each and every day. If I could eat the same thing every day and get all the nutrients I need, I would do it. I practically have been for the past 4 years anyway with shakes and eggs every day. I will take any shortcuts or cheats I can get. Are there other people out there? A subreddit maybe?</p>

<div class="md"><p>Complete opposite for me lol. I wake up and have next to no appetite. Lunch and especially dinner are my biggest meals. Breakfast is usually like a granola bar and a protein shake or chocolate milk. Lunch is just generic school lunch (sandwich, cheese, yogurt, applesauce, etc), and then dinner is whatever my mom makes. Yesterday was homemade Zupa Tuscana, and I had like 5 bowls, 2 servings of salad, and a good 3-4 slices of French bread with the soup.</p>

<div class="md"><p>It&#39;s not even the eating (which honestly already sucks when you&#39;re eating 3000+ calories) but everything around it as else. I love cooking, but on the days I&#39;m working I&#39;m exhausted, then I have my work out sessions  and THEN I  have to think about what I want to eat, go shopping and then cook it. If I could eat a pill that made me as full and had all the necessary nutrients on those days I&#39;d do it in a heartbeat. I love food but it exhausts me</p>
