Quick question for men who've had a big weight loss..

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Just wondering if any of the men on here have had a substantial weight loss, and could comment on their pubic area (like the &#39;pubic mound&#39; above/around your cock).</p>

<p>&#x200B;</p>

<p>You often hear people say that losing a little weight will result in your cock looking bigger, as the mound is obviously mostly fat and will shrink back. However, I&#39;ve also heard the opposite in that the mound itself obviously can&#39;t really be exercised specifically, and that fat loss there can be stubborn and it can become a bit &#39;deflated&#39; looking and not very sightly.</p>

<p>&#x200B;</p>

<p>Was just wondering if anyone with any actual real-world experience of this had a comment to make on it, at all? I presume it&#39;s something that would cross the minds of most men who are aiming to lose a good bit of weight?</p>

<p>&#x200B;</p>

<p>Cheers.</p>

<p>My mons pubis lost weight.    It definitely had a positive-looking effect.  Things tend to &quot;work better&quot; too.  </p>

<blockquote>

<p>We don&#39;t lose weight with exercise.  Our body burns fat due to a caloric deficit.  Anywhere there is stored fat, the body can take from that area when burning fat.    (There is a rare condition <em>lipedema</em> where this is not true, but it is rare and doesn&#39;t affect this part of the body.)</p>

<p>Final words:  This is making your house look better by excavating the yard.  Don&#39;t forget to trim the hedges a bit, too; it helps.</p>

<div class="md"><p>There is a nsfw subreddit called /nakedprogress that has some examples of peoples journey.  If you were curious you could see those examples of how the weight loss affected them.</p>

<div class="md"><p>Cheers. I&#39;ve actually followed that for a while in the past, but lost interest when it was just random naked selfies.</p>

<p>&#x200B;</p>

<p>It&#39;s really helpful when people post in a before/after kinda way, but a random naked picture with nothing to compare to makes it a bit pointless, in my opinion.</p>

<div class="md"><p>It’s true that you can’t target areas for weight loss.  My cushion definitely got smaller (not sure at which point) and sex is way better after losing 80lbs</p>

<div class="md"><p>Some of fat there is desirable to cushion the banging. So there will be an amount of fat really difficult to cut.</p>

<p>For a more overweight person this should be more visible but no so much. </p>

<p>I think the reduction in abdomen would help more to create the illusion is sticking out more.</p>

<div class="md"><p>There is no thing as spot fat reduction, and you can’t control how much fat is lost on specific places. But losing 50-60 lbs should get you an extra inch.</p>
