Can I just melt down and drink straight fat to get my extra calories?

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I&#39;m trying to bulk on carnivore, and also do omad (I&#39;d prefer not to but I&#39;m stuck working 15 hour days from dawn and so one big meal before bed is kinda my only option).</p>

<p>So far, to be getting my necessary calories in, I&#39;ve been buying beef fat trimmings from my local butcher, melting them down in a big pot and then storing them in a mason jar in the fridge. Come dinner time, I&#39;ll fill a glass with the fat, microwave it, and then drink the glass of liquid fat along with my ground beef and eggs.</p>

<p>I definitely feel better the next day if I have plenty of fat, much less hunger, but it occurred to me the other day that this might not be healthy to do long-term, or that there might be better ways of achieving a caloric surplus within a small eating window.</p>

<p>Any and all suggestions and advice would be greatly appreciated. Thank you in advance.</p>

<div class="md"><p>&quot;this might not be healthy to do long-term&quot;</p>

<p>We are bombarded with the notion that fat is bad for us, every commercial, every article, everyone you speak to etc. etc. that is why you are thinking this.</p>

<p>eg. Apparently, you get Plant butter now... lol I heard an ad on the radio and the ad kept going on about how dirty and contaminated animals are and how pure and clean plants are &quot;If you like butter, You&#39;ll LOVE plant butter.&quot; &quot;Heart healthy&quot; &quot;Clean and pure&quot; &quot;no more worrying about dying&quot;   it probably said &quot;clean and pure&quot; about 20+ times in one ad. </p>

<p>It kind of felt like it was like a mantra, they kept saying over and over &quot;clean and pure&quot;&quot;clean and pure&quot;&quot;clean and pure&quot;&quot;clean and pure&quot;</p>

<div class="md"><p>I think we&#39;ve had a misunderstanding. I don&#39;t think fat is unhealthy. But I suspect that maybe melting it down and drinking straight for months or years at a time might disagree with my digestive health. Just a suspicion, couldn&#39;t actually tell you why I have it, but that&#39;s half the reason I made this post, so people could either confirm my suspicions for me or reassure me there&#39;s no risk.</p>

<p>Eggs absorb loads of fat. They&#39;ll  absorb loads of of butter/tallow/ etc, if you make scrambled eggs</p>

<div class="md"><p>I would skip melting the tallow, just eat it with your food while you chew your other food. Don&#39;t drink your calories. I mean if your body can take it without complications, and makes you feel better, go for it. If not, better eat it, you get better satiety feeling.</p>

<div class="md"><p>I use it to treat schizophrenia. I found the ketogenic aspect a lot more helpful than the carnivore aspect, which is why I do that. It’s been a miracle. When I first got sick, I got put on the highest dose of antipsychotic and I was still very symptomatic - paranoid, hallucinating, and delusional. Therapeutic keto removed most of my symptoms and gave me so many faculties of my mind back, some I’ve never had even before getting sick. For example, my synesthesia became a lot more pronounced. I saw little inklings of it growing up, but it’s a lot stronger now. One of the best things is I struggled with socializing growing up. I would always be at a loss for words and just wasn’t good with people. Before medical keto, I just learned these skills from books and friends and manually applied them. As I got adapted, socializing came very naturally to me - empathy, theory of mind, reading cues, interpreting body language, finding words to say, etc… just turned “on”.</p>

<p>I do 85 G protein. I don’t exceed it and haven’t in ages. It’s more of a medicine than a diet. If I change anything, it’s after a lot of thought and advice. I will say I’m pretty physically active - 3 x lifting per week, 15 miles per week, 10-20k steps a day. I’m still making good gains and having a blast exercising. The diet has been great, despite the low protein and somewhat high physical activity.</p>

<p>I do work with a medical keto dietitian though.</p>

<div class="md"><p>It’s a version of keto usually used to treat epilepsy, but recently, many people are finding it useful for treating other illnesses. </p>

<p>What you’re most likely familiar with is nutritional keto. The states are the same - ketosis, but medical keto has some modifications to make sure you’re not only in ketosis but your ketones are high and consistently so.</p>

<p>Nutritional keto:
Carbs are a limit (Can go under)
Protein is a target (can exceed)
Fat is a limit (Can go under)
Can hit macros however you want in a day</p>

<p>Therapeutic keto:
20-40 g carbs (must hit exact amount)
Protein is a target (must hit exact amount)
Fat is a target (must hit exact amount)
A fat - carb - protein ratio must be maintained in. a meal to meal basis</p>

<p>Therapeutic keto is fragile and a lot less forgiving but I found it absurdly powerful.</p>

<div class="md"><p>I&#39;ve found that by eating multiple smaller protein meals throughout the day I can eat to satiety and still have moderately high ketones. Think: a few hundred grams of Gouda cheese, a few hundred grams of ribsteak, ~30 gr scoop of collagen in water etc. I snack on butter, so much butter.</p>

<p>I&#39;m moderately active, averaging 5,000 - 7,500 steps per day and I do some light resistance training when I feel like it. I have pretty bad emphysema</p>

<div class="md"><p>I&#39;m really trying to do this diet dairy free for the first 2 months to see what results i get and then introducing dairy bit by bit, so for now cheese isn&#39;t an option. Any other ideas?</p>
