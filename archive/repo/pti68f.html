How long and what does it take to get a body as defined as someone like Hugh Jackman in Wolverine?

<div class="post">
<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I&#39;ve been doing everything by the book for about a year now. Lost 40 kgs. Was down to 59 kgs from a 100 kgs a year ago at 5 feet 10 and had finally started seeing abs etc. However I was on a huge calorie deficit, was working out 3 times a day and was feeling weak, angry, helpless and had developed body dysmorphia. Fast forward a month or so, I have gained about 4 kgs and am still working out a lot however I just don&#39;t see my body ever looking like a body builder. I was at 6.8 percent body fat 2 months ago which was unhealthy as hell and am at 8.9 rn. Unfortunately I just feel bloated, irritable etc and don&#39;t really know why I&#39;m putting in all that effort at the gym. Some guy at the gym told me that I&#39;ll never get to an actor&#39;s level because 1) I&#39;ve been fat and obese 25 years of my life 2) genes 3) those guys solely focus on fitness throughout the day</p>

<p>One thing to note is that when I was down to 59, I had quit alcohol and any sort of binges, cheat days / meals etc. Now I go out with my friends once a week and get drunk and was wondering if that is the reason why I can&#39;t see results though I doubt it because I do go to the gym for 2 hours plus keep doing pushups whenever I get the time. I see people at the gym spending half as much as time as me but getting much better results, getting bigger muscles etc, however when I try to gain muscle and go on a calorie surplus, all I see is fat or lose mass or whatever that is on my stomach. Unfortunately my weight also keeps fluctuating and I feel terrible for not being 59kgs tbh. I know this is a psychological problem as well but I just want to know more about fitness and what parts of the puzzle am I missing including genetics, etc</p>

<p>PS I&#39;m also scared as hell even if I gain a pound. I know it might be a pound of muscle but I have no way of telling</p>

<div class="md"><p>On top of an insanely strict diet and full time all day committment to weight lifting, Hugh Jackman was dangerously dehydrated before shooting all those scenes to get the definition they wanted to see. It was not at all a natural state, and required constant monitoring for safety. He himself came out and said he would not recommend anyone try to emulate it. Most body builders only look that defined a few days a year, for competition. It&#39;s an entirely unrealistic and unhealthy standard and expectation for men, similar to most supermodel photoshopped pictures being a ridiculous and mostly unattainable standard for women. </p>

<p>I get it. I see photoshopped pictures of models everywhere I look, and no matter how hard I try I have days where I feel like a failure when I have to admit I&#39;ll never look like that. It&#39;s hard. Set reasonable goals for yourself, talk to a doctor and nutritionist if you want solid medical advice and supervision on how far you can push yourself safely, track your progress, and try not to let other people&#39;s comments or expectations define who you want to be.</p>

<div class="md"><p>I read a great article in..I want to say Vice?...but it was a first person account of a Male Fitness Model. It was absolutely brutal to maintain <em>that look</em> for even just a few hours. The guys were dangerously dehydrating themselves daily and on extreme caloric cuts. The day of the shoot, most of the guys had eaten a handful of gummy bears and were drunk on cheap wine to stay dehydrated and vascular.</p>

<p>That Wolverine look is super dangerous, unrealistic, and not even all that attractive to potential partners. Try going after the Hugh Jackman look portrayed in magazines like Good Housekeeping, not Men&#39;s Fitness.</p>

<div class="md"><p>Hugh had been playing Wolverine for 14 years by the time The Wolverine came out.  If you have to go with him, aim for what he looked like in 2000.  </p>

<p>And even then, he had probably six months, a live-in coach and chef and no other obligations other than family time to deal with.</p>

<div class="md"><p>He did exactly that for the 1st Xmen, he did no training and the director told him he wasn&#39;t looking right so all the topless shots from the 1st film were done at the end of 6 months of shooting. What you see in the 1st xmen film is his natural body with 6-8 months of focused training and good diet.</p>

<p>In later films he was definitely sauced putting on huge amounts of weight in 6-10 months before shooting.</p>

<p>The only film he did not do this was Logan, and you can tell.</p>

<p>If you look at his natural frame, even when he was a young man in his prime there is no way he was getting ripped like he was in Wolverine at his age without sauce</p>

<p>Edit: Just for clarity he did not stay in shape for his role as wolverine between films, he would literally start months before shooting with nearly tripling his exercise load so he was springing between his normal body weight and then a few months later putting on the size for shoots.</p>

<div class="md"><p>I&#39;m sure he took some PEDs, but this could also be achieved with a combination of practical effects, makeup, and lighting. I&#39;d agree this is achievable naturally for people willing to work and diet hard with good genes and enough time (and realistic expectations that this would be like peak day for a Photoshoot in similarly good lightning and effects), but let&#39;s be honest. There&#39;s really 0 reason to not use PEDs as an actor when millions are on the line. I mean if you think about the time and money that goes into a film, delaying it because your star isn&#39;t in shape isn&#39;t an option when delaying costs you hundreds of thousands a day or needing to cgi your star will cost an extra million. Why on earth wouldn&#39;t they just opt to spend a couple grand on the best PEDs you can buy? If you get them there with time to spare - great. But I really really doubt that&#39;s a gamble most productions are willing to take for a superhero film unless that actor was renown for being in excellent condition year round</p>

<div class="md"><p>Bro there are options besides either no steroid use and blasting massive amounts of gear like a lot of bodybuilders. A lot of Hollywood actors run a very basic light cycle to avoid side-effects and long term health effects, and also makes their physique seem more realistic (but still out of reach for like 90% of natty people. That&#39;s why they often look shredded or buff, but not HUGE. That pic you linked of Ben Pollack isn&#39;t even that far off of from <a href="http://beta.ems.ladbiblegroup.com/s3/content/4377250657fb24dff0d3d76f71773f6b.jpg">this one</a> minus a little bit of size. </p>

<p>But it isn&#39;t just gear, having access to things like personal trainers, dietitians, and the free time money affords to workout constantly; gear also helps significantly reduce recovery time even in low doses.</p>

<div class="md"><p>Oh I&#39;m sure. But there&#39;s also a <em>lot</em> of options for you before you even touch steroid&#39;s.</p>

<p>This is my point: it is as disingenuous to claim everybody remotely lean in Hollywood is on steroid as it is to claim that nobody in Hollywood is on steroids. Because honestly, what&#39;s to stop him from maintaining a baseline amount of muscle year round, especially if he&#39;s already contracted to play in movies where he&#39;s required to be shirtless? </p>

<p>Dude was lean. He wasn&#39;t humungous. It took him <em>10 years</em> to put on something like 25lbs of lean mass? A quick google search shows that he&#39;s 6&#39;3 and 190lbs during The Wolverine. For the example I listed above, Ben Pollack, in the 2018 photo, was 181lbs at 5&#39;8. Which he achieved while training for powerlifting while doing his Ph. D</p>

<div class="md"><p>From a guy who was formerly in the industry, it&#39;s not that Hugh Jackman is a millionaire.  He&#39;s not paying for shit.  He has a billion dollar studio behind him that fronts that payment to very specific trainers in the industry.  The guys from 300?  There&#39;s a few youtube videos out there on their training and regimen via the studio.  </p>

<p>You ask about insta models and ripped people at the gym...  keep this in mind:  1 out of 50 people are just going to have great genes.  Genes that require very little work for very big results.  Some can eat whatever they want, whenever they want.  They have perfect symmetry and life is pretty much easy for them.  Social media allowed all these people a medium for them to advertise themselves and whatever product would pay them to push it.  And that allowed them to take a more narcissistic approach to their lifestyle.  And it paid well and other people wanted to jump on board.  And now you have a virus that can&#39;t stop.  IGNORE THOSE PEOPLE.  </p>

<p>Having been on keto since 2018, I can tell you that this is not an expensive &quot;diet plan&quot;, as you put it.  A training regimen can be what you make it (I invested into a home gym).  Surgery?  Are you serious?  Age gracefully.  Look at all the guys out there who have taken good care of themselves (i.e. stretching, working out, watching what they eat, overall skin care) and tell me they don&#39;t look better at 60 than the majority of people you know at 40.  Drugs?  If you&#39;re going the steroid route, then you have some mental issues you&#39;re going to need to overcome before any of this is going to make sense to you.  If you&#39;re going the HGH route, there are relatively cheap methods to procure it and use it so that you feel healthy and lean without getting crazy like some people.  And you certainly don&#39;t need personal staff to do anything.  You need a scheduler, dedication to time, focus on meals, and commitment.  Personally, I&#39;m a much better person with keto.  It taught me a lot about myself, organization, and what I could accomplish.  </p>

<p>But the truth is, I&#39;m not a guy without faults.  The pendulum is swinging the other way for me right now.  I&#39;m full of stress, disorganized, I took up smoking again for the first time in 20 years, my diet is shit, and I feel like shit.  I guess I want you to know that not everyone who spouts info on Reddit is without flaws.  I just need some personal time off to get my shit together, figure out a plan, and reintegrate into the greatness that once was.  I&#39;m targeting October 1st to make that happen.  And I&#39;m getting really excited about it because I know what life is like when I do the things I explain above.  Sometimes you have to hit a low to really appreciate the highs.  If it&#39;s high all the time and you make that your &quot;norm&quot;, then you don&#39;t know how to deal with the lows should they come... and they will. </p>

<p>Commit to yourself.  Do this for you (not for anyone else).  Start small, bite off a little, chew, and see if you like it.  See if you can maintain it and turn it into a habit.  Then bite off a little more, chew, and see if you like integrating that.  If you take on too much, too fast, you will NOT succeed.  It takes 28 days to form a habit.  If you&#39;re trying to change 3 things about you immediately, it&#39;s going to be very difficult, not fun, not enjoyable, and it&#39;s going to stress you out to the point that you&#39;re going to drop it entirely.  This is, unfortunately, human nature.  You&#39;re getting ready to embark on a huge journey for yourself.  Take the time to plan your route, what you need to bring with you, and how you&#39;re going to survive.  Then take the first step.</p>

<p>It&#39;ll be the first step of the rest of your life.</p>

<div class="md"><p>It starts with not worrying about your friends.  Easier said than done, right?  Once I realized life wasn&#39;t fair, I started assessing my own life and realistic expectations for self.  Remember that your friends likely had a very different upbringing than you (i.e. socioeconomic status, parents, diet, drive, etc.) Their experiences were not your experiences and your path is not their path.  Focus on you--because it&#39;s ALL you can do.  Anything else will just make you depressed (it sounds like), and lead to unhealthy thoughts.  When you internalize, and make the progress about YOU, and not compare yourself to THEM, it becomes manageable.  You want the world right now rather than just trying to figure out where you&#39;re going to eat next (metaphor).  </p>

<p>We all let the pendulum swing the other way every once in awhile.  Don&#39;t beat yourself up over it.  Instead, take this time away to know that you&#39;re allowing yourself to do it for only a specific amount of time before you&#39;re going to make a single change... then another... then another.  Baby steps.  You might not get to posing abs at Ibiza beach parties, but you&#39;ll be a lot closer than you were yesterday.</p>

<div class="md"><p>You want the same body as the others? Find out what works for you and theN decide if its worth it! As does everyone else. For some its harder, for some other aspects of lufe are harder. Being attractive is not about looking like a model, its about feeling comfortable in your own skin, this can also be achieved when you just accept that you are that way. I personally work out every day, not because i want to look good, its because i want to perform well in my sports. And sometimes i do 1 or 2 extra exercises that are for looks only. I would never have the motivation to work out for looks only if it werent fun in itself.</p>

<p>Also everyone is different and you have to find your way. And also insta is a lie, thats just how it is! Every picture is staged! If you want zo take picture like them look for youtubevids about lighting and pump yourself up before you do them. Thats the easiest way to have nice looking pictures. And they will be as fake as everyone elses. I would recommend not living a fake life and acknowledging, that others indeed do.</p>

Actors typically don&#39;t go nuts with steroids like a lot of bodybuilders, they usually run a pretty light cycle to avoid side effects and long-term health effects. The access to things like personal trainers, nutritionists, and the free time to workout all day every day (steroids also help with this as they significantly decrease recovery time. Taylor Lautner said while he was prepping for twilight he was eating high protein meals/snacks every 2-3 hours, to the point where his trainer would wake him up just to eat and then he&#39;d go back to sleep.</p>

<div class="md"><p>Using celebrities as an end-goal for body composition for us &quot;normal&quot; people, is usually not a sustainable approach.</p>

<p>Fitness is a long-term process. It&#39;s not a quick-fix, whatever all those fitness &quot;gurus&quot; and &quot;influencers&quot; claim. It&#39;s not only about dropping a massive amount of weight during a short window of time (which in itself can cause hormonal issues)</p>

<p>As many people said, celebrities with ripped physiques have different resources than most of us. Their physiques are simply not realistic representations of what is feasible for the &quot;common man&quot;.</p>

<p>They are able to hire expensive personal trainers, have access to the best of foods and also performance-enhancing substances (yes, it&#39;s naive to think a majority of them are not using those). And, one of the bigger points; they have time. It&#39;s their job to look like they do, so they can dedicate time and energy to it. Most of us has to squeeze our workouts in between jobs, kids and &quot;real life&quot;.</p>

<p>Also, listening to &quot;bro&#39;s&quot; at the gym will mostly be unproductive. Many simply have no basic understanding of the physiology of muscle growth, fat loss, and such outside the realm of whatever fitness influencer they are following or exotic &quot;cocktail&quot; they&#39;re sipping on between breaks in sets.</p>

<p>Some questions for you:</p>

<ol>
<li>What&#39;s the reason for wanting to look like Hugh Jackman. Don&#39;t get me wrong; I dig his physique, but it&#39;s not naturally attainable.</li>
<li>If you are under 10% body fat then you are lean enough for muscle definition to show. I&#39;m not sure if I&#39;m reading your numbers correctly, though. If so, what is the reason for wanting to be below those already low numbers, given that those aren&#39;t numbers that are maintainable over the long term?</li>
<li>What are your long-term goals, not only body composition-wise but HEALTH wise as well? Dropping 40kg in a year is a massive weight loss over a relatively short amount of time. I&#39;m not sure how a body will cope with such a sudden change in weight hormonally before getting used to its new &quot;set-point&quot;.</li>
</ol>

<p>Also, if you were overweight/obese, good job in dropping that weight. That alone has saved you from a plethora of lifestyle-related diseases and ailments. You&#39;ve already done a massive change in your body. Making another big change, like looking like Hugh Jackman, would be shocking and probably not a step in a healthy direction.</p>

<p>Can you build muscle? Of course! Regardless of genetics the same principles for muscle growth apply. Maybe you need to find some more serious guidance, from a professional, certified trainer and maybe establish a more long-term plan.</p>

<p>13 years of sliding towards more extreme versions of what a &#39;ripped&#39; guy looks like. Plus lots of training and extreme dehydration.</p>

<p>That would definitely be a big reason why you&#39;re feeling bad. Alcohol is a poison - especially for someone on Keto.</p>

<p>What I&#39;m not seeing is the amount of protein you&#39;re eating? Don&#39;t be afraid up that stuff, man. Heap it up.</p>
