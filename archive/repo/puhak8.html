<div class="md"><p>A couple of things: </p>

<ul>
<li><p>your stance is off. Start with your foundation: hips, legs, feet - keep your hips legs and feet under you.  Straighten up your feet. They should be more aligned going north and south with a slight angle pointing outwards. Currently your feet are too outwards pointed. </p></li>
<li><p>flexibility would be next: ensure that you have good wrist flexibly. Do this by gently stretching your fingers with one hand to reach your wrists. If your wrists can barely move you need to change your grip of the front squat and work on wrist mobility over time </p></li>
<li><p>front squat grip. Instead of holding the bar like you are. Place your right hand to your left shoulder and left hand to your right shoulder. Next, while keeping your hands in the position raise your elbows so they are parallel to the floor. Squat like this without any weight. Once you become comfortable you will have to add the bar. The bar should rest on the front of your shoulders/upper chest while you maintain your elbows at parallel to the floor throughoutthe squat movement. This form is great for those with poor wrists flexibility. However it is dangerous to execute without a squat rack if you are using a barbell with weights.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>For someone who just started exercising you have great muscle definition. </p>

<p>Keep working young man!</p>

<div class="md"><p>Thank you for this description. I have a ton of trouble holding the front squat in the “traditional” way because my shoulders and wrists don’t seem to want to cooperate. This gives me an alternative</p>

<div class="md"><p>As you work on getting your base right it might be worthwhile to start with goblet squats to get comfortable with the movement and weight being in front of your body.</p>

<div class="md"><p>To start, you don’t want to be carrying the weight of the bar in your hands. Ideally you want the bar resting on your shoulders and balanced/held in place with your hands. You may need to work on your wrist flexibility to get there but you want your elbows up at 90 degrees from your body. If you can get the bar resting more on your shoulders it should allow you to “sit” into the squat more (essentially help you balance and distribute the weight better). This should help you work your core and glutes a little more. 
If you feel like you’re being pulled forward by the weight I think these are things that can help.
I recommend watching YouTube videos...</p>

<div class="md"><p>Glad you mentioned elbows at 90 degrees. I know someone who broke both her wrists doing heavy front squats because her elbows were down and she hit them on her knees/legs under a heavy load.</p>

<div class="md"><p>First- front squat should be set up on a rack so that you’re able to get under the bar in order to get the bar on your clavicle. Start there. 
Elbows should be up.<br/>
Bar should not be away from your body</p>

<p>If you want to get better- YouTube should be your friend :)</p>

<div class="md"><p>Bar should be resting on your upper chest/collar bone.
*Edit: Have always wanted to do this but have never received 11 upvotes before. I’ve been working on my front rack for 6-7 yrs easily.</p>

<div class="md"><p>You really need to watch some videos on proper squat technique, as well as how to hold the bar when doing a front squat (there are basically 2 ways). Please please educate yourself before attempting next time, your form is a setup for bad habits and future injury, a bad combination.</p>

<div class="md"><p>Aside from your form, which obviously has to be corrected (as already suggested by a lot of people), I’m concerned with your stance: I’m not sure about it, but if you have flat feet it might be better to lift with proper shoes on.</p>

<div class="md"><p>Not enough mentions about this. Your arches are collapsing severely and your knees are tracking about 45 degrees inside the lines your feet are making. You want those knees to track as close to the line each foot makes as you can get them.</p>

<div class="md"><p>This. Shoulder discomfort while lifting is temporary.  Torn knee ligaments are forever.</p>

<p>This is something you can get away with for maybe a few years, then you’ll start having serious knee issues once you outpace your body’s ability to compensate.</p>
