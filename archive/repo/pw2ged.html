My six month journey from very underweight to healthy (25M; 5'7" /130lb -> 147lb; mid March to mid September)

<div class="post">
<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Alright, I&#39;m going to try to keep this as objective as possible, so bear with me. I&#39;ll put this in the beginning just to get it out of the way: </p>

<p><a href="http://imgur.com/a/gTJtyqL">Start</a> / <a href="http://imgur.com/a/AdqKRNv">3 Months</a> / <a href="http://imgur.com/a/BP3SrIG">6 Months</a> </p>

<p>Some older background: Luckily for myself, I&#39;ve always been fairly athletic and played a bunch of sports growing up, including baseball, football, and basketball. I had never really considered my weight an issue, as I felt I was fairly muscular because I played sports. </p>

<p>Some newer background: Right before this, I was drinking somewhere between 3-6 beers a day. I was also only eating maybe two meals a day. Pair that with a super fast metabolism, and you get overly underweight and a lose of strength. </p>

<p>One day, I decided to buckle down, cut drinking cold turkey, eat more, and change for the better. </p>

<p>I had some previous gym experience freshman year of college and some from a little bit before covid, so I felt somewhat comfortable trying to get back into the swing of things. I used some of what I knew previously, as well as looking thru the fitness wiki and this subreddit, to decide on what routine I&#39;d get myself into. Ultimately, I decided to use the program listed in this post here: <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Fitness/comments/37ylk5/a_linear_progression_based_ppl_program_for/?utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_source=share">Link</a>. </p>

<p>I decided on a PPL split only because that&#39;s what I used to do before, it&#39;s what I felt most comfortable with, and I couldn&#39;t figure out the difference between all the other splits with the information overload. I adapted some of it to fit some of the workouts I wanted to include, and it&#39;s changed over time. Listed below are what I started with (with weights) and what I&#39;m currently at (with weights). One disclaimer: I did end up switching gyms, so some of the weights don&#39;t translate properly. I don&#39;t understand why at different gyms or between different equipment, some weight numbers mean different things on different machines, but it is what it is. </p>

Oak Tree Step Out: 1x20 @ 25<br/>
All x2, Every Other Day </p>

<p>So yeah, there&#39;s that. I usually do this six days a week, barring any outside circumstances. </p>

<p>As for my diet, that&#39;s a strange thing. I&#39;m the type of person that is perfectly content with eating the same three meals, every day, with minimal effort in making all three. People make fun of me all the time, but it is what it is. The schedule of my job doesn&#39;t really allow me to cook dinner often either. I try and eat things that are cheap, high in protein, and high in calories. If I can get all three of those things, I&#39;m happy with eating it. With that, my daily meal and snack list is the same. Same bowl of cereal for breakfast, same turkey sandwich for lunch, same frozen pasta bowls for dinner. Listed below in the link are screenshots of all three meals and a snack, as well as the nutritional content of what I get throughout the day. I know I probably eat too much protein and maybe sodium. If anyone has suggestions, feel free to let me know. </p>

<p><a href="http://imgur.com/a/Sg0sZc8">Diet</a> </p>

<p>Other things to include:<br/>
- In the past month and a half, I&#39;ve started to use pre-workout. I personally use Pre-Jym.<br/>
- In the past month or so, I&#39;ve started to use creatine. </p>

<p>Main things I&#39;ve learned:<br/>
- Form is most important (given).<br/>
- Breathing control is second most important (basically, to me).<br/>
- Eating more and better really did make a world of difference.<br/>
- You can surprisingly go up in weight wayyyy quicker in the beginning than I thought. </p>

<p>Things I&#39;m working on:<br/>
- Mainly incorporating deadlifts into my routine. Thinking about first exercise on my pull day before barbell rows. Would remove back raises.<br/>
- Trying to focus on my chest. Always been the weakest part of my body. Not exactly sure how to be more dynamic and really hit it hard. </p>

<p>Things holding me back:<br/>
- From three to six months, I feel like I&#39;ve had minimal visible change. I&#39;ve increased in weight a decent bit in some areas. Am I plateauing? (hence use of pre-workout and creatine).<br/>
- For the last few weeks to months, I&#39;ve had progressively worse left golfer&#39;s elbow tendinitis. I&#39;ve been working to reduce the root cause of it while increasing the stretching of my wrist/forearm area. I have been working thru it currently (although it&#39;s probably not recommended).<br/>
- My right shoulder is weird. Overuse of throwing a baseball (possibly incorrectly) when I was younger has caused it. Kinda feels like it pops a lot. Kinda feels painful at times. Kinda seems like rotator cuff, but really not. I don&#39;t think it is. Who knows. </p>

<p>But yeah, ultimately that&#39;s my progress, journey, and guide to where I&#39;m at now. I&#39;m open to suggestions on any aspect of what I&#39;ve done so far, whether it be focus exercises or dietary changes, so please let me know! Thank you all very much.</p>

<div class="md"><p>Well, to each their own, but when you can see your ribs, you have what feels like a recessed chess when you look in the mirror, and that the only thing attached to your arms is barely any muscle and no fat, you begin to feel very underweight 🤷🏻‍♂️</p>

<div class="md"><p>be careful with how you develop sources of self-esteem. that entire post is body dysmorphic and its not a good thing if that starts dominating your life. the fact you&#39;ve now been told be a fair few people that you don&#39;t look how you think you do, should help you realise that. your progress has been good tho and your 6 month pictures look good. you have a small frame, don&#39;t compare how you look to anyone other than shorter, smaller framed people. i am 5&#39;6 and i would be skin and bones at 130lbs cos i have a much bigger frame than you. your 6 months picture is what i look like at 170lbs.</p>

<div class="md"><p>I was 130lbs at 6’1 and was a great cross country athlete. Very little muscle but fit as hell and could run for ages, I could run a 12 second 100m as well. Society really is making us believe we’re supposed to be absolute tanks if we want to look like a real man. </p>

<p>I’m between 160-165lbs these days which is a lot better/ healthier (I only put on muscle really, not much fat. Grinded the gym for a bit). I feel like there is a huge different between someone who is quite lean and fit that eats right compared to someone who eats very little and does no exercise.</p>

<div class="md"><p>That&#39;s being tall for you. I&#39;m 6&#39;3&quot; on the dot and started at what I considered to be an underweight 165-170.

<div class="md"><p>Oh it’s great that you have that experience, I’ll try to focus on the numbers, but I think appearance change is way more rewarding for me.
And now thinking about it, probably the reason we don’t see change is because the mass we’re gaining is mostly muscle and it is very compact. </p>

<p>Damn. This is fitness 101 and everyone (including me) seems to always wonder the same things over and over. We should really be more educated about this in schools.</p>

<div class="md"><p>6&#39;3&quot; and 135 does not automatically make you unhealthy or underweight.  I have always eaten a lot, and when I&#39;m not trying to put on weight, that&#39;s just where my body settles at.  I would probably be 140-150 if I didn&#39;t try to maintain my weight. The 135 was 10+ years ago, before I was fully grown, so neither me or my doctor was surprised or concerned.</p>

<p>&#x200B;</p>

<p>Everybody is different. BMI charts and &quot;normal&quot; weights vs height are not set rules.  But talk to a doctor if you&#39;re concerned, not some stupid redditor with an anecdote.</p>
