<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I&#39;m thin, fit.</p>

<p>Recently (last month or so) whenever I eat carbs I get dizzy beyond belief and basically need to rest.  But if I don&#39;t eat carbs I&#39;m fine.  Yesterday I made 12oz bacon (by itself), ate it, and felt AMAZINGLY WONDERFUL afterward.  I mean like I had energy, mood, etc.  Everything was great.</p>

<p>Today I ate a slice of pizza and was so dizzy I couldn&#39;t get up for like 30 minutes.</p>

<p>I just ate some rice along with lots of grassfed butter, salmon, and broccoli, and am experiencing noticeable dizziness.</p>

<p>Have I ruined my guts with the Kombucha I drank a few weeks ago?  The only other thing I can ponder is, I sometimes do edibles in low doses, and I&#39;ve heard of people &quot;feeling high when they&#39;re not&quot; after stopping when their body burns fat for fuel (thc is stored in fat) but THIS MAKES NO SENSE if it&#39;s happening after eating carbs.  It almost feels drunk, but I haven&#39;t had alcohol in 3 years.</p>

<p>&#x200B;</p>

<p>edit - fasting glucose 88, b12 500, folate 14</p>

<p>&#x200B;</p>

<p>edit 2 - to be clear, &quot;low doses&quot; of edibles means like 2.5mg at a time.  I have a LOW tolerance.  10mg (a normal dose for most) and I&#39;m gone.  I&#39;ll do 2.5mg every few hours when I do do it, which isn&#39;t that often.</p>

<div class="md"><p>Have you tested your blood sugar 1- 
2 hours after eating? If that&#39;s when you&#39;re feeling symptoms that&#39;s when you should try testing.</p>

<p>If you&#39;re not eating a lot of carbs could also be related.</p>

<p>Worth talking to your doctor&#39;s about to make sure everything is good.  Reddit can&#39;t offer medical advice.</p>

<div class="md"><p>You are monitoring which is good, honesty there is a weird stomach bug that swept up my sons school ( everyone on high alert cuz of ‘19”   Are you new to paleo?  </p>

<p>Additionally something people don’t consider when eating healthy is that salt/sodium is actually really important</p>

<p>Consider broths and stuff on the healthy end or gimilayan Celtic and the sorts. Well hope it gets better that sounds like it sucks</p>

<div class="md"><p>Your fasting number doesn&#39;t matter. Its the post carbs number that does. If you&#39;re dumping insulin like a champ over a slice of pizza, a dip into the low 60s could absolutely do that.</p>

<div class="md"><p>I&#39;m wondering if you have auto brewery syndrome, where yeast in your body cannot be digested and ferments into alcohol basically so you get a little drunk but based on how you&#39;re explaining it happening 30 mins after eating  it seems a little too quick for your body to ferment into alcohol thou... Worth seeing a doctor for sure.</p>

<div class="md"><p>Same thing happens to me, I think it&#39;s related to how my body processes sugars/carbs. I can eat a big plate of veg and feel lightheaded shortly after. If I add see avocado, nuts, tofu meat, etc. I am fine.</p>

<p>Nutritionist told me I should pair carbs with healthy fats or proteins. This solved the issue.</p>

<p>I think my blood sugar drops in response to a sudden high intake of carbs. Like someone else has said, testing your blood sugar before and after could be helpful if it&#39;s worrying. I&#39;m not diabetic, I have hypothyroidism but it&#39;s not obviously related.</p>

<div class="md"><p>Were the carbs from gluten or non-gluten sources?  </p>

<p>Sometimes, vertigo and nausea can be caused by a histamine intolerance, but carbs are usually low in histamines, so I would keep a food journal and track any other non-carb foods that make you feel dizzy.  I think the exception is gluten but I&#39;m not a specialist so please do your own research on this.  Do not trust me.</p>

<p>The pizza I&#39;m presuming was gluten.</p>

<p>I can have a smoothie in the morning (blueberries, banana, almond milk, whey, walnuts) and feel fine  That&#39;s lots of carbs right?</p>

<div class="md"><p>When my insulin spikes up to pull blood glucose down after eating carbs I can feel dizzy or light headed. So, I avoid. I also do great emphasizing protein and some fat and my brain is happy and clear on ketones. </p>

<p>Insulin resistance is linked to Alzheimer&#39;s among other things, so to me, all the more reason to steer clear of too much starch or sugar.</p>
