Merits of vegetables for gaining?

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Was thinking about this the other day and figured it would be a fun thought experiment. Before you go off lecturing me about the merits of eating vegetables, I don&#39;t want/need to hear it. I&#39;m a healthy 20 y/o that eats vegetables fairly regularly. I know that vegetables are important for longevity and overall health, but let&#39;s be honest, that isn&#39;t that important for someone as young and healthy as me. I never even touched a vegetable before the age of 14. There will eventually be a point where only eating anabolic foods will cause cardiovascular issues, but that&#39;s far off. Don&#39;t use habit building as an argument here.</p>

<p>I&#39;ve been on my gaining journey for a little over a year. I ate a minimal amount of vegetables in the first 6 months of gaining, because of their low calorie density. Basically, vegetables took up valuable space in my stomach that I needed to devote to more calorically dense, protein-rich foods. After about half a year of progressively overloading my daily calorie target, I was able to reintroduce vegetables without getting in the way of my calorie goals.</p>

<p>Basically, I&#39;m wondering if a no-vegetable diet could potentially be a useful strategy for hard gainers. Are there instances where some would be better off eating a diet of grass-fed meat, whole grains, dairy, and fruit? A common pro-vegetable argument is benefits on gut health, but I think you could easily stick to a mostly whole foods diet consisting of these other groups, thereby cancelling out the effects.</p>

<p>If you don&#39;t want to hear about the merits of eating vegetables then I&#39;ll oblige you. They aren&#39;t protein or calorie dense. So yeah they&#39;re pretty shit.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>lol</p>

<p>Very confused about the point of your thread. The title of your thread and second sentence are in direct contradiction, and you list the notable benefits of vegetables then say you don&#39;t want to hear it/you&#39;re not interested.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Are there instances where some would be better off eating a diet of grass-fed meat, whole grains, dairy, and fruit?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>If you really want to know, the answer is no. Vegetables are a part of a healthy diet for a reason lol. Apparently you don&#39;t want to hear that, but this is the correct answer to your question. You don&#39;t have to eat a lot or even include them every meal, just enough to get some vitamins, minerals, fiber, etc.</p>

<div class="md"><p>I should have phrased it slightly differently. I meant I don&#39;t want to hear about the general merits, I&#39;m exclusively focused on their value for gaining. And I stand by the second quote, in my first 6 months where I ate no vegetables versus the last 8 or so months where I have ate them, my life has not changed at all. I was perfectly healthy (albeit underweight) then and am still perfectly healthy now. And its incredibly uncommon for any healthy person as young as me to develop blood pressure or cholesterol problems, probably the two biggest concerns with eating such an anabolic diet centered around animal products.</p>

<div class="md"><p>Then no, they have virtually zero benefits since you&#39;re choosing to exclude those things which make vegetables worth eating lol. It&#39;s like asking what&#39;s good about steak from a bodybuilding standpoint but then forcing the person that is answering to overlook the fact that it&#39;s a high protein source that is relatively lean, naturally contains creatine, etc. It just doesn&#39;t make sense. I mean what the hell else is there to a steak?</p>

<p>Veggies aren&#39;t calorie or protein dense, and those are the two main factors that determine what foods are good for gaining weight. If you&#39;re getting bigger and stronger, 95+% of your success in the dieting realm can be attributed to simply the amount of calories and protein you&#39;re eating. Veggies won&#39;t help you there.</p>

<p>Obviously do what you want, but excluding vegetables from your diet is a tremendously stupid decision.</p>

<div class="md"><p>I&#39;m not sure if you are looking for scientific answers or anecdotes, so I&#39;ll give you the latter.</p>

<p>I know that when I find myself maintaining a well-balanced diet throughout the week, I feel generally better about myself. I know they&#39;re good for you, so it does my my brain and body good to fulfill that portion of my diet.</p>

<p>And I&#39;m not sure about the stomach space, since I don&#39;t feel like they take up that much room. To me, it&#39;s very easy to eat a serving with my lunch and dinner, and I feel like I&#39;d be doing my body injustice by trying to substitute that for a few extra grams of protein.</p>
