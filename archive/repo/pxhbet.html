Help with Quick and filling Lunch time snack

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I have a new part time job.  3 days a week as a teacher assistant at a preschool for children with special needs.  Iâ€™m on the clock 8:15 until 1:45 with absolutely no breaks except to run to the bathroom as needed.  Itâ€™s fast pace and because of Covid we cannot sit down and eat a snack or lunch with the kids like they apparently used to be able to do.  So itâ€™s literally waiting for a calm moment at lunch and pulling your mask down at the far end of the room and cramming food in your face.  Iâ€™ve been observing the other teachers and assistance to see how theyâ€™re managing and theyâ€™re managing with Pepsi and donuts or chips throughout the morningðŸ˜’ I am unmedicated type 2 diabetic and this is simply not an option for me.  Yesterday was my best day yet because I ate extremely dense/fatty breakfast and I packed deli ham and Swiss cheese rolled up. I was actually fine and ate a healthy snack in the car when I got out, wasnâ€™t ravenous or anything.  I donâ€™t want to make deli meat a habit.  I do love it so much but Iâ€™m concerned with the risk of breast cancer that itâ€™s associated with and donâ€™t want to do it regularly.  Any other ideas? It really needs to be something thatâ€™s like 4-5 bites and filling.  Iâ€™m a substitute and float to different rooms so no nuts  or peanut butter because some rooms have allergies.</p>

<p>Thanks for any suggestions you can offer!</p>

<div class="md"><p>Hard boiled eggs and prosciutto is my bfâ€™s go-to quick snack that keeps him sustained during the school day (heâ€™s a teacher and sometimes doesnâ€™t even get a chance to eat a regular lunch). If youâ€™re able to prep ahead of time, maybe scotch eggs? </p>

<p>Maybe some unsweetened applesauce pouches? Or those fruit &amp; veggie ones</p>

<div class="md"><p>Bummer that nuts are a no go but good on you for steering clear if the donuts.  When I started the low carb lifestyle, I made a lot of biltong, like beef jerky but with natural ingredients.  That and some Tillamoos were my go to.  It&#39;ll take a month or so to make biltong, but Walmart &amp; other places carry it, maybe with a few preservatives. </p>

<p>After a few months I was working 7-5 &amp; skipping lunch on a regular basis.</p>

<p>Best of luck</p>
