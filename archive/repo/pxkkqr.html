Cast Iron Seasoning?

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Hi everyone,
Considering most cast-iron pans are pre-seasoned with vegetable oil (trying to avoid), how can I remove the seasoning so I can use my own cooking fat?</p>

<div class="md"><p>Jeez.  Chill.</p>

<p>I&#39;ve been a cast iron kinda guy for decades. From my beloved 1940&#39;s Griswold pan to my now Victoria daily driver. That &quot;pre-seasoning&quot; means nothing.</p>

<p>Just keep cooking meat in your pan, all will be well.</p>

<div class="md"><p>Lye bath, yellow oven cleaner, self cleaning oven (although this could warp/damage it), steel wool scrub. Curious though... What exactly are you worried about on the factory seasoning? It&#39;s pretty much polymerized on to the pan. Its not like you are really ingesting any meaningful quantity.</p>

<div class="md"><p>Won’t the vegetable oil leach into whatever meat I’m cooking in the pan?</p>

<div class="md"><p>I&#39;m not going to say you will never ingest anything from the seasoning but we are talking very miniscule amounts. It&#39;s not like cooking in actual veg oil. When you season a pan you are wiping out as much oil as possible, just to leave  enough to create a coating. Additionally as you cook with your oils of choice you will build up additional seasoning from that oil, thus further negating any negatives of the original seasoning.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Polymerized oil is more like a plastic than a fat, which makes it hard and resistant to sticking. By heating the whole pan to a high enough temperature, you permanently bond the oil to the raw iron. In this form, it protects the metal from air and food.</p>

<div class="md"><p>Don&#39;t listen to the top comment.  Seriously light soap will clean it off with no damage.  Then just heat the pan on low with kosher salt and bacon fat for however long you feel comfortable.  Not rocket science.</p>

<p>EDIT:  Fuck me.  Go ahead and clean your pan with lye and stick it in your oven.</p>

<div class="md"><p>You can strip it but it would be really overkill. The oil reacts with the heat to form a hard polymerized layer. You don&#39;t eat it. You would only eat it if it starts flaking and if it does no matter what type of oil you used to season it, you need to strip it to get rid of that problem anyway.</p>
