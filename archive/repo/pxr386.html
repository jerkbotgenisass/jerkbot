What body part of a Belmont would be the most muscular?

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I’d go with legs and butt. He does a lot of jumping and crouching. But the biggest reason I say this is stairs. He goes up and down so many stairs. If he gets hit while on the stairs he stays on the stairs as opposed to his usual knock back. This requires a low center of gravity along with core strength. </p>

<p>Yeah he has the whip and he throws stuff. I don’t know about you but I don’t get winded when I throw a bottle of water on the ground. I do however get winded going up and down stairs. </p>

<p>Idk… what do you guys think?</p>

<div class="md"><p>Now I imagine every CV main character from SOTN onwards having jacked legs not because of the whole running and jumping, but the fact that they can dive kick and bounce repeatedly on top of candles and enemies.</p>

<p>Alucard, Soma, Jonathan, Shanoa and by extension Miriam all have Chun-Li&#39;s killer thighs.</p>

<div class="md"><p>Easier maneuvering, dexterity, endurance. If I was a Belmont today,  I would be doing bjj, combat Sambo, traditional boxing, any training in any weapons I could buy, borrow or steal, rucking even comes to mind. If I was a Belmont, I would even seek active combat duty just so I know what killing another person is like before fighting a vampire. </p>

<p>Also, I&#39;m thinking swimming, acrobatics, muay Thai, and just about anything that I could do to turn my body into a weapon. Anything soft would be made hard by the tempering of the steel of my body.</p>

<div class="md"><p>You aren’t describing moves that Belmonts can do or do well. </p>

<p>Belmonts are extremely bad when it comes to water and most can’t swim, it is instant death for them because they drown. In CV4 the poison swamps aren’t instant death probably because they have some viscosity and he can jump out before sinking. </p>

<p>I’d also argue Belmonts aren’t very acrobatic or have easy maneuvering. Most have a set jump height, distance, and direction, as opposed to a video game character like Samus.</p>

<div class="md"><p>If there was an acrobatic Belmont, Richter would be it. </p>

<p>I was thinking last night, how a game where you could play as multiple Belmonts would play out. I put Simon as the tank, able to endure many hits. Richter as a rogue archetype, easily maneuvered and quite powerful but easy to kill. Juste would be a mage and Trevor would be a summoner, able to call upon aspects of Sypha, Grant, and Alucard. I&#39;ve no ideas for Christopher or Julius however.</p>
