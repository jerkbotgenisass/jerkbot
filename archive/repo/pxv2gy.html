Early Morning Energy Boost

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I believe I’m looking for a needle in a haystack but I’m hoping this group can help. I recently started going to the gym at 5am. Since it’s so early I feel I need some sort of energy boost to get me going. I do not like most energy drinks or pumping my body full of Taurine. I’ve been drinking Click protein coffee on the way to the gym but it’s sooooooo sweet!! Are there any good options for an early morning energy boost that isn’t sickly sweet? Must be gluten free, prefer low use of artificial or alternative sweeteners. Help!</p>

<p>Edit: I cannot use the blender in the morning since my husband is still sleeping, so looking for something pre-made or powdered (to mix with milk/water) that I can grab and go.</p>

<div class="md"><p>Banana, Water, Protein Scoop mixed into lactose free milk, or an apple are all very very simple. </p>

<p>If you have time for not simple, then coffee and breakfast.</p>

<div class="md"><p>honestly, and this may or may not work for you, but just eat two bananas and drink a shit ton of water.</p>

<p>my buddy calls this his &#39;festival breakfast&#39;. </p>

<p>if we&#39;re ever going to a music fest (and using mind altering substances) or going out for a very active day or day drinking or something silly like that, it just works. it keeps you going. i&#39;ve done this pre-gym many many times and you honestly don&#39;t even notice the lack of having a real stimulant. It may take a bit longer to &#39;kick in&#39; than caffeine or a supplement but give it a try! It might work for you too.</p>

<div class="md"><p>Ok, hear me out; Black...wait for it...coffee.  </p>

<p>Don&#39;t want it hot? Cold Brew. Not as bitter, nice mild flavor. A bit more caffeine. Easy to make at home if you dont want to buy it.  </p>

<p>Want some cream? Add a Premier Protein of your choice.</p>

<div class="md"><p>I make and freeze unsweetened or savory muffins, there are lots of good gluten free recipes out there (Check out TQI muffins or egg/ham cups). I take one out of the freezer in the am and it’s thawed by the time my coffee is brewed. It takes a bit more planning and time up front but in my experience “quick energy” is almost always too good to be true - in the long run there’s no convenient substitute for real, whole food.</p>

<div class="md"><p>Soylent - I use it for all my quick meals. Good protein content, plant based, and they have coffee types. They last a long time in the fridge, don&#39;t taste bad, and are very healthy. Think slimfast for people who are serious about health.</p>

<div class="md"><p>aside from food options given above, my favorite energy boost/reset/wake up/ whatever is a face full of cold water. </p>

<p>in the summer I have an ice slurry in a big ol bowl on the counter 24/7 and I&#39;ll ram my face into it if I&#39;m feeling tired or I need to calm down or I need a big reset. A normal person could get away with a cold face wash in the morning or a cold shower</p>

<div class="md"><p>Sweet potato. Brown sugar. Lemon juice. </p>

<p>Sweet potato should be poked gratuitously with a form, wrapped in a wet paper towel, and microwaved.</p>

<p>Stoop it before it beeps. Add butter, or olive oil. Brown sugar and lemon juice.</p>

<p>Enjoy</p>
