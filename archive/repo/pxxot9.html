Looking to sculpt this type of body, any tips?

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Looking for a way to sculpt my body into an ideal shape, need advice.</p>

<p>Okay so my ideal body would be sticky, square and leans (with prominent arms, shoulders, neck and forearm assertions)</p>

<p>Like these guys:</p>

<p>However my body is more on the mesomorphic type, my height is 5’11 and I weight around 190lbs. I have around 13.5 inche arms and a 34 inch waist (yes skinny fattish) I don’t mind not being totally lean but I want a big lean look like this guys in the pictures I’ve provided. What the best way to go about this? </p>

<p>I was going to start eating a high fat diet as I’m told that it will help increase arm size and target areas with my more fat after workouts aswell?</p>

<p>Essentially I’m looking for a workout plan and eating suggestions </p>

<p>Thanks</p>

<p>This is new. Its also utter bullshit</p>

<p>Like the other comment said - forget everything you&#39;ve heard. Read the wiki on this sub and <a href="/r/fitness">r/fitness</a>. Honestly, read it. Don&#39;t half ass it. Read it.</p>

<p>Maintain or slight surplus, follow an established program from the wikis, get strong, trim the fat later</p>

<div class="md"><p>Hit the weights 3-6 times a week eating at maintenance calories for 8-9 months and then eat at a calorie deficit until you are happy with your physical shape . Also forget everything you were told about eating a high fat diet targeting certain areas of the body . Get your calories and lots of protein in while putting effort in at the gym and you will see results .</p>
