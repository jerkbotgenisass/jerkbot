I actually think most of the top athletes aren’t on PEDs

<div class="post">
<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Here’s why:</p>

<p>I’m 38 and have been doing CrossFit for almost 10 years. I wasn’t an athlete growing up, I don’t have particularly impressive genetics, and I started “late”. In spite of that, I’m kind of fit. Top 20% in the open each year. </p>

<p>I only train 4-5 days a week, I eat well and sleep as well as someone with a two-year old can. Yesterday I only trained for 7 minutes and 19 seconds because it’s what I had time for. I’ve never taken any PEDs, don’t supplement, and haven’t even had caffeine in about 15 years.</p>

<p>With all of that, I’m still fitter 10 years later and improving incrementally year over year. It doesn’t feel impossible to me that people who dedicate their lives to exercise and nutrition can perform at an elite level without PEDs if I can be “above average” with all of the above constraints on my time and energy. </p>

<p>Obviously none of “know” anything beyond our own experience but I’m inclined to give the benefit of the doubt based on my experiences with CrossFit as a casual, but passionate, athlete. </p>

<p>TL;DR - I’m kind of fit and only try kind of hard. Seems to me that people who try really hard can be really fit without cheating.</p>

<div class="md"><p>“Kind of fit” and “individual Games level fit” are in entirely different ballparks. Ryan Hamilton has a joke about how the Olympics should pay a normal person to do the events so we can see what those athletes are really doing. That could be useful here. And maybe you could, with years of dedicated training, compete with them in 1 event… but could you do 16 events in a few days that are all kicked off with a 1 mile open swim and a 3 mile kayak? It’s going to feel a lot different than one 7 minute workout/day. That kind of volume vs recovery is asking a lot more of your body than many people are able to do.</p>

<div class="md"><p>I think a more accurate question would be whether you’re willing to believe that every single person at the top is as virtuous as they claim. </p>

<p>There’s a lot of money to be made. If there are nobodies taking PEDs at the box down the street for no real financial reason, is it really believable that none of the top 100 are willing to take PEDs for the potential to earn hundreds of thousands of dollars?</p>

<div class="md"><p>There’s significantly less money than you think. Probably around 25 (being generous) of the athletes at the games on each side make enough from just competing and sponsorships to live a life focused on crossfit with no outside help. I’d say maybe 10 on each side are making enough to where they can save for later in a meaningful way.</p>

<div class="md"><p>Ok, but the potential is there. The folks at the top are generally making this their full-time gig.

<div class="md"><p>I’m not the commenter you’re responding to, but I agree with their point. I have a pretty good idea of how much money is to be made in CrossFit and that very few are making that money. But I don’t see how that really matters. It’s the <em>potential</em> to make the money that matters. Plenty of minor league baseball players are getting popped for PEDS and those guys aren’t on big contracts with sponsorships. They’re just hoping to get to that point with the big contracts—and that hope is enough.</p>

<div class="md"><p>I think it&#39;s pretty obvious that most of them are on PEDs. There are classic steroid signs everywhere: well known weak testing system, money/fame incentive, insane volume/recovery over a long time frame, unnatural strength gains over a short time frame, Kari Pearce&#39;s voice, Vellner front squatting 387# only weeks after partially tearing his groin, Fraser going from one of the worst runners at the Games to literally the best in one year, Annie finishing 3rd this year, well-known rumors of Noah Ohlsen panicking over a potential surprise drug test at Wodapalooza, Froning&#39;s sustained volume over the past 10 years while virtually injury free, and more. Could any of those be natural/coincidence/miracle? Absolutely. I&#39;m just saying there&#39;s a lot of classic PED smoke...</p>

<p>I see it like the Tour de France in its glory days. They&#39;re all juiced up so it actually evens the playing field. They all have to put the work in and the best will still finish at the top. It doesn&#39;t lessen my enjoyment as a fan at all.</p>

<div class="md"><p>This is exactly it. The probability of the athletes being on gear throughout the year leading up the games is extremely high. Sports enthusiasts who know nothing about androgynous hormone and steroid use can’t see it, but anyone with passing knowledge can tell that the signs of PED use are everywhere, as you’ve stated. It makes no physiological sense how some of these athletes are able to have the abilities and recovery times that many of the athletes do without acknowledging it likely came from PEDs. Simply the lax enforcement and testing alone should be a red flag to even casual viewers, since similar enforcement in other sports has proven to be because of rampant PED use. It’s really no different than any other sport with high stakes and money involved. As a famous UFC fighter once said at a press conference “everyone’s on fucking steroids”. Learning about PED use in other sports and Hollywood has really opened up a whole world that many people simply are ignorant exists. There’s almost zero way Froning could be doing what he does, for as long as he has, and maintained the level he’s at without PEDs. It’s almost impossible.</p>

<p>Absolutely.</p>

<p>Being able to have a quicker turn around between training sessions with recovery means you can get a tonne more volume in.</p>

<p>I want some of that stuff.</p>

<div class="md"><p>Dont change your statement. Its weird that you need to insult me.</p>

<p>I can 100% guarantee you that it is possible to look like Fikowski without peds. He is 6&#39;2 and 220 lbs. I am a bit shorter, have terrible genes and are 190 lbs. I am not the 0.001%, Fikowski is. He lives off training and eating well, I dont. Hell I have a friend at Fikowskis size, only larger upper body and smaller legs. He is an engineer and trains in the evenings.</p>

<p>Do you really not know anyone that has a fair amount of muscle at low bodyfat %? How would they look if they trained full time for 10 years? 15? </p>

<p>How are you even bothering training if you dont think 220 lbs on 6&#39;2 is attainable for the most genetically gifted that lives off excercising? Seriously.</p>

<div class="md"><p>I’m a big fan of the tour. It has a long, long history of cheating as a whole and gives credence to your level playing field assertion. And you very well might be right about CrossFit. It just feels weird to me that so many people are so certain and aggressive about claiming it when they really just don’t know.</p>

<div class="md"><p>Oh, I think I’m aware of how huge the gap is!

<div class="md"><p>I love this. I know people who have been top athletes in various sports, also in strength, and I know people who take peds. I&#39;m more or less the opposite of genetically gifted but I have outlifted my share of people on peds after training smart abt 4 times a week over many years. I have also, almost, been at the level of genetically gifted athletes that train a lot less than me. </p>

<p>What could I, myself, say lift id I was training like a pro the last 10 years? I would wager 30% more, at least. What if I was really genetically gifted? 20% more? </p>

<p>Using these numbers on my max is well above what the strongest games competitors are strength wise. I could probably just take the genetically gifted 20% increase and still be at the top there. </p>

<p>I have no doubt in my mind that genetically gifted athletes that train hard and smart over a long time perform at the level that they do in the games. Its not that unbelievable. </p>

<p>That doesnt mean that I dont think there are lots of dopers in CF. But I also dont believe the people that is stating it as a fact that all are.</p>

<div class="md"><p>some athletes are using, some athletes are not. we will never know until there is a much more formalized and legitimate testing procedure and - while it might be confirmation bias - no one will trust the CFG testing protocols until a top athlete is popped. it feels too coincidental that outside of ricky garard, everyone that pops is a team athlete or some fringe international athlete. if you take weightlifting as an example, they are popping world champions which all the more legitimizes their protocol (even if they are doing it after the fact). and even then there is massive distrust in it to the level that the IOC may dissolve weightlifting as an olympic sport entirely. </p>

<p>but, i don&#39;t necessarily disagree with what is your seminal point. what CrossFit athletes are doing, even at the pinnacle of the elites, is not outside the bounds of genetic potentiation. taking the field as a whole, they are below average weightlifters, slower runners than your average high schooler, and are doing the same gymnastics skills as five years-olds in gymboree. they are so far below the bounds of human genetic potential in any single athletic discipline and i don&#39;t really accept that their convergence of sub-elite skills is somehow a genetic outlier in its own right... there is nothing, biologically or physiologically, that would indicate this. it is novel only because CrossFit is a sport that was invented out of thin air for gym class heroes, and traditional sports have always required single-discipline sport-specific performance. in sport, you are either one or the other, endurance or power, and elite genetic predisposition in one will detract from the other. all this is to say that it is not out of the realm of possibility to do what CrossFit athletes are doing naturally (not definitive proof). </p>

<p>CrossFit is still in its relative infancy as a sport and there are athletes like Mat and Tia that are so much further along on the maturity scale than everyone else. what the field is doing can be done with good coaching, intelligent &amp; structured program design, optimizing for recovery (nutrition, sleep, etc.), and a little bit of luck. there are a lot of dumb athletes and coaches out their banging their heads against the wall doing multiple metcons a day and wondering why they are getting hurt and getting cut early in Games weekend.</p>

<div class="md"><p>Thanks. I think this sums it up well. I’m not dumb enough to think they are all clean, but given my own performance/potential, I can get on board that those with much higher potential and focused training can reach that potential without PEDs.</p>
