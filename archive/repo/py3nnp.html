<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>So im starting to go to the gym since I now have a lot of time on my hands and want to gain a bit of muscle atleast. Im pretty skinny, and some people recommend I bulk by eating 3000 to 4000 calories a day and others say just eat 3 big meals a day and drink 1 protein and creatine shake after breakfast and after a workout. I no nothing about food and am a little intimidated by eating 3000 to 4000 calories a day. Should the 3 big meals a day work just for a moderate amount of muscle growth or just go all out on the calorie diets?</p>

<div class="md"><p>“Big meals” is too broad a term.. every person is different. Find your maintenance cals first. Then add 300-500 per day .. timing of meals doesn’t really matter as much as people make it out to.. just wanna make sure you’re getting some protein within an hour or so of your workout (before or after) and eat some post-workout carbs to replenish glycogen</p>

<p>Oh and eat roughly 1g of protein per 1lb of body weight a day.. could go a little more or a little less, but that’s a solid baseline</p>
