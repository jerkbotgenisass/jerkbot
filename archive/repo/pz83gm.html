<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>New to CrossFit, been going to about 10 weeks now. I have been going 5x a week throughout the week. My legs are constantly tired and sore….  Do I just need to suck it up and power through or should I start taking a day off through the week??</p>

<div class="md"><p>If you’re going that much your first time, you should prolly start some active recovery days. Maybe do some stretching/ yoga, rolling yourself out, maybe massage gun, and increase your protein intake. Honestly that’s impressive that you’ve been doing this 5x a week! If your body feels good, I’d say just keep getting after it, but listen to it should you ever feel “over worked”. </p>

<p>Oh drink as much water as you can!</p>

<div class="md"><p>Let me shill for GOWOD. My mobility sucks and I use it to help improve it, but I like doing longer sessions on my rest days because I feel it helps me with recovery. After a metcon that had 25 deadlifts at 315 made my glutes and hamstrings super sore, a couple sessions helped really loosen me up and alleviated the soreness</p>

<div class="md"><p>Add more mobility and recovery in. 
Depending on your fitness level, 5x a week isn’t too much, but you need to do the not-so fun stuff to balance it. Specifically, roll out your legs every day, stretch and do mobility as well. 
I think that some of those might help with soreness.</p>

<div class="md"><p>Recovery is super important! Make sure to be drinking water, electrolyte drinks, protein shakes, joint de-inflammationers (glucosamine, tumeric powder, etc), getting Vitamin D naturally or with a supplement, and 6-8 hours of sleep a night. Also constantly massaging your joints, muscles, and ligaments should ease the tension. </p>

<p>A protein shake with greens powder right before bed will do wonders for your recovery and inflammation</p>

<p>My first 12 weeks sucked. Went 6 days a week because I knew I was going to be sore anyway and couldn&#39;t just miss class when I was sore. It will get better, but remember that class is just an hour of your day! The rest of the 23 hours should be keeping your body in mind, since you are putting it through a ton of loading</p>

<p>This is also awesome. Once I figured out how to work it for my body, it did wonders for getting out super deep knots in my back, shoulders, and neck.  </p>

<p>Good luck! Worst thing you can do is get injured, so good that you&#39;re keeping an eye on things</p>

<div class="md"><p>I go 5-6x a week plus run and climb. </p>

<p><em>However</em>, I take it easy on at least two of those days. </p>

<p>If it’s a workout I enjoy, I go all in and try and do RX. But if it’s not, I’ll still do it but scale it back. Makes it super sustainable in the long run.</p>

<p>I’d also suggest looking at your diet and your sleep. If I’m low on sleep and don’t eat right my recovery is much harder. </p>

<p>Also, do the warmup and the mobility exercises. I find that those things really help me.</p>

<div class="md"><p>Eat, sleep, stretch, and rest.</p>

<p>There&#39;s a line between a) DOMS that contributes to muscle growth and b) overtraining. It&#39;s quite easy to get into overtraining. 5x a week on its own likely isn&#39;t &quot;too much&quot;, but that depends on what type of work you&#39;re doing. If you&#39;re constantly tired like you say...probably overtraining. you can back off the volume, or the intensity, or prioritize more sleep, good nutrition (ie paleo is bad for sustained energy...we need carbs to fuel intense work).</p>

<div class="md"><p>Most golfers probably not, but I’m 36 and have always been mindful of my mobility… maybe not perfect in the CrossFit realm but not bad for a middle aged dad golfer!  Also more and more golfers are figuring out the importance of fitness and mobility so we are getting there!!!</p>

<div class="md"><p>If I were in your shoes I’d try taking the day off then after a while if you feel like you’re in better shape add it back in and see where it goes, I don’t think anyone is going to say 4x a week isn’t enough…. Unless you want to be games ready or something.  But I have small kids so being sore is a huge pain in the ass for me. There should be a point where you can go five times a week without feeling like you got run over by a bus all the time.</p>

<div class="md"><p>If you&#39;re into supplements, maybe try taking a magnesium glycinate pill each night before bed, along with mobility work, foam rolling, stretching. And if you are really brave....a cold shower or two.  All of these things have aided in my recovery big time</p>
