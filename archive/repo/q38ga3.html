Muscle pain/soreness after carbs experiment on myself

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>So I did a bit of experimenting with non zero carb food and found one thing. I was carnivore for +-2 weeks, then attended some social events, ate carbs and my muscles are much more sore for no reason. Especially calves which I don&#39;t train. What could be the biological process causing this? Water replenishing into muscles? Electrolytes? Anyone had similar experience?</p>

<div class="md"><p>Your post received an &quot;Is Your Google Broken?&quot; report, which is fair, lol.</p>

<p>Try asking at <a href="/r/ketogains">r/ketogains</a>, there are people who do phases of zerocarb, back and forth with keto.</p>

<p>On the fitnessbro subreddits, there are some who will do a zerocarb vince gironda style cut and then eat more carby than keto, you could try asking there as well.</p>

<div class="md"><p>Likely your thinking is on the right track. Carbs are water retentive, which is going to require more salts to balance the water, so in short term might affect electrolytes. Muscle cramps in calves are a classic sing of electrolyte issues, so sounds like you are just short of that. My own occasional trips off the wagon sometimes result in charlie horses and leg cramps.</p>
