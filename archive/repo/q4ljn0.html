<div class="md"><p>I used to be terrified of bench without spotting for this reason. Another redditor posted somewhere if you can&#39;t lift it back up, set it on your chest and roll down to hip crease and sit up and you&#39;ll be able to get out from under it. The biggest mistake here was putting it toward the neck.</p>

<p>Alternatively, have a spotter while trying a challenging weight.</p>

<p>I use a squat rack with Westside spacing. With safety bars set perfectly, it doesn&#39;t reduce ROM and you can unarch your back and it&#39;s on the safety bar.</p>

<div class="md"><p>I’d probably do the same thing instinctively. I use a squat rack at home for all my exercises. When I bench the spotter arms are set to where if I bail on the weight near my neck, they catch it without hitting my body… still stupid I know.</p>

<div class="md"><p>Bit of an excuse, but I feel like those bars get in the way at times because you can&#39;t position them perfectly. So it&#39;s either too high and just mess with your lift or too low where it doesn&#39;t seem like it&#39;d help</p>

<div class="md"><p>Most of them need more adjustability for the reason you pointed out but for me, I will take safety over an inch or so from a perfect lift, especially if I&#39;m lifting alone. Even if the bars are set a little too low that can still be the difference between a broken rib (or death) and an embarrassing squirm to safety from under the bar.</p>

<div class="md"><p>Yeah, I moved my safety bars down a notch, sometimes I would touch one side at the bottom of the rep which threw off my balance a little. 
Where they are now I can put put the bar on them it would squash my chest making breathing relatively uncomfortable, but I can roll it down to my waist, or up to my neck, it doesn’t touch my neck and I can slide (not very gracefully) off the side of the bench, or sit up and slide out if it’s at my waist. I don’t hit them at the bottom of the rep anymore tho!</p>

<div class="md"><p>I&#39;m getting into gyming to lose weight and was on an incline press a few weeks ago with no spotter, the weight wasn&#39;t much(5kgs each side with the standard rod). I did 6 reps and was about to put it back when my strength finished, couldn&#39;t lift it up, was so confused on what to do, thank god it was incline press so I just stood up with the rod and put it back. Meanwhile a guy came when he saw me struggling to put it back to help me as well but by the time I already stood up and put it back. Said thanks to that guy and now I only put weight I know for sure that I can lift up and do max -1 reps so I never get into that situation again. I can&#39;t get a spotter easily as there&#39;s only one trainer in the gym but if I increase the weight, I call him to help.</p>

<div class="md"><p>Red flag 1: ego lifting. The kid was clearly was pushing way too heavy. Technique and form wasn&#39;t completely atrocious but he only got one rep in??</p>

<p>Red flag 2: no safety bars. Always use safety bars if you don&#39;t have a spotter.</p>

<p>Red flag 3: no spotter. Lifting heavy? Ask literally anyone at the gym to spot you, even if they don&#39;t really know the etiquette or have never spotted anyone before. It&#39;s time they learn and the one pushing the weight is still 10000% better off with a noob spotter than nobody at all.</p>

<p>Red flag 4: barbell clips were on--huge rookie mistake. I think people assume it&#39;s always safer to have them on, and in many cases it is; but leaving them off while performing the flat bench press especially with heavy weight and no spotter is actually the best move as far as safety. You can lean over and let the plates slide off on</p>

<p>I hope this kid&#39;s head is okay, that looked really painful.</p>

<div class="md"><p>Yes. But this can cause harm. He also fucked up. When you can’t lift it, you leave it on your chest. He fucked up by trying to rack it on one of the lower rungs and then got himself in the literal worst case scenario of it being on his neck. </p>

<p>You leave it on your chest then try and tilt it off of you by pivoting under it while pressing one side up and pulling the other side down. This can hurt you. It’s better than being crushed to death. </p>

<p>???</p>

<p>You tilt the weight so one side of the bar is on the floor, you aren&#39;t pressing the same weight, you&#39;re pressing less than half the weight which unless you&#39;re doing huge numbers is easily more manageable. Your also still have both arms to use, idk why you suddenly think only one arm is available to you.</p>

<p>I can&#39;t tell you how many people I&#39;ve seen not use clips and not pay attention and over a few sets the weight shifts until a plate falls off one side and they lose balance because the bar isn&#39;t equal weight on both sides anymore. Use clips. Drop the bar to one side.</p>
