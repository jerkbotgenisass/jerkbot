Muscles needed to lift a girl from under the armpits

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>By armpit lift, I mean that lift that all the bullies do in movies when they pin someone against a wall. I am getting a girlfriend soon and I would like to be able to lift her in the air like Its no one&#39;s business. Please tell me exercises, that I need for this, specifically whole body, real world strength. BTW I am looking to lift 130 pounds.</p>

<p>Currently I am able to lift my 155 pound ground 6 inches or so off the ground using that technique. </p>

<p>I guess the difficulty is lifting them when their bodies are somewhat away from yours creating an odd force vector.</p>

<div class="md"><p>i would try one of the other subreddits listed below</p>

<p>basic strength lifts like military/overhead press and bench press. might as well do some curls if your trying to get a girlfriend. &quot;curls for the gurls!&quot;</p>

<p>It&#39;s a slow Saturday, I think I&#39;m gonna leave this up for awhile lol</p>

<p>maybe check out /startingstrength or crossfit.</p>

<div class="md"><p>Bro if you can snatch double body weight you can definitely pick ur chicks armpits up like nobody‚Äôs business. I think the quickest way to achieve this is using PVC to get form down, then doing Bulgarian style trainings with compounds until 2x bw snatch is achieved. (BW should be body weight of desired partner so 130lbs x2 = roughly 120kg let‚Äôs say 125kg to be safe thank u)</p>

<li>Why do you only want to lift them by the armpits? That sounds super uncomfortable lol</li>
<li>Would recommend focus on picking up heavy stuff like deadlifting and getting your back stronger and picking up by wrapping your arms around them.</li>

<p>Good luck üëç</p>
